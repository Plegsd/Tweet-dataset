276412778242252800,Wed Dec 05 19:48:36 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia I agree, the FB app for iOS kinda sucks sometimes too. But I have used it to chat with people from time to time #IBTTalks
276411167344316400,Wed Dec 05 19:42:12 +0000 2012,So @JamesDiGioia I've actually never used gTalk, would you say its better than FB messenger as an SMS replacement? #IBTTalks

276408695590617100,Wed Dec 05 19:32:23 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia @YannickLeJacq My biggest question- do you personally feel you could replace SMS with gTalk, FB chat or iMessage? Go #IBTTalks
276407803709648900,Wed Dec 05 19:28:50 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia I know right! So text messaging was invented when I was only 2 yrs old? Somehow I'm not buying that lol #IBTTalks
276406777426358270,Wed Dec 05 19:24:45 +0000 2012,@YannickLeJacq @JamesDiGioia Texting is now 20 yrs old. Do these alternatives  represent the next wave of digital messaging? #IBTTalks

276404115750395900,Wed Dec 05 19:14:11 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia @YannickLeJacq on iMessage- true, but Android owns WAY more of the market share #IBTTalks
276403765135937540,Wed Dec 05 19:12:47 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia So there are probably bugs to work out. #IBTTalks
276403701097304060,Wed Dec 05 19:12:32 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia Hahaha yea, these apps are just starting to gain enough traction to the point where it affects text messaging stats#IBTTalks
276403199634710530,Wed Dec 05 19:10:32 +0000 2012,What I found most interesting is that when asked, most people voted that they use iMessage the most. #IBTTalks
276402919031586800,Wed Dec 05 19:09:25 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia How does it compare to SMS? Is the experience any different for you? #IBTTalks
276401814415478800,Wed Dec 05 19:05:02 +0000 2012,A report said that texting declined for the first time in the US. Do you think SMS could be replaced by iMessage &amp; FB messenger? #IBTTalks

273879744838262800,Wed Nov 28 20:03:14 +0000 2012,For 7-inch I'd go with the #Nexus7 as for standard, the #iPad4 is a killer. #IBTTalks
273879387731017730,Wed Nov 28 20:01:49 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia Yea, as much as I love my #iPhone5 I can't deny that Samsung has some pretty impressive displays #IBTTalks
273878466720587780,Wed Nov 28 19:58:09 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia I thought about getting a Note 2! I decided to stick with iOS tho. I'm definitely playing with yours when you get it #IBTTalks
273877715592028160,Wed Nov 28 19:55:10 +0000 2012,@redletterdave That would make more sense bc I would get a tablet to replace my netbook and use it more as a work device #IBTTalks
273876532882182140,Wed Nov 28 19:50:28 +0000 2012,@redletterdave No but I've been toying with the idea of getting a #Nexus7 though. Not sure if I need a tablet right now #IBTTalks

273875084110880770,Wed Nov 28 19:44:43 +0000 2012,@MichaelfNunez You have a #Nexus7. Thoughts? #IBTTalks
273874765343768580,Wed Nov 28 19:43:27 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Didn't you dislike the iPad Mini before? I remember you saying it was overpriced #IBTTalks
273873792474951680,Wed Nov 28 19:39:35 +0000 2012,@redletterdave @JamesDiGioia Yea, def too small for creation purposes but good for checking email on the go, etc. #IBTTalks
273872484443512830,Wed Nov 28 19:34:23 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia Some people care more about the portability of a device. 7inch tabs are still good for watching videos on the go etc #IBTTalks
273872087381315600,Wed Nov 28 19:32:48 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia Like anything else, its all a matter of personal preference. Tons of people buy tablets to just use FB or play games #IBTTalks
273871264999931900,Wed Nov 28 19:29:32 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Yea, attractive doesn't mean much if the interface isn't easy to navigate #Surface #IBTTalks
273870583782047740,Wed Nov 28 19:26:50 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Poor Microsoft :( Well, at least Oprah likes the #Surface. She apparently bought 12 of them haha #IBTTalks
273869746498322430,Wed Nov 28 19:23:30 +0000 2012,When it comes to holiday shopping, Apple has such an advantage in its retail presence alone. #IBTTalks
273869577769848830,Wed Nov 28 19:22:50 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Thats what I've heard about the #Surface. Gonna be tough to compete in such a saturated market around the holidays. #IBTTalks
273868073155563520,Wed Nov 28 19:16:51 +0000 2012,Especially since theres the #Nexus7 and #Nexus10 variants now #IBTTalks
273867928150081540,Wed Nov 28 19:16:16 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Totally agree. Google's clearly trying to make its Nexus brand the leader in #Android tablets. #IBTTalks
273867228573753340,Wed Nov 28 19:13:30 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Do you think the iPad Mini is overpriced for a 7-inch tablet though? #IBTTalks
273866694710161400,Wed Nov 28 19:11:22 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Which one did you find the most appealing? Hard to compare #Surface with the Nexus 7 and iPad Mini, but thoughts? #IBTTalks
273866322155274240,Wed Nov 28 19:09:54 +0000 2012,The #Nexus7 is also usually one of the first devices to get #Android updates, so that's a plus for people who care about that  #IBTTalks
273865776337932300,Wed Nov 28 19:07:43 +0000 2012,@JamesDigioia I'm a huge fan of Google's #Nexus7 It's pretty affordable, light, and seems like a solid first tablet. #IBTTalks
273854090574974980,Wed Nov 28 18:21:17 +0000 2012,Which tablet will you be eyeing this holiday season? Come chat with @YannickLeJacq @redletterdave  @JamesDiGioia and myself at 2pm #IBTTalks

268806950672814080,Wed Nov 14 20:05:45 +0000 2012,I think #Win8 is an experimental step, but a necessary one. Eventually it will find its place  among laptops, tabs, PCs #IBTTalks

268803829489872900,Wed Nov 14 19:53:21 +0000 2012,@redletterdave IMO the size of Win8's app store is just as important as how it performs on a desktop #justsayin #IBTTalks
268801753582014460,Wed Nov 14 19:45:06 +0000 2012,Lets talk about the Windows Store for a minute. Its app selection is pretty puny compared to Apple's and Google's #Windows8 #IBTTalks
268799732678279170,Wed Nov 14 19:37:04 +0000 2012,@YannickLeJacq I def think there are some core Windows fans. Or maybe just anti-Apple people (sorry @redletterdave ) #IBTTalks
268798958258774000,Wed Nov 14 19:34:00 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia I think a lot of people will stick with Win7 for a bit unless they plan on buying one of those new Win8 PCs #IBTTalks
268797120985833470,Wed Nov 14 19:26:42 +0000 2012,But to even compete with Apple and Google, they had to try something new. Have any of you played with the #Surface? #IBTTalks
268796984079548400,Wed Nov 14 19:26:09 +0000 2012,@redletterdave I think different is what #Microsoft needed. At the same time, they wanna make sure they don't lose their core fans #IBTTalks
268796091460366340,Wed Nov 14 19:22:36 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia They're really going for the seamless experience across devices thing. But perhaps that doesn't work on a desktop? #IBTTalks
268795206730666000,Wed Nov 14 19:19:05 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia I heard that #Windows8 has a pretty steep learning curve. I guess that means you would agree? #IBTTalks
268793688388419600,Wed Nov 14 19:13:03 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGioia Not yet, unfortunately. Have you? #IBTTalks

266270553969664000,Wed Nov 07 20:07:01 +0000 2012,@redletterdave I can imagine it also had a huge influence on the way other FPS games were made from then on #IBTTalks #Halo4
266270089911885820,Wed Nov 07 20:05:11 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Overall, yea. The franchise has certainly proven itself over the years.Its arguably the biggest Xbox exclusive. #IBTTalks
266268291977342980,Wed Nov 07 19:58:02 +0000 2012,I think just the nostalgia alone when it comes to Halo is a big selling point. It was really the first big FPS before #CoD #IBTTalks
266267847183986700,Wed Nov 07 19:56:16 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Its tough to say, both have different strengths. I would choose #Halo4 personally #IBTTalks
266266265734225920,Wed Nov 07 19:49:59 +0000 2012,@YannickLeJacq I think it depends on what people want. Some may prefer #Halo4 over #BlackOpsII because of the emphasis on story. #IBTTalks
266263096513949700,Wed Nov 07 19:37:23 +0000 2012,@redletterdave @YannickLeJacq Halo has been called Microsoft's most important entertainment product. Would you agree? #IBTTalks

266257757466947600,Wed Nov 07 19:16:10 +0000 2012,#Halo4 has been called Microsoft's most expensive game. Did that come through with what you've seen so far? #IBTTalks
266257280054485000,Wed Nov 07 19:14:17 +0000 2012,He said #Halo4 would have a holistic story that would bring a lot of context from previous games to make it feel complete #IBTTalks

263708635660709900,Wed Oct 31 18:26:52 +0000 2012,@redletterdave Yea, now people can actually leave their homes to see the damage #Sandy caused. Makes it harder to spread fake news #IBTTalks
263706366978453500,Wed Oct 31 18:17:51 +0000 2012,It kind of gave you a snapshot of what #Sandy was like around the country #IBTTalks #Facebook
263706215178203140,Wed Oct 31 18:17:15 +0000 2012,I think people got most of their news from news sources, but I know my FB feed was filled with people talking about #Sandy #IBTTalks
263706066339123200,Wed Oct 31 18:16:40 +0000 2012,I think more than anything people were concerned with being in touch with family, and Facebook was great for that #IBTTalks
263704800896618500,Wed Oct 31 18:11:38 +0000 2012,Facebook helped people connect with fam/friends, Twitter was a constant newsfeed, and Instagram was filled with photos  #IBTTalks
263704571598221300,Wed Oct 31 18:10:43 +0000 2012,I think its great that each social media outlet served a different purpose during #Sandy #IBTTalks

261136259727126530,Wed Oct 24 16:05:10 +0000 2012,@YannickLeJacq Thats definitely true. But imagine how much more appealing it would be if it were more competitively priced? #IBTTalks

261135467926405120,Wed Oct 24 16:02:01 +0000 2012,@YannickLeJacq Definitely. But it would KILL the 7-inch tabs if the price was a little lower @IBTTalks

261126615969431550,Wed Oct 24 15:26:51 +0000 2012,I think more than anything else the Windows store is standing in Microsoft's way #Windows8 #Surface #IBTTalks
261126369273057280,Wed Oct 24 15:25:52 +0000 2012,@JamesDigoia i.e. the Xbox, Microsoft Office, etc. #IBTTalks
261126212875845630,Wed Oct 24 15:25:15 +0000 2012,@JamesDiGoia I think Microsoft needs the #Surface and #Windows8 to stay relevant, but they're still successful in other areas #IBTTalks
261125511256870900,Wed Oct 24 15:22:28 +0000 2012,Especially since #Surface isn't trying to compete with #KindleFireHD or #Nexus7. It's taking on the #iPad #IBTTalks
261125107706118140,Wed Oct 24 15:20:51 +0000 2012,@YannickLeJacq Sadly I'm not too surprised. As much as I want the #Surface to be good, #Microsoft has some tough competition #IBTTalks
261124511993315330,Wed Oct 24 15:18:29 +0000 2012,Yea if the tablet industry isn't already over saturated, it will be soon. Especially if @Microsoft is successful with the #Surface #IBTTalks
