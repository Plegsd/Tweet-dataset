917629438925299700,Tue Oct 10 05:54:41 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman Mostly older people in development. Some in poor health. Evac’d so fast they didn’t bring clothes, phones, or medicine.

916694524960710700,Sat Oct 07 15:59:40 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman So humble yourself before the craft, be thankful you have the boss-job, and really remember that no one wants to fuck you.
916693763707174900,Sat Oct 07 15:56:39 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman It’s a sad but necessary day in boss life when u realize you’re not actually as popular as your employees make u feel.
916692955980689400,Sat Oct 07 15:53:26 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman Being a boss means playing by different rules. It means carving yourself out. That’s what the extra $ is for.
916692253929803800,Sat Oct 07 15:50:39 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman I have literally announced it first day in the room: I will never hug you people. I like you. I’m a hugger IRL. But not you.
916691632488976400,Sat Oct 07 15:48:11 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman ...I won’t create an expectation for other writers that a hug hello is what should be done to be on “equal” status w/ others.

916690455819051000,Sat Oct 07 15:43:30 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman Or at least recognize that it isn’t going to happen. You’re the Omega Man. You’re the emotional terrorist. Your actions.
916690062376558600,Sat Oct 07 15:41:56 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman Speaking Truth to Power is a luxury most people can’t afford. It’s a manager’s responsibility to create a place for that.

912094819337375700,Sun Sep 24 23:22:05 +0000 2017,I've had people I work with--friends--say to me: You took the $. And I'll say: So I'm a whore, yes? And they respond: KINDA.
912094242381611000,Sun Sep 24 23:19:47 +0000 2017,This isn't some rant about some bad notes call. But as a writer who's been labeled difficult a lot, I think about my role in that.
912087553053941800,Sun Sep 24 22:53:13 +0000 2017,Or shouid I, as a well-paid employee of Corporation X, just shut up and play ball?
912087287998984200,Sun Sep 24 22:52:09 +0000 2017,Is a story told in a less optimal, less personal way (according to the artist) a compromise to the community? Bad art and bad politics?
912086903398080500,Sun Sep 24 22:50:38 +0000 2017,Forget if the notes have overt political implications (few would). But what about implications more subtle? Just a bad story idea?
912086460966121500,Sun Sep 24 22:48:52 +0000 2017,...what is my obligation to my story? What if I get notes that I don't agree with (which I always do). I took the $...
912086020278992900,Sun Sep 24 22:47:07 +0000 2017,SOO...As an employee of whatever corp employs me these days, knowing that writing and creating is inherently political...that STORIES are...
912085646516273200,Sun Sep 24 22:45:38 +0000 2017,...that doesn't it's a polemic. But simply it cannot be read apolitically. Even if all we want to do is tell a great story.
912085394929344500,Sun Sep 24 22:44:38 +0000 2017,SP film was very political. It's not set up to NOT be political. So every decision made for show is part of a large set of symbols...
912084812399222800,Sun Sep 24 22:42:19 +0000 2017,I had a long discussion on Snowpiercer set re this. And the actor said to me: Right now, making something great is radical politics.
912084307115515900,Sun Sep 24 22:40:19 +0000 2017,If your work can reach an individual and you can say to that person: you are not alone. I feel what you feel. That's a political act.
912084017398276100,Sun Sep 24 22:39:10 +0000 2017,Is telling a great story, a personal story, a specific story, a political act? Of course it is. Even when it isn't, it is.
912083635670458400,Sun Sep 24 22:37:39 +0000 2017,But entertainment, like sports, is inherently political. The stories we tell, the actors we cast, the crew we hire, the norms we reinforce.
912083259235876900,Sun Sep 24 22:36:09 +0000 2017,So many would say: yes, you fucking idiot. They pay you. You took the money. You do what they say. Like anywhere else. Sure. Maybe.
912083035465453600,Sun Sep 24 22:35:15 +0000 2017,It's not "compromise." It's a substitution of someone else's idea as to what makes good story. It's not half-mine, half-theirs. It's theirs.
912082742002589700,Sun Sep 24 22:34:06 +0000 2017,In fact, what we're told is, if there's disagreement, we go w/ note given by exec. Because they know better? No. Because they're the boss.
912082192536289300,Sun Sep 24 22:31:55 +0000 2017,So no deference is given to a writer. All ideas, the writer's and exec's, are of equal weight. Despite the huge difference in qualification.
912081611981647900,Sun Sep 24 22:29:36 +0000 2017,I played bball. I can still hit 75% of my free throws. It doesn't make me LeBron. That seems silly. But WE ALL have opinions about stories.
912081221290569700,Sun Sep 24 22:28:03 +0000 2017,...but also the most banal thing: EVERYBODY WRITES SOMETHING. So how far a leap can it be from a network execs idea to a writer's idea?
912080966616617000,Sun Sep 24 22:27:02 +0000 2017,Writing is both a mystery--what makes someone good at it, how do they come up with all that crazy shit, or put words together beautifully...
912080706204921900,Sun Sep 24 22:26:00 +0000 2017,The parallels in the screenwriting are interesting if also completely different for the lack of a race component (in this area at least).
912080152070283300,Sun Sep 24 22:23:48 +0000 2017,And when its a POC it's always that. Hence "natural" black athletes vs. "crafty and gritty" white athlete cliches.
912079871227990000,Sun Sep 24 22:22:41 +0000 2017,And the effortless grace/beauty/poetry has a side effect of making others think the doer is "lucky" or " a freak." They don't see the work.
912079414615195600,Sun Sep 24 22:20:52 +0000 2017,But part of the beauty of an athlete, an actor, a writer,  is that it can make that sweat transparent to an audience...Almost EASY.
912078959029796900,Sun Sep 24 22:19:04 +0000 2017,The arts, like athletics, often involve freakishly specific skills. Yes, there's inherent talent involved. But no one is great w/o craft.
912078625112973300,Sun Sep 24 22:17:44 +0000 2017,Which jobs do qualify us to speak out in the world? Where is the job training or education for that?
912078365271588900,Sun Sep 24 22:16:42 +0000 2017,No one wants to hear from "celebrities" unless it's THEIR celebrity. And the fact a few of them are wealthy is somehow disqualifying.
912077700709326800,Sun Sep 24 22:14:04 +0000 2017,I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said better. But I think a lot about sports a) cuz I love it and b) as it informs my own industry.
912077301466128400,Sun Sep 24 22:12:28 +0000 2017,It's simple at the base level: white people just want POC to shut up and stay in the narrowest of lane--one defined by white people.
912076782546804700,Sun Sep 24 22:10:25 +0000 2017,But if Charles Barkley says he's not a role model people get angry. But if Colin K. expresses free political speech people also get angry.
912076306552021000,Sun Sep 24 22:08:31 +0000 2017,That many are POC and paid by rich white men make the entire arrangement an unavoidable political construct.
912076031657250800,Sun Sep 24 22:07:26 +0000 2017,There is no sportless life. The men &amp; women who play games at a high level are faces of our world...whether we or they want that or not.
912075454604918800,Sun Sep 24 22:05:08 +0000 2017,It's not a long book, but a deep meditation from a man who both taught English lit at Yale and also banned Pete Rose from baseball.
912075111594836000,Sun Sep 24 22:03:46 +0000 2017,One of my fave books on sports in our society is Take Time For Paradise, by Bart Giamatti--Yale Prez, Baseball Commissioner, Dad of Paul.
911695254792814600,Sat Sep 23 20:54:21 +0000 2017,I always wanted to write a movie about Smith/Carlos but as a white guy decided it wasn't my story to tell.
911694999783227400,Sat Sep 23 20:53:21 +0000 2017,Spend ANY time reading history of the Olympics--not just Owens and Smith and Carlos and Ali--sports and politics have NEVER been separate.
911694533871640600,Sat Sep 23 20:51:29 +0000 2017,Also in elementary school a girl I had a crush on was a Jehovah's Witness and didn't say the Pledge of Allegiance. I loved her for that.

910949677394047000,Thu Sep 21 19:31:42 +0000 2017,@MillerLoLife I do believe one of the biggest challenges of location shoots for any showrunner is humor recalibration.
909623018917204000,Mon Sep 18 03:40:02 +0000 2017,...if they see other nets being rewarded for chances they've taken.
909622948243292200,Mon Sep 18 03:39:45 +0000 2017,I do think there's value to Emmys beyond celebration and congratulation inasmuch as networks want to win awards and may take chances...

896230018459869200,Sat Aug 12 04:41:02 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman 90% of showrunners are Monarchs. And 90% of tv writers are serfs with dreams of the castle.
896229281302544400,Sat Aug 12 04:38:06 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman Networks love the Monarch-showrunners. They're malleable, predictable, and won't cause much trouble. Interests are aligned.
896228940817281000,Sat Aug 12 04:36:45 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman nothing against lawyers. My dad, brother and wife are lawyers.  And nothing against showrunners just in it to be in charge.
896228419201110000,Sat Aug 12 04:34:40 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman It's a good job, sometimes I get rich, and it's better than being a lawyer. But they're basically just that.
896228100173901800,Sat Aug 12 04:33:24 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman some showrunners aren't writers at all. Not really. They just use writing as a way to make $$ and wear the crown.

896226768075599900,Sat Aug 12 04:28:07 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman we have more revolutionaries on the TV throne now then we ever had. How many of them keep that spirit remains to be seen.
896226364424167400,Sat Aug 12 04:26:31 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman The challenge is to find your way to the throne and not forgett what you wanted when you started.
896225866581147600,Sat Aug 12 04:24:32 +0000 2017,@Josh_Friedman most writers fancy themselves revolutionaries but it's hard to remember that once you've got a throne and some white boards.
896225537277997000,Sat Aug 12 04:23:13 +0000 2017,At some point in your hollywood career you've either gotta side with the crown or the revolutionaries.

894275230075453400,Sun Aug 06 19:13:24 +0000 2017,When Halle Berry says "You took the WRONG kid!" in the KIDNAP trailer...I don't understand. Is there a RIGHT kid to take?

893906862814441500,Sat Aug 05 18:49:38 +0000 2017,The conversations I have with restaurant servers could fill a book that only I would read but I would totally read.
893566086385287200,Fri Aug 04 20:15:31 +0000 2017,Good factoid: as the nurse was saving my dad's life, the ENTIRE CARDIAC NURSING UNIT FROM THE HOSPITAL was eating at restaurant next door.
893563022085505000,Fri Aug 04 20:03:20 +0000 2017,Also, and this goes without saying, nurses fucking rule. #thusendeththePSA
893562791751073800,Fri Aug 04 20:02:25 +0000 2017,You can and should take the time to know how to save a life. It might be your loved one, or mine, or just a stranger eating pork tamales.
893562394684698600,Fri Aug 04 20:00:51 +0000 2017,So my PSA is obvious: EVERYBODY should learn the newest CPR techniques. It's not hard to learn, it's INCREDIBLY important.
893562051225804800,Fri Aug 04 19:59:29 +0000 2017,Monday he was sent home, weak and shaky. But alive and with a good prognosis. All because a nurse happened to be eating nearby.
893561796237312000,Fri Aug 04 19:58:28 +0000 2017,...and put him on a temp pacemaker. The next day he had surgery &amp; a fulltime pacemaker was installed, taking over for his failed electrical.
893561570948554800,Fri Aug 04 19:57:34 +0000 2017,...bagging my dad and giving him something to shock his heart back. They saved his life. SHE saved his life. They got him to the hospital...
893561398382309400,Fri Aug 04 19:56:53 +0000 2017,She did CPR for five minutes. She did it so hard that she broke his rib. She did it until the EMTs showed up and took over...
893561200046252000,Fri Aug 04 19:56:06 +0000 2017,As this happened, a woman came running over from another table and said: I'm a nurse. Get him on the ground now! She then began CPR.
893561033641480200,Fri Aug 04 19:55:26 +0000 2017,My mom and others saw it happen, because he just STOPPED. They were yelling at him, calling 911...but he was blue. He was GONE.
893560800257781800,Fri Aug 04 19:54:30 +0000 2017,An hour later I find out: he's alive. But (later explained) he hadn't passed out. he'd gone into full cardiac arrest and stopped breathing.
893560547563589600,Fri Aug 04 19:53:30 +0000 2017,But I knew it was bad. Whatever it was. My mom didn't call or text us for a long time. I had nothing except to follow the healthcare vote.
893560300447776800,Fri Aug 04 19:52:31 +0000 2017,I texted: is he alright, awake? My mom said she didn't know. So I started to freak out. A few min later she said: breathing and conscious.
893559868782633000,Fri Aug 04 19:50:48 +0000 2017,I called my brother. We conferred. We both felt something bad was happening. Especially because my mom had gone incommunicado.
893559717720580100,Fri Aug 04 19:50:12 +0000 2017,My dad has a history of health problems. Only a month ago he'd had a little heart event and had had a stent put in. So I was worried.
893559549377953800,Fri Aug 04 19:49:32 +0000 2017,i texted back and she didn't respond. i called her. She picked up. i asked what had happened. She said she couldn't talk. And hung up.
893559326723395600,Fri Aug 04 19:48:39 +0000 2017,I got a text from my mom, it said: "Your dad passed out in a restaurant. We're in an ambulance going to the hospital."
893559158762385400,Fri Aug 04 19:47:59 +0000 2017,Last week I was glued to Twitter, watching the health care vote like u. Little did I know there was a more dramatic health drama occurring.

888062488389967900,Thu Jul 20 15:46:11 +0000 2017,The thing about @andmichaelgreen is u can root for him and be jealous of him at same time. That's rare in Hollywood.
888061002641662000,Thu Jul 20 15:40:17 +0000 2017,I have real love for this man.  All adjectives apply. https://t.co/q6MbqCZDqY

887884730879754200,Thu Jul 20 03:59:50 +0000 2017,Cancer patients don't need courage. They need good health insurance and early detection. That's why I'm alive. Not because I'm tough.
887884318311235600,Thu Jul 20 03:58:12 +0000 2017,But courageousness is a standard that no sick person should feel like they have to meet.
887883987040874500,Thu Jul 20 03:56:53 +0000 2017,And I'm not mad at people who use the tough narrative re cancer. People want to believe there's some control when there's not.
887883380259409900,Thu Jul 20 03:54:28 +0000 2017,Glorifying strength and not understanding weakness is a dangerous cultural narrative. We end up w/ toxic versions of heroism.
887882911973756900,Thu Jul 20 03:52:36 +0000 2017,I used to fight with TSCC execs about what heroism was and how people should react in the face of danger/death.
887882593298923500,Thu Jul 20 03:51:20 +0000 2017,Survival and morality aren't connected. Survival and courage aren't connected. Pop culture glorifies courage and lacks empathy for weakness.
887882265782403100,Thu Jul 20 03:50:02 +0000 2017,I was a sobbing terrified baby. I took Ativan every fucking day until the surgery. It was isolating and debilitating.
887881718400663600,Thu Jul 20 03:47:52 +0000 2017,There's no tough guy exemption. It's math and it's biology and it's luck and it's money but mostly it's biology and luck.
887881459985391600,Thu Jul 20 03:46:50 +0000 2017,People don't battle cancer. Cancer stands over you like a god from the darkness and debates whether it's your time to die.
887881186755854300,Thu Jul 20 03:45:45 +0000 2017,Cancer is a tough sonuvabitch. That's who's tough. It beat fucking John Wayne. it beats whoever it wants to whenever it chooses.
887880913320779800,Thu Jul 20 03:44:40 +0000 2017,Cancer doesn't particularly care if you stared down the North Koreans or won the Tour De France or were the show runner of a robot show...
887880741186445300,Thu Jul 20 03:43:59 +0000 2017,I wish John McCain well. Cancer sucks. But I'm not a fan of the "Cancer's met a match in this tough guy" narrative.

886647336948174800,Sun Jul 16 18:02:52 +0000 2017,To the extent that I was NOT joking, I only meant writing an episode (long time dream). NOT running Dr. Who. CC will be great at that,
886646942523990000,Sun Jul 16 18:01:18 +0000 2017,BTW when I said todays news made me feel like I could finally write it, I was kinda joking re my propensity for writing female characters.
886624525659455500,Sun Jul 16 16:32:14 +0000 2017,Today's news makes me feel for the first time I could actually write Doctor Who.

885744235021860900,Fri Jul 14 06:14:16 +0000 2017,So it warms my fucking grinchy heart he's able to be who he wants to be and find love. No matter the journey. No Fate But What He Makes.
885743846566486000,Fri Jul 14 06:12:44 +0000 2017,This was a 17yrold boy. Who supported his family with his craft. And had for years. This was the context he lived in back then.
885743662461616100,Fri Jul 14 06:12:00 +0000 2017,They didn't do this TO ANYONE ELSE. TD, blissing me to no end, responded to them: "Shit. My drug dealer is gonna be bummed." And left.
885743421318611000,Fri Jul 14 06:11:02 +0000 2017,...2 Fox execs called TD in for a "meeting." They told him he repped Fox now. And that his "behavior" should take that into account.
885742964923703300,Fri Jul 14 06:09:13 +0000 2017,...she asked them who they liked better. They chose Thomas in a landslide. And so we were allowed to cast him. But after we cast him...
885742736430596100,Fri Jul 14 06:08:19 +0000 2017,In the end, TD got cast because a Fox exec took the 2 screen-tests home to her teenage daughter's sleepover and played them for the girls...
885742541429121000,Fri Jul 14 06:07:32 +0000 2017,I couldn't say: well, my theory is that they think you're too gay for the part. They hadn't said it. HE hadn't said it. I just felt it.
885742386571206700,Fri Jul 14 06:06:55 +0000 2017,Again, TD blew the kid out of the water. But even TD knew something was up. I remember him saying: "jesus. They must just HATE me."
885742181285101600,Fri Jul 14 06:06:06 +0000 2017,Fox went to great lengths to cast somebody else, even flying in a kid from Canada who'd barely acted to screen test against TD's test.
885741993308995600,Fri Jul 14 06:05:22 +0000 2017,No one would ever say that. But again and again I would get coded critiques that led me to that conclusion.
885741836915982300,Fri Jul 14 06:04:44 +0000 2017,Pretty soon I began to believe that their Qs were just code for: "Isn't he a little gay?"
885741650328248300,Fri Jul 14 06:04:00 +0000 2017,Many of these Qs are ridiculous for a 17yrold actor who didn't have to be any of those things for a long time in the story.
885741496510447600,Fri Jul 14 06:03:23 +0000 2017,..or: "Does he really feel like the future leader of the free world?" "Is he a leader of men?" "Is he a romantic lead?"
885741269623857200,Fri Jul 14 06:02:29 +0000 2017,...but when we'd ask their reasoning they'd always say something like: "we aren't sure he feels like a leading man"...
885741105991503900,Fri Jul 14 06:01:50 +0000 2017,We did but kept insisting that TD was awesome and we weren't going to find anyone better. This isn't uncommon in casting...
885740875183083500,Fri Jul 14 06:00:55 +0000 2017,One problem: Fox didn't agree w/ us. It wasn't that they didn't like him, but they had doubts and wanted us to keep looking.
885740587214749700,Fri Jul 14 05:59:46 +0000 2017,I didn't care ultimately because he was so clearly head and shoulders above everybody else who auditioned. I knew it, so did WB.

883129374664511500,Fri Jul 07 01:03:45 +0000 2017,@AoDespair Everything you write, especially everything that makes it to screen, is an opportunity to add something to the social discourse.
883129085492215800,Fri Jul 07 01:02:36 +0000 2017,As @AoDespair said once, every hour of tv is like a story above the fold in the NYT. It's not to be pissed away, or taken for granted.
883128792109035500,Fri Jul 07 01:01:26 +0000 2017,Above all consider your opportunity to tell stories for a living to be participating in the public trust.
883128359051448300,Fri Jul 07 00:59:43 +0000 2017,I would tell TV writers to work like they're journalists: be curious of other people, try to find greater truths, tell a detailed story.
883125971452174300,Fri Jul 07 00:50:13 +0000 2017,We lash out at journalists at our peril. We ignore scientists but science doesn't ignore us. Facts will hunt us down &amp; kill us where we lie.
883125364272226300,Fri Jul 07 00:47:49 +0000 2017,I've been on bad end of reviews, of articles that angered me. It happens. These are hard careers. The free press is our sword against chaos.
883124531430268900,Fri Jul 07 00:44:30 +0000 2017,My best friend is Pulitzer prize winning journalist at NYT. He won for series about distracted driving, for God's sake. Who is that for? US.

864833041474101200,Wed May 17 13:20:39 +0000 2017,RT @scottderrickson: My next directing project: https://t.co/sVY4GlDZA6
863951098167541800,Mon May 15 02:56:07 +0000 2017,This is perfect. RT @emilynussbaum: "It’s possible to both be making things up as you go along and have a plan at the same time."
863595126773301200,Sun May 14 03:21:37 +0000 2017,I think I need a legal guardian.
862372831920836600,Wed May 10 18:24:39 +0000 2017,Their stories may not be any less canon than one I might tell, but it's assumed I'm speaking a common tongue even if I'm not (or they are).
862372161977286700,Wed May 10 18:22:00 +0000 2017,Which  is one of many reasons women are labelled difficult more easily than men are. Their stories are by their gendered nature non-canon.
862371541681668100,Wed May 10 18:19:32 +0000 2017,Which is to say, it's even more difficult for a woman or someone else outside of that common canon to come in and tell a story.
862370976587280400,Wed May 10 18:17:17 +0000 2017,Which is why I imagine they're even more put off when they find we don't have as much overlap as possible.
862370540450873300,Wed May 10 18:15:33 +0000 2017,...it's much more likely that MY story will match up with THEIR story. That Venn diagram of experience and interest and POV should be large.
862370287991619600,Wed May 10 18:14:33 +0000 2017,And not to bring gender into it, but WTF why not...we've been telling straight white male stories for the entirety of cinema...
862368696785940500,Wed May 10 18:08:14 +0000 2017,@steveasbell You're the exception to all the rules Steve.
862367461613731800,Wed May 10 18:03:19 +0000 2017,A writer who oeven entertains that he or she has a right to ask this question is what we in the entertainment business call "difficult."
862367101117452300,Wed May 10 18:01:53 +0000 2017,The Q always becomes w/ an exec: whose story are we trying to tell? Are you trying to help me tell mine? Or expect me to tell yours?
862366620672569300,Wed May 10 17:59:59 +0000 2017,Doesn't mean i'm always right. Or that I always make things people like. And certainly it causes me a lot of trouble. But I don't care.
862366385548275700,Wed May 10 17:59:02 +0000 2017,My personal superpower and my professional kryptonite are the same thing: I am genetically incapable of not telling my story.
862365624105914400,Wed May 10 17:56:01 +0000 2017,You soon find a crisis point: are u being paid to tell YOUR story or A story? Only 1 has a chance to be great. But either can be successful.
862365107543736300,Wed May 10 17:53:58 +0000 2017,But there are obvious problems there: a personal idiosyncratic story puts execs at a disadvantage. They can't manage for that.
862364537613414400,Wed May 10 17:51:42 +0000 2017,It's why I like tv more than film. Over time, more JOSH gets into the things I do. Hopefully more of me is better. I have to believe that.
862364200672395300,Wed May 10 17:50:22 +0000 2017,I have a hard time writing well unless I'm bringing part of myself to the story. Unless I'm TELLING a story. But no one's hiring for that.
862363777819443200,Wed May 10 17:48:41 +0000 2017,You're now part of their process. You're in their system. And their system doesn't require/desire the writer as author but as craftsman.
862363482116829200,Wed May 10 17:47:30 +0000 2017,You're just a story functionary from their POV--you're there to provide a service for them. No one cares if you have a story to tell.
862363226813505500,Wed May 10 17:46:29 +0000 2017,But authorship is the other accelerator here. If u get hired to write "their project," you've already ceded the right as primary storyteller
862362473097306100,Wed May 10 17:43:30 +0000 2017,@scalzi The "justifying their job" trope--which, while probably true, also underestimates the true belief in their intellectual superiority.
862361568620818400,Wed May 10 17:39:54 +0000 2017,If we separate creativity&amp; intelligence we acknowledge writers know what they're doing w/o threatening execs sense of self as smart achiever
862360919309000700,Wed May 10 17:37:19 +0000 2017,Of course there are execs w/ great story sense, but that doesn't mean they're smarter than the ones who don't.
862360432560025600,Wed May 10 17:35:23 +0000 2017,It's not that they're frustrated writers, it's that they don't acknowledge that they can be smart, accomplished, and have no story sense.
862360085233840100,Wed May 10 17:34:00 +0000 2017,So when u disagree w/ execs, I think some interpret it as an attack on their intelligence, rather than an assertion of different skillset.
862355495490908200,Wed May 10 17:15:46 +0000 2017,Creativity and storytelling skill require intelligence, but not necessarily the same type required to problem solve as an exec.
862354836855173100,Wed May 10 17:13:09 +0000 2017,Many of them went to the best schools--probably more of them than the writers they're dealing with. Writers' backgrounds are more varied.
862354302970593300,Wed May 10 17:11:02 +0000 2017,Most execs are highly educated, high achieving, people. They' imagine themselves the smartest person in their class/job/family.
862354041677983700,Wed May 10 17:09:59 +0000 2017,Sometimes I wonder if clashes between writers and execs are due to an undiagnosed war over the role of intelligence in the story process.
860335666948751400,Fri May 05 03:29:41 +0000 2017,This is an economic cleansing. It's a deliberate targeting of a people, a weeding out. A slow motion mass execution of the poor.

856901832010027000,Tue Apr 25 16:04:51 +0000 2017,And unless I do, I should shut the fuck up. And no one should have to hear my voice either.
856901420997632000,Tue Apr 25 16:03:13 +0000 2017,So on days I feel powerless to the demon gods of the electoral college, I remind myself I can make real change around me. REAL CHANGE.
856900150454882300,Tue Apr 25 15:58:10 +0000 2017,If I don't try to make change on my show--the place where I have the most power--than I've failed a test of character.

856898385143627800,Tue Apr 25 15:51:10 +0000 2017,But as pilot pickups are upon us, I want to remind my fellow white dude showrunners: diversity isn't just casting. It's below the line, too.
856898053416026100,Tue Apr 25 15:49:50 +0000 2017,I'm not looking for props from anyone. I'm a long way from where I need to be.
856897508861235200,Tue Apr 25 15:47:41 +0000 2017,I will admit that this is the first show I've ever done where i've specifically gone to the 1st AD and talked about POC crew.
856896974796337200,Tue Apr 25 15:45:33 +0000 2017,I also focus on work. On making SP. And trying to find ways to make the show, both in content and in process, inclusive and empowering.
856896284673941500,Tue Apr 25 15:42:49 +0000 2017,But my head is not in the sand. I don't think any of us can afford to hide--at least not all of the time.

852217011929206800,Wed Apr 12 17:49:03 +0000 2017,Wbtv gave all S1 shows SAME budget. TSCC, Pushing Daisies, Chuck, Big Shots. 2.65m. Think of how different the demands of those shows are.
852216063836147700,Wed Apr 12 17:45:17 +0000 2017,I recall wbtv exec on TSCC telling me no tv show was ever improved by having a higher budget. I'd love to hear him say that to JN/LJ on WW.
852214888529186800,Wed Apr 12 17:40:37 +0000 2017,And the avg. # of eps per season has dropped dramatically. As have residuals based on reruns. Hence our current situation.
852214495111897100,Wed Apr 12 17:39:03 +0000 2017,10 yrs ago TSCC ep budget was 2.65m per. The writers budget was 100k/ep. Now budgets can be 4-5m. Writers budgets are still 100k.
852212482009481200,Wed Apr 12 17:31:03 +0000 2017,Our job is to make the best out of whatever system we have. But the expectations for peak tv are high, and our $ situation is getting worse.
852211902708990000,Wed Apr 12 17:28:45 +0000 2017,Writers fret these things all the time. It's not rhetoric. We want to make the best things we can. And the system will never be perfect
852211442652553200,Wed Apr 12 17:26:55 +0000 2017,So when you see WGA fighting for $ it really is because these $ issues are entwined in how we do our jobs. How we make great things.
852210641989320700,Wed Apr 12 17:23:45 +0000 2017,Most showrunners fear they're going to be fired (cuz a lot are). Like a new football coach afraid to develop a young qb for next coach.
852210235766743000,Wed Apr 12 17:22:08 +0000 2017,The showrunners fails the room as often as the room fails the showrunner. We need to develop talent, not shop for quick fixes.
852209757741916200,Wed Apr 12 17:20:14 +0000 2017,Btw showrunners have a place in the conversation. There's too much writer turnover esp. early in a show's run. We need to show patience.
852208518790643700,Wed Apr 12 17:15:18 +0000 2017,...and tons of writers scrap and claw and balance all sorts of shit while doing awesome work. But that doesn't make security less important.
852208075578540000,Wed Apr 12 17:13:33 +0000 2017,Now obviously there's dozens more reasons. Plenty of rich writers can't write their way out of a paper bag...
852207801359192000,Wed Apr 12 17:12:27 +0000 2017,So perhaps good shows become great by  a) keeping good talent home and b) having showrunners who can afford to solely focus on their show.
852207143176478700,Wed Apr 12 17:09:50 +0000 2017,There's nothing more financially perilous for a working writer than writing/producing a cable pilot that doesnt get picked up.
852206675050102800,Wed Apr 12 17:07:59 +0000 2017,But without an overall deal (and I don't have one), most showrunners cant afford to write a cable pilot, produce it, and wait for a pickup.
852206192726204400,Wed Apr 12 17:06:04 +0000 2017,But I'm a shitty creative bigamist. I'm much more of a swan.
852206020998815700,Wed Apr 12 17:05:23 +0000 2017,I couldn't afford to work exclusively on SP this entire time. So I have to find other work.  Not that I'm complaining. I'm lucky I can.
852205772406538200,Wed Apr 12 17:04:24 +0000 2017,Maybe that seems obvious. But it's not. I finished Snowpiercer script last July. I'm not shooting until THIS July.
852205472476045300,Wed Apr 12 17:03:12 +0000 2017,...but I would imagine that 90% of their creative energy is spent on their show and. It hustling other jobs.

852204663399104500,Wed Apr 12 16:59:59 +0000 2017,But there's also some under-discussed dynamics at the upper levels. With few exceptions, the best shows are made by serial monogamists.

852202327641538600,Wed Apr 12 16:50:42 +0000 2017,.@GennHutchison Often we're forced to choose smaller staffs w/ higher levels or larger w/ younger and less experienced. Rarely both.
852202085361664000,Wed Apr 12 16:49:44 +0000 2017,But great shows get support from their studio ($) can keep talent and continuity. I.e. How long has @GennHutchison working w/ VG?
852201075616632800,Wed Apr 12 16:45:44 +0000 2017,It becomes hard to promote and keep the superstars--they price themselves off your show and seek greener pastures.
852200863904944100,Wed Apr 12 16:44:53 +0000 2017,Because while show budgets have risen significantly over last ten years (and profits) writers room budgets have not.
852200671050735600,Wed Apr 12 16:44:07 +0000 2017,Like a football team with a salary cap, can you keep your best players as they rise through the ranks and become more expensive.

849031334597021700,Mon Apr 03 22:50:19 +0000 2017,We want writers secure enough financially to write that spec that becomes a hit show and employs 250 people for ten years.

849027724651790300,Mon Apr 03 22:35:58 +0000 2017,...it was hard. it cost people A LOT in this town. I wonder sometimes if it cost me my show somehow. But it was the right thing to do.
849027506699092000,Mon Apr 03 22:35:06 +0000 2017,There are many writers more qualified to talk on the specifics than I. But I do want to reiterate: the last strike was NOT a failure...
849026543636455400,Mon Apr 03 22:31:16 +0000 2017,Again I'm not advocating a strike. But I ask writers to consider their own script deals. Did u ever get anything w/o being willing to walk?
849025582486532100,Mon Apr 03 22:27:27 +0000 2017,Without the financial flexibility to do so. And that includes health insurance.
849025455252324400,Mon Apr 03 22:26:57 +0000 2017,Most aren't as lucky as I've been. At least not yet. And its difficult for them to take creative risks, or write specs, or bet on themselves
849025017757159400,Mon Apr 03 22:25:13 +0000 2017,...and believe me when I say that a huge portion of the WGA are working/mid class. Young writers. Older writers w/ families.

849024615519141900,Mon Apr 03 22:23:37 +0000 2017,It was a hard thing for me to do. And I can't say what would've been different had I been there. But I can say I know i did the right thing.
849024335142568000,Mon Apr 03 22:22:30 +0000 2017,I did not edit or in any way participate in post for 90% of the eps. I did not do any interviews for it, or give any advice re the eps.
849024111456079900,Mon Apr 03 22:21:36 +0000 2017,I was heavily involved in the last strike. TSCC debuted during the strike. When we went out I had only locked picture on 1 of the 9 eps.
849023816902692900,Mon Apr 03 22:20:26 +0000 2017,And the only way to do that is support the people we've put in charge to make the best decisions for us. I know many of them. I trust them.
849023642390245400,Mon Apr 03 22:19:45 +0000 2017,I will be voting to give them strike authorization. I don't want to strike. But I do want our union to negotiate to the best of its ability.

791854637187944400,Fri Oct 28 04:10:32 +0000 2016,Trump's about 7,000 hours into his candidacy and at this rate I'm gonna say Malcolm Gladwell is wrong.
791853824759566300,Fri Oct 28 04:07:18 +0000 2016,I dont understand how Trump can give the same speech every day for a year and still sound like he's making it up for the first time.
791852076380725200,Fri Oct 28 04:00:21 +0000 2016,Every time Trump's interviewed he reminds me of 1st 5 min of Quantum Leap when Sam's trying to figure out who he is and WTF is going on.

791430584249622500,Thu Oct 27 00:05:30 +0000 2016,Just like blockbuster trades in sports, when u trade a quarter for five nickels u always lose. And @BryanFuller is a fucking silver dollar.
791430182737371100,Thu Oct 27 00:03:54 +0000 2016,The thing that always puzzled me was the hiring of David Semel to direct the pilot. Didn't seem a good match for BF. That's a CBS decision.

782053408618324000,Sat Oct 01 03:03:57 +0000 2016,Try to step outside yourself and do same thing with your voice/POV. How do I approach scenes? What moves me about what I'm writing?
782053130628272100,Sat Oct 01 03:02:50 +0000 2016,The question to ask is: what would their approach to scene be? What would they find in your story that they would care about?
782052965897031700,Sat Oct 01 03:02:11 +0000 2016,But writing in their voice is not the same as in their style. It's not just syntactical imitation. We can all do bad Sorkin.
782052618541465600,Sat Oct 01 03:00:48 +0000 2016,Afterwards, go back to your original scene and read it. What adjectives would you use to describe the voice?
782052402711015400,Sat Oct 01 02:59:57 +0000 2016,Pick three that are wildly different. It shouldn't be hard to discern them. The good ones pop. Maybe write a few adjectives re their style.
782052091837554700,Sat Oct 01 02:58:43 +0000 2016,I might even suggest an exercise: take one of your scenes and write it 3x in the voice of three of your favorite screenwriters.

782043532487864300,Sat Oct 01 02:24:42 +0000 2016,But I get the problem: writers want to fit in. They want to be "hireable" and show they understand the form. But if voice suffers...not good
782042928759787500,Sat Oct 01 02:22:18 +0000 2016,Little pisses me off more than a writer who finds a world that fascinates them, but then can't find themselves in it. What a waste.

777063840538243100,Sat Sep 17 08:37:11 +0000 2016,I'm going to wrap up. Next time: why tweeting is bad for your writing career.
777060550131843100,Sat Sep 17 08:24:06 +0000 2016,It's like the Citizen United of the Network TV world, but no one even got to have a court fight about it. It just happened.
777060082328539100,Sat Sep 17 08:22:15 +0000 2016,In many cases, the execs have succeeded in substituting their voices for writers' voices. This is undeniable.

777057860488343600,Sat Sep 17 08:13:25 +0000 2016,I can look at those scripts and say: we wrote what we wanted to write. Whether we succeeded in making a good show, who knows.
777057606548398100,Sat Sep 17 08:12:25 +0000 2016,What it came down to: I wouldn't let them make me write poorly. Whatever mistakes I was going to make, they'd be mine. (And they were).

777053209265266700,Sat Sep 17 07:54:56 +0000 2016,My feeling is always: let them drag my ass up to the level where they get it, so I know where the line is. And then go back to my side.
777052941983240200,Sat Sep 17 07:53:52 +0000 2016,Another (last?) thing re exposition. Because no one tells you if you've hit it too hard, you'll often never know if you've done it poorly.
777052389895344100,Sat Sep 17 07:51:41 +0000 2016,.@evan_gelb Hmm. I'll save that story for my book.
777052166028603400,Sat Sep 17 07:50:47 +0000 2016,So a lot of mid/upper levels haven't had to get better. They just go from job to job, doing a lot of things well, being a good team player.
777051981063950300,Sat Sep 17 07:50:03 +0000 2016,If you're a show runner who rewrite everybody regardless, you don't need Aaron Sorkin. I.e. Aaron Sorkin.
777051783923314700,Sat Sep 17 07:49:16 +0000 2016,These are all serious parts of tv writer job. You may not need them to be brilliant on page if they can restructure Acts 2 &amp; 3 on the board.
777051459930030100,Sat Sep 17 07:47:59 +0000 2016,They get jobs because they're great at breaking story in the room, they're great on set, they manage others well, they'll write the outline.
777051085416505300,Sat Sep 17 07:46:30 +0000 2016,BTW, and this is counterintuitive to all I'm saying... a lot of upper level writers get jobs regardless of how well they write a spec.
777050615260205000,Sat Sep 17 07:44:38 +0000 2016,.@evan_gelb Yeah. I can't even address the marketplace with all this. great scripts don't sell all the time. No excuse not to write one.
777049272457973800,Sat Sep 17 07:39:18 +0000 2016,.@slack2thefuture Yes. A journalist. Who also understood (in his words) every ep was like a front page story in NYT. Tell story worth that.
777048418157928400,Sat Sep 17 07:35:54 +0000 2016,.@evan_gelb Absolutely. It's bad coaching. Maybe they were good players once, but they've spent 5 years on the Cleveland Browns.
777048017165652000,Sat Sep 17 07:34:18 +0000 2016,Bad exposition isn't bad because it gives away too much of the story. It's bad because it creates a crack in your emotional voice.
777047885279920100,Sat Sep 17 07:33:47 +0000 2016,None of this means u need to tell a twisty oblique story. Quite the opposite. Just be pure and emotional in your voice. Be fucking Adele.
777047107974799400,Sat Sep 17 07:30:42 +0000 2016,.@evan_gelb ...if they don't have anything to say &amp; just want to be a writer because it looks fun, tell them not to waste everybody's time.
777046897571663900,Sat Sep 17 07:29:51 +0000 2016,.@evan_gelb Try to really understand what it is they want to say with the script. Help them figure out how to say it...
777046620005216300,Sat Sep 17 07:28:45 +0000 2016,Being a professional is like a marriage, for some people the relationship to $$ improves them, others let themselves go.
777046431672610800,Sat Sep 17 07:28:00 +0000 2016,But part of that is just getting outside yourself as a veteran writer and making an honest assessment of what you've become.
777046189732540400,Sat Sep 17 07:27:03 +0000 2016,...part of that is...they've probably spent more time on their spec than a writer who's working and is writing a spec at night or on hiatus.
777046049164701700,Sat Sep 17 07:26:29 +0000 2016,But be bold. This doesn't just apply to new writers. In fact, new/young writers tend to have more interesting scripts...
777045768360169500,Sat Sep 17 07:25:22 +0000 2016,...but thing long and hard on what the solutions are to those problems, and IF you consider it a problem. Ambiguity is no excuse for lazy...
777045589787672600,Sat Sep 17 07:24:40 +0000 2016,Whoever reads your specs...when they say: I don't get it, I got lost, etc. Do pay attention. It is a communication between you and them...
777044685999120400,Sat Sep 17 07:21:04 +0000 2016,.@movieposteraday Well, we've all had them at one time or another. But maybe substitute another visual item if possible?
777044299154231300,Sat Sep 17 07:19:32 +0000 2016,.@brubaker Yes. I'm not anti-people knowing what the fuck is going on when I want them to know what the fuck is going on.

777043734089175000,Sat Sep 17 07:17:17 +0000 2016,.@brubaker It's become so cliche to say The Wire is the best but The Wire is the best.
777043576664363000,Sat Sep 17 07:16:40 +0000 2016,.@katarnett I had a novelist in my last writers room. The hardest part for her was just being creative with 8 other people yelling.
777043013243588600,Sat Sep 17 07:14:25 +0000 2016,Like magicians, writers know most everybody else's tricks. That's why we get so excited when we see something &amp; we don't know how its done.
777042705469747200,Sat Sep 17 07:13:12 +0000 2016,@Dianthrax I am very pro-rescue dog.
777042497398710300,Sat Sep 17 07:12:22 +0000 2016,.@DillyTante @BittrScrptReadr I won't give any from real show. But I'd just say the overexplaining of dramatic points, especially character.
777042180594470900,Sat Sep 17 07:11:07 +0000 2016,Writing is a craft w/ good/bad practice habits. It is very hard to shift gears if you've written thousands of pages of mediocre tv.
777041292157038600,Sat Sep 17 07:07:35 +0000 2016,.@slack2thefuture Right. And yet, when you rematch the pilot, it's all there. Clear as a fucking bell.
777041144710475800,Sat Sep 17 07:07:00 +0000 2016,Unlike the real world, as a showrunner you'd rather housebreak a puppy than retrain a fucked up rescue dog.
777040692610687000,Sat Sep 17 07:05:12 +0000 2016,It's like there's a particular kind of Creative Stockholm Syndrome afflicting network writers at the Supervising producer level and above.
777040450146271200,Sat Sep 17 07:04:14 +0000 2016,It's like the writers have been hit w/ the clarity hammer so often they've gone twitchy and  just do it w/o being asked to avoid the pain.
777040158663151600,Sat Sep 17 07:03:05 +0000 2016,What kills me is reading spec pilots from experienced writers that are just burdened w/ scenes that feel like they've been dictated by execs
777039648962981900,Sat Sep 17 07:01:03 +0000 2016,Now, I grant this. I am a congenital underwriter. I am brutal about it. So perhaps I've been particularly a target. But I don't think so.
777039190789722100,Sat Sep 17 06:59:14 +0000 2016,When I watch network tv and see the clarity notes, my heart hurts for the writers (and directors/actors). It really does. They are HAMMERED.
777038831358844900,Sat Sep 17 06:57:48 +0000 2016,No one EVER says: Gee, I think you hit that too hard. Maybe you could dial that back for me a bit.
777038696054857700,Sat Sep 17 06:57:16 +0000 2016,There is an INSANE amount of pressure applied to writers (esp. network) to overwrite. The audience being "lost" is the execs #1,2,3 fears.
777038235855786000,Sat Sep 17 06:55:26 +0000 2016,.@cjevy First. If I'm staffing a show I have 150 scripts to read. How many bad first dates get second dates?
777037483217256400,Sat Sep 17 06:52:27 +0000 2016,.@Lexialex It's a hard balance. Too many competing interests. On TSCC we wrote aggressively visual &amp; it didn't always set us up for success.
777036613557727200,Sat Sep 17 06:48:59 +0000 2016,West Wing being one of the great pilots of all time. I couldn't even tell you how much exposition is in there. Doesn't matter.
777036245344018400,Sat Sep 17 06:47:32 +0000 2016,.@MattBlooga Of a great one? Mad Men.
777036054813474800,Sat Sep 17 06:46:46 +0000 2016,.@Zevtsev Most egregious is dialogue. Second place goes to staring at photos. But one can sin in myriad ways.
777035819571744800,Sat Sep 17 06:45:50 +0000 2016,If I'm reading your script and in the first act someone tells the main character something from their personnel file I'm throwing it away.
777035330079776800,Sat Sep 17 06:43:53 +0000 2016,Bad exposition is like bad lighting. It exposes more than it illuminates.
777034815635722200,Sat Sep 17 06:41:51 +0000 2016,.@Zevtsev I'd say network pilots are crippled by exposition. That's as much a studio/network problem as a writer problem. But bad habits.
777034519274586100,Sat Sep 17 06:40:40 +0000 2016,.@Zevtsev Easier then. Behavior, group dynamics. Easier to hide the sleight of hand in a game of three card monte than solitaire.
777034085499740200,Sat Sep 17 06:38:57 +0000 2016,Pilots are generally brutal for exposition. But the best ones...aren't.
777033512985604100,Sat Sep 17 06:36:40 +0000 2016,I read a lot of pilots &amp; the skill with which u can get me involved in the main character is near the top of what I look for.
777032939544588300,Sat Sep 17 06:34:24 +0000 2016,@ErinSatie But I might also like it if Bob was drunk and weird and inappropriate and I didn't know why. that might make me want to know more
777032296633217000,Sat Sep 17 06:31:50 +0000 2016,@ErinSatie But if a person walked up, intro'd themselves &amp; said "Hey, I'm Bob. I'm avenging my dead sister thru drink" I wouldn't like that.
777031852238397400,Sat Sep 17 06:30:04 +0000 2016,@ErinSatie Nope. Context is nice. But a story is the revelation of a mystery.
777031178817642500,Sat Sep 17 06:27:24 +0000 2016,If u tell me the character's most important emotional fact in the first act, just remember that I don't know them and I don't care.

775424662419288000,Mon Sep 12 20:03:40 +0000 2016,@minhalbaig @hayofray...but I do think the people who wanted to write for that probably came from more of a certain POV...
775424503434195000,Mon Sep 12 20:03:02 +0000 2016,@minhalbaig @hayofray ...when a show runners time and energy during staffing is at a premium. I don't think Jill's show was self-selecting..
775424318725460000,Mon Sep 12 20:02:18 +0000 2016,@minhalbaig @hayofray The responsibility ultimately is w/me but I'm talking also wondering how the industry does it as a whole...
775423973454598100,Mon Sep 12 20:00:56 +0000 2016,.@Dyketagnan The problem is experience. U can't judge experience in a room or on a set or in casting by a script. Script is part of package.
775423079279267800,Mon Sep 12 19:57:23 +0000 2016,@philurich Can't look at cancellation until it's staring u in the face.
775422990280372200,Mon Sep 12 19:57:02 +0000 2016,.@hayofray That's where things go wrong. Showrunners don't have that time. Neither do execs. And then u end up with straight white people.
775422426813308900,Mon Sep 12 19:54:47 +0000 2016,.@christinacupo @zeldahallman I think there's many ways into it. But it needs to be thought about from a process POV. TV has much process.
775421794064867300,Mon Sep 12 19:52:17 +0000 2016,.@amandadeibert @zeldahallman But how did you get to sit down with me in the first place so I can ask that coded question?
775421491902951400,Mon Sep 12 19:51:04 +0000 2016,.@christinadirkes I've just written an adaptation of the Snowpiercer movie for TV.
775414803539963900,Mon Sep 12 19:24:30 +0000 2016,.@zeldahallman Thanks for your advice/help!
775414636950593500,Mon Sep 12 19:23:50 +0000 2016,.@cyb3rjunkie Probably not going to be read by a show runner. Too much liability. Too many scripts. Too many gatekeepers.
775414180664844300,Mon Sep 12 19:22:01 +0000 2016,.@zeldahallman Maybe that person writes beautifully, but isn't ready to be out. But it's in the work. What's that convo?
775413754985013200,Mon Sep 12 19:20:20 +0000 2016,.@zeldahallman It's a visibility problem. And what about an LBGTQ writer who maybe isn't out but uses their work to express themselves?
775412249359896600,Mon Sep 12 19:14:21 +0000 2016,.@zeldahallman Correct. that was sort of how i started the thread. Just cuz my intent is LGBTQ-friendly doesn't make it easy or...legal.
775411886489604100,Mon Sep 12 19:12:54 +0000 2016,.@cyb3rjunkie It's difficult. is there a local film/tv community? Contests? Fellowships? It can be frustrating.
775411474021748700,Mon Sep 12 19:11:16 +0000 2016,.@zeldahallman I don't want AN lbgtq writer. I want to find BEST ONES POSSIBLE. Like I do for everybody. Soo...I want to figure out how.
775411189501218800,Mon Sep 12 19:10:08 +0000 2016,.@zeldahallman No prob. It's as much a philosophical q as a practical q, but it's also about casting largest nets to ensure best writers.
775410536297078800,Mon Sep 12 19:07:32 +0000 2016,.@ragnarokundone It's not out of place. I'm not. But I know her. Our kids used to go to the same school!
775409845176442900,Mon Sep 12 19:04:48 +0000 2016,This is how the power structure calcifies, yes? The boys' network NETWORKS. Ad-hoc methods can lead u down bad paths.
775409567513452500,Mon Sep 12 19:03:41 +0000 2016,Hiring a writing staff is half studio lists, half word of mouth. But the studio list is essentially just codified word of mouth.

775408089314893800,Mon Sep 12 18:57:49 +0000 2016,@AThenaAgron ...are taking away from the work. But I think show runners who let fifty people tell them what to write should quit.
775407892438487000,Mon Sep 12 18:57:02 +0000 2016,.@AThenaAgron I think show runners by and large should stay the fuck off of Twitter. I think it's a nice touchstone to see what people...
775407630969823200,Mon Sep 12 18:56:00 +0000 2016,@gretchenatwood @lethodusk thank you very much.
775407545334636500,Mon Sep 12 18:55:39 +0000 2016,.@Sk8j I've done both. But having a relationship with the creator can be complicated.
775407159588683800,Mon Sep 12 18:54:07 +0000 2016,...sometimes I ponder how to codify it in larger, formal structures. Structural discrimination needs structural solutions when possible.
775406887986540500,Mon Sep 12 18:53:03 +0000 2016,Again, lemme be clear: Im not sitting around saying: gosh! I don't know gay people! How would I find some? But for inclusion to be effective
775405909962993700,Mon Sep 12 18:49:09 +0000 2016,@lethodusk @gretchenatwood The reality is MOST writers don't have it. It's tricky for me to get involved w/ unrepped writers I don't know.
775405276635668500,Mon Sep 12 18:46:38 +0000 2016,.@tara_oshea They're all Bear's children. But I loved Sarah's theme. Also, I love how Bear doesn't feel the need to have wall-to-wall music.
775405021156388900,Mon Sep 12 18:45:38 +0000 2016,.@wbc5 Sadly it confirms what I used to tell FBC years ago: fans love watching every ep, rewatching, etc. Can handle serialized complexity.
775404734425378800,Mon Sep 12 18:44:29 +0000 2016,.@gretchenatwood @lethodusk A lot is word of mouth, networking, yes. But larger &amp; more effective writer net cast, the better writers I get.
775404417696698400,Mon Sep 12 18:43:14 +0000 2016,.@gretchenatwood @lethodusk It's trying to build a way which includes the necessary biz steps (agent/studio/network) &amp; gets what I want.
775403130733236200,Mon Sep 12 18:38:07 +0000 2016,.@gretchenatwood @lethodusk I don't worry about it when I sit down w/ them. But I need to read a 100+ scripts to staff a room of &lt;10.
775402823420829700,Mon Sep 12 18:36:54 +0000 2016,.@mrgavinedwards Can we put a sound effect on the Judgment Day flash forwards so we know we're in the future? (Just off top of my head.)
775402241519779800,Mon Sep 12 18:34:35 +0000 2016,@gretchenatwood @lethodusk Agreed. But it's weird, right? What if I was a secret homophobe and was asking q's re people's life re a room?
775400458735063000,Mon Sep 12 18:27:30 +0000 2016,@HLHPattison @brubaker That's a possible, yes. I'm not saying this is impossible by any stretch. it just requires some thought.
775399965828927500,Mon Sep 12 18:25:32 +0000 2016,@lethodusk @gretchenatwood Unsolicited scripts, unrepped writers, all frowned by corp overlords. I use twitter as clarion call and hope?
775399595861880800,Mon Sep 12 18:24:04 +0000 2016,@lethodusk @gretchenatwood I get that in a social media way. But I need to marry that with a more ordered process incl. studios.networks.
775398558987976700,Mon Sep 12 18:19:57 +0000 2016,.@relijahm The truth is, my rooms tend to do pretty well on gender/race/LGBTQ but the first two are easier to ID when staffing.
775398048432201700,Mon Sep 12 18:17:55 +0000 2016,.@rickwiedeman @lethodusk The implication is if I'm writing a show w/ an LGBTQ component I'd be a fucking idiot not to have that POV.
775397717061230600,Mon Sep 12 18:16:36 +0000 2016,.@mrgavinedwards The Wire. And yes. The pilot gets better and better each time. Because the whole season is in there.
775397395685191700,Mon Sep 12 18:15:19 +0000 2016,.@lethodusk But it's tricky, right? Cuz what you're asking me to do is be a Gay Detective &amp; make my own assumptions re who might be LGBTQ.
775396399747768300,Mon Sep 12 18:11:22 +0000 2016,.@lethodusk It's not as simple as saying to list makers "give me your LGBTQ writers." Because a) there isn't one and b) that could be abused
775395968887894000,Mon Sep 12 18:09:39 +0000 2016,.@lethodusk but lets take a step back. Because here's my reality. I need to solicit work. Thru studios, agents, network.
775395326450475000,Mon Sep 12 18:07:06 +0000 2016,It's not my biz what your sexuality is. It shouldn't be. But I want LGBTQ repped in my room. It's important to me.
775394901894639600,Mon Sep 12 18:05:25 +0000 2016,I'll ask a Q of u: If I want an inclusive writers' room including LGBTQ voices, how do I do that w/o delving into people's private lives?

775390552665620500,Mon Sep 12 17:48:08 +0000 2016,.@ShannonXL In a writers room: do they listen to others? Do they only like their own ideas? Can they add to someone else's idea?

775388868413501400,Mon Sep 12 17:41:26 +0000 2016,.@MarcusSanz Hard to get a pitch meeting without an agent. But you have to write great work and show it to as many people you can.
775388671344201700,Mon Sep 12 17:40:39 +0000 2016,.@blakxzep @brubaker That depends on how good the work is. I'm not being flip. More of good is good, more of bad, is...not.
