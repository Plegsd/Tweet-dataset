1176315280739336200,Tue Sep 24 01:59:52 +0000 2019,Yuko's coming.  And she's bringing a map.
1176314216241778700,Tue Sep 24 01:55:38 +0000 2019,Secretly recording Maj. Bowen?  This plan will certainly work out for Amy.
1176313181154635800,Tue Sep 24 01:51:31 +0000 2019,A TWIN?  How would we ever find an actor handsome enough to play @derekzmio's twin?

1176310248736313300,Tue Sep 24 01:39:52 +0000 2019,Not that you can tell, but that was the same nun who took the baby from Yuko in 1918 last episode.
1176309398324437000,Tue Sep 24 01:36:29 +0000 2019,I love @CristinaRodlo in this scene.  It's her first monologue since losing her babies.
1176307891306815500,Tue Sep 24 01:30:30 +0000 2019,Tommy Howell and @chrisnaokilee also did their own stunt here.
1176307452687421400,Tue Sep 24 01:28:46 +0000 2019,I so love C. Thomas Howell in this role.  SO different from the heartthrob we knew and loved in the 80s.
1176306223299170300,Tue Sep 24 01:23:53 +0000 2019,I fear that Apple Watch commercial had a bigger budget than we did.
1176305767533572000,Tue Sep 24 01:22:04 +0000 2019,When jumping into a river, it is advisable to remove your handcuffs first.

1176304753027903500,Tue Sep 24 01:18:02 +0000 2019,I never realized until now that Amy accessorized her hairnet with her bathrobe.
1176303515288785000,Tue Sep 24 01:13:07 +0000 2019,Also, by my count, Chester and Luz have spent exactly one night together...
1176303262544216000,Tue Sep 24 01:12:07 +0000 2019,@HeartMountainWY Heart Mountain Twitter guy, how often did people try to escape from camp?  Rarer than you would expect, I believe.
1176302625311969300,Tue Sep 24 01:09:35 +0000 2019,So even though it's only been four episodes, by my count, Chester and Luz haven't seen each other in almost two years...
1176301076007403500,Tue Sep 24 01:03:25 +0000 2019,That could have easily been a cold open on Six Feet Under.
