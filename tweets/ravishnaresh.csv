783236653716426800,Tue Oct 04 09:25:44 +0000 2016,Dear @AskHelpchat , thank you for giving me thousands of rupees in cashback, even my best friend is not this generous.
782670038339727400,Sun Oct 02 19:54:13 +0000 2016,@Olacabs  Your estimated fare algorithms are completely fucked and unreliable. When you estimate X and charge 2X, it's basically #fraud
782669086874447900,Sun Oct 02 19:50:26 +0000 2016,@ola_supports then why was the estimate fare half??? Had you estimated the fare correctly I wouldn't have done the booking!
782666578210885600,Sun Oct 02 19:40:28 +0000 2016,@ola_supports sure, CRN is 408995769  Estimated fare was around 600, I was charged 1157! #wtf
