19251673565,Thu Jul 22 12:45:34 +0000 2010,@forbes_india thank you very much
19251499648,Thu Jul 22 12:42:40 +0000 2010,simply increasing peoples awareness that they can lead productive lives and contribute is important as well.
19251451184,Thu Jul 22 12:41:53 +0000 2010,we try to highlight. This year, lots of them graduated, one is in journalism, one did accountancy and so on. Money helps always, but...
19251347914,Thu Jul 22 12:40:12 +0000 2010,children with those issues, so we linked up. Everywhere you find the same thing, that a little help can go a long way, so thats what...
19251280836,Thu Jul 22 12:39:05 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I found that kids with cerebral palsy actually played and enjoyed chess and thats how it got started. Vidya Sagar helps....
19251130991,Thu Jul 22 12:36:33 +0000 2010,@forbes_india So finding fun stuff to learn makes me more productive at studying chess
19251073882,Thu Jul 22 12:35:36 +0000 2010,@forbes_india As for concentration, I concentrate better on a problem when its new and exciting rather than the same old stuff....
19251020377,Thu Jul 22 12:34:43 +0000 2010,checking mail I think can apply to executives as well.
19250999616,Thu Jul 22 12:34:21 +0000 2010,and not reading stuff which might distract me. Just immersing myself in chess. Things like not answering the phone for a while or not......
19250866573,Thu Jul 22 12:32:06 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I do as well, but when I work on chess, I strive to block everything else out. Literally, going somewhere secluded....
19250731098,Thu Jul 22 12:29:54 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I would imagine so, though to identify a specific example is trickier.
19250589203,Thu Jul 22 12:27:26 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I would say: relax, its not under your control anyway.
19250372208,Thu Jul 22 12:23:37 +0000 2010,probability of being wrong! I would look around and see what I might have missed and then go with instinct.
19250332354,Thu Jul 22 12:22:55 +0000 2010,@forbes_india that is one of the most difficult questions in chess. Probable is the key word: if I am not sure, then it depends on the.....

19249935279,Thu Jul 22 12:15:57 +0000 2010,@forbes_india Koneru Humpy has crossed 2600 and I think Harika is good as well. Saranya and Mahalakshmi also are quite promising.
19249797037,Thu Jul 22 12:13:31 +0000 2010,as well and I think thats why their results are slowly improving. Still, it would be something if another woman broke into the top 10.
19249750749,Thu Jul 22 12:12:42 +0000 2010,@forbes_india i think its fine that we have a womens world championship cycle and rankings. However, lots of them play in mixed events...
19249584017,Thu Jul 22 12:09:49 +0000 2010,@forbes_india they have. I think their lower levels of participation are responsible. As more of them play, they are getting better.
19249530150,Thu Jul 22 12:08:50 +0000 2010,@forbes_india a tricky question. it stands to reason that women should not lag behind too much in chess, but except for Judit Polgar....
19249372706,Thu Jul 22 12:05:59 +0000 2010,@forbes_india sure go ahead
19249272994,Thu Jul 22 12:04:10 +0000 2010,@forbes_india hmmm, I dont mind, but I guess it would be cool to have an opening named after me. Maybe I should work on one!
19249015480,Thu Jul 22 11:59:43 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I have always enjoyed the Slav defence and the Sicilian defence. However, most of the best lines have been taken already!
19248754989,Thu Jul 22 11:54:49 +0000 2010,@forbes_india black doesnt even play for equality and aims for something unbalanced to maximise winning chances
19248721380,Thu Jul 22 11:54:10 +0000 2010,@forbes_india when your pieces are well placed and you dont see any plan for your opponent that worries you. of course, sometimes....
19248576209,Thu Jul 22 11:51:21 +0000 2010,@forbes_india yes absolutely children will take to chess themselves, but it should never be imposed.
19248395149,Thu Jul 22 11:47:52 +0000 2010,slowly become curious and if it captures their imagination, thats the main thing.
19248363174,Thu Jul 22 11:47:14 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I think the child can be introduced to the game as early as 3 or 4. As they become comfortable with the pieces they will...
19248244831,Thu Jul 22 11:44:57 +0000 2010,@forbes_india exactly, most worrying is wasted energy
19248140333,Thu Jul 22 11:42:53 +0000 2010,@forbes_india that nothing at the board matches up to the worries before a game!
19247998289,Thu Jul 22 11:40:04 +0000 2010,@forbes_india gave me a big lead in regaining my title. Also, right now, my final game with Topalov is rather fresh in my head
19247939815,Thu Jul 22 11:38:55 +0000 2010,@forbes_india that is a very tough one to pick. I like my first round win with Lautier in Biel 1997, my win with Morozevich in Mexico.....
19247691006,Thu Jul 22 11:33:54 +0000 2010,@forbes_india so you have new challenges to face, but it would have been fun to play him again
19247653691,Thu Jul 22 11:33:10 +0000 2010,@forbes_india and every year, someone else comes along....Aronian, Carlsen, Karjakin and so on
19247606795,Thu Jul 22 11:32:13 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I thought about it, but life is relentless. within a few months, it was obvious that Topalov had improved a lot
19247459786,Thu Jul 22 11:29:20 +0000 2010,@forbes_india that would depend on the island rules but with him at least I can practise my Spanish
19247339421,Thu Jul 22 11:26:51 +0000 2010,@forbes_india if there is one, I would say the knight but i will play the position I have!
19247193527,Thu Jul 22 11:23:53 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I think even now I have to remind myself that at the board you have to be confident
19247134855,Thu Jul 22 11:22:38 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I think confidence ebbs and flows. As I got better, I simply had issues with different players. I mainly worked on my chess
19247022546,Thu Jul 22 11:20:17 +0000 2010,@forbes_india sure
19246926004,Thu Jul 22 11:18:16 +0000 2010,@forbes_india it is a stereotype though. most chess players are pretty easy going except at the board
19246899282,Thu Jul 22 11:17:43 +0000 2010,@forbes_india on the contrary it was harder to deal with the pressure of not conforming! Finally I just became comfortable in my own skin
19246707711,Thu Jul 22 11:13:42 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I can only think about Russia as an example I think its due to their system of talent-spotting and coaching
19246653925,Thu Jul 22 11:12:33 +0000 2010,@forbes_india also, one can learn these skills by working with the right people, so willingness to learn is the main thing
19246627137,Thu Jul 22 11:11:59 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I had my years when I drifted and had fun, but eventually I understood that to become world champion I had to get serious
19246582820,Thu Jul 22 11:11:03 +0000 2010,@forbes_india I think its wrong to generalize about nations, esp. in something so individualistic like chess
19246410544,Thu Jul 22 11:07:25 +0000 2010,@forbes_india Its not a big deal, I feel the same, just entering your age in places surprises you!
19246327331,Thu Jul 22 11:05:38 +0000 2010,@forbes_india sure lets go!
19246241950,Thu Jul 22 11:03:51 +0000 2010,@forbes_india hello everyone thank you very much.
