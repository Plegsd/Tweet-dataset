451180316800348160,Wed Apr 02 02:12:24 +0000 2014,Also the film was almost entirely handheld. I spent every night in the editing room after shooting and reshot things I felt unsatisfying.
451179932069412860,Wed Apr 02 02:10:52 +0000 2014,No playback makes you more in tune with your instincts. It's terrifying. You can never use the editor in your head.
451179114041708540,Wed Apr 02 02:07:37 +0000 2014,Playback was invented by Jerry Lewis (This is not an April Fool's thing) so he could direct himself.
451178892389523460,Wed Apr 02 02:06:45 +0000 2014,Had no playback which is something I wanted to do for a long time. This means once I shot it, I couldn't look back to see how I did.

434322401526968300,Fri Feb 14 13:45:04 +0000 2014,The cast is sensational. The performances were so captivating. I was walking on air as I went home. I hope I don't screw this up.
434320094290649100,Fri Feb 14 13:35:54 +0000 2014,There were three people there who hadn't read the script and read smaller parts. They literally jumped out of their seats.

256448038619467780,Thu Oct 11 17:35:51 +0000 2012,So I saw this documentary that wrecked me. It's called The Artist is Present. I have a new artistic guru. Her name is Marina Abramovic.

254745771688218620,Sun Oct 07 00:51:39 +0000 2012,Luke in the editing department carved this pumpkin on the last film. I can't wait to see what he does on #AfterEarth. http://t.co/rK75ZItF
254039994199584770,Fri Oct 05 02:07:09 +0000 2012,Great editing demands you being present. Being aware of your reaction, not the intended reaction.
254038377584799740,Fri Oct 05 02:00:43 +0000 2012,Editing is a moving target. You make changes. Watch it. The film and all the scenes have altered in impact. You make more changes.
252586935032365060,Mon Oct 01 01:53:12 +0000 2012,The documentary paralleling his life and HItler's life is completely fascinating and remarkable. I had no idea Hitler was a failed artist.
252586501521670140,Mon Oct 01 01:51:29 +0000 2012,This was also Chaplin's first talkie. He risked everything. At this time he was also the most beloved person on the planet.
252586217223372800,Mon Oct 01 01:50:21 +0000 2012,Chaplin made The Great Dictator making fun of Hitler and making a resounding plea for freedom before the U.S. entered the war.
252585780311097340,Mon Oct 01 01:48:37 +0000 2012,Watched Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator. Mind blowing what this man risked to make this film. Filled with me conviction and courage.
252142548418703360,Sat Sep 29 20:27:22 +0000 2012,BTW I've been shy about telling you this, but I'm writing a book on Education Reform.  I know your reaction is "What?!"

252049063309082620,Sat Sep 29 14:15:54 +0000 2012,As part of my research I went to a school in Newark New Jersey, named North Star Academy. This was on Thursday morning.
252048596701163520,Sat Sep 29 14:14:02 +0000 2012,The book is being published by Simon and Schuster next year.

252047301013549060,Sat Sep 29 14:08:54 +0000 2012,Our emotional IQ is higher than our academic IQ so we defer to that.
252046817947176960,Sat Sep 29 14:06:58 +0000 2012,I think we use a critical thinking part of our brain in the editing room and then do purely primal emotional viewing in a theater.
252046363364298750,Sat Sep 29 14:05:10 +0000 2012,A lot of the changes we are absolutely sure are improvements in the editing room, when viewed in a theater in a long run, are just misses.
252046089832771600,Sat Sep 29 14:04:05 +0000 2012,These changes are so subtle and have such a cumulative impact, you have to keep screening the film in large chunks to see what worked.
