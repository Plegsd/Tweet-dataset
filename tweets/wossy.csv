600945108847059000,Wed May 20 08:44:13 +0000 2015,@mrmarkmillar @blankpage76 one of the reasons I wish artists still worked on paper. Digital will kill this kind of creation I fear.

600944662082363400,Wed May 20 08:42:27 +0000 2015,@mrmarkmillar well he used to save a lot of the actual creating for the inking stage. His pencils were often not that tight.
600943809455853600,Wed May 20 08:39:03 +0000 2015,@mrmarkmillar fascinating. Clowes is a stiff artist though like Wood. Woods inks on Ditko were nice. Steve need the help in later years.
600943371025256400,Wed May 20 08:37:19 +0000 2015,@mrmarkmillar I'd agree, inc. Adams. Miller improved by Janson, Rogers improved by Austin. Wrightson always diminished except by Kaluta

600940589652258800,Wed May 20 08:26:16 +0000 2015,@mrmarkmillar no but I'll have a think. Colan diminished by everyone except Palmer. Everyone diminished by Colletta, obviously
600935208343441400,Wed May 20 08:04:53 +0000 2015,@mrmarkmillar every film should be set in 1973
