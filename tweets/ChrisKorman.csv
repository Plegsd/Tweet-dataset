826138935894106100,Mon Jan 30 18:44:05 +0000 2017,2. The NRA and the politicians it controls oppose any measure meant to implement added vetting of would-be gun buyers.

695706790055415800,Fri Feb 05 20:33:19 +0000 2016,@REALCHRISSMITHs I'll take a look when I get some time. Football deaths over the last few years have been higher than normal.

695702772767813600,Fri Feb 05 20:17:21 +0000 2016,Goodell sees early retirement of Calvin Johnson (and a few others) as personal decision, not part of a trend related to injury worries.

695700342311297000,Fri Feb 05 20:07:41 +0000 2016,Question: Have fewer full-contact practices led to diminished play in NFL? Goodell: Play has never been better.
