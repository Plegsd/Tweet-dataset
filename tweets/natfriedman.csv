801501340924903400,Wed Nov 23 19:03:05 +0000 2016,@mjg59 @snorp I think it's an impractical standard.  E.g. CoreOS license should be changed to not allow use by Trump voters.

801498417012691000,Wed Nov 23 18:51:28 +0000 2016,@mjg59 I think it's a massive misallocation of your energy to attack allies who spent millions to try to avoid this outcome
