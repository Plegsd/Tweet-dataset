659842964257046500,Thu Oct 29 21:23:16 +0000 2015,@Rhialto Yes, it's called Whimsyshire in the original Diablo III, and requires a Staff of Herding to enter.
659842713672548400,Thu Oct 29 21:22:16 +0000 2015,@byRheZ Good find! Sometimes those goblins forget to close the portal to home, and then you can explore the Vault for yourself. :D
659842360243720200,Thu Oct 29 21:20:52 +0000 2015,@copyofcopyofcop It's Queen Asylla. She was King Leoric's wife until he had her beheaded.
659842193633337300,Thu Oct 29 21:20:12 +0000 2015,@Ravenpenny Yep! It's Halloween, and we wanted to celebrate.
659841882839580700,Thu Oct 29 21:18:58 +0000 2015,@Varcyon Nothing secret, just a way to gauge the Queen's thoughts on how good of a house is that she's Trick or Treating at.
659841427271123000,Thu Oct 29 21:17:10 +0000 2015,@ricthot :D Good luck and have fun!

659837262931353600,Thu Oct 29 21:00:37 +0000 2015,@healoe Adorable! Have fun and happy gaming!
659837047507578900,Thu Oct 29 20:59:45 +0000 2015,@MicahPSAB Nothing in-game is planned for Halloween. Typically we announce in-game events on the website. :)
659836687694991400,Thu Oct 29 20:58:20 +0000 2015,@WilliamNordberg  There's a bug with it, but it  should correct it on its own. Give it a few games and it should fix itself.
659835807243481100,Thu Oct 29 20:54:50 +0000 2015,@ChrisWahl It's real.

659832474474713100,Thu Oct 29 20:41:35 +0000 2015,This is possibly the craziest place in all of Sanctuary to go Trick or Treating, but the cupcakes are worth it. https://t.co/R57Z92K6ZV

659354002681786400,Wed Oct 28 13:00:19 +0000 2015,Wortham is normally a good place to Trick or Treat, but Asylla should probably come back when it's not on fire. https://t.co/qmf9a01Yn0
659148822392668200,Tue Oct 27 23:25:00 +0000 2015,Queen Asylla knocked, stayed, and listened at Deckard's house while Trick or Treating, but no one was home. https://t.co/NtpLR9lzOh

659121284295454700,Tue Oct 27 21:35:34 +0000 2015,@QueenOfAlts I agree. I look at your Witch Doctor and see nothing but soul reaping tools of the trade.

659106899925667800,Tue Oct 27 20:38:25 +0000 2015,@JLSigman @lotro That's not so bad. Playing games when the chores are done feels pretty good, too. Have fun out there!

658752230376493000,Mon Oct 26 21:09:05 +0000 2015,@SadlerHeat That's Old Tristram. Queen Asylla thought she'd go trick or treating, but that place doesn't look too promising.

647074883315216400,Thu Sep 24 15:47:28 +0000 2015,@ShinUK82 There's no good way to farm it. It's a random drop, so playing Adventure Mode and doing Bounties or  Nephalem Rifts is the best.
647074471879139300,Thu Sep 24 15:45:50 +0000 2015,@Miierin They're all pretty good, so going with what sounds cool to you is really the best choice. Magic Missile your heart away!

638471790860173300,Mon Aug 31 22:01:51 +0000 2015,@BL4CK0UT_30 We use a variety of formats for dev interviews. We haven't done a Reddit Q&amp;A in a while, and we felt it was time for one! :)

638465801993891800,Mon Aug 31 21:38:03 +0000 2015,@OneAngryChemist I remember saying something like that once. It's been over 3 years now, and they haven't stopped. O.o

638463652333416400,Mon Aug 31 21:29:31 +0000 2015,@ChamsiinDK How funny! The names are randomized, but that alone makes for some hilarious combos.
638463325492277200,Mon Aug 31 21:28:13 +0000 2015,@williamstarkid Chiltara is definitely the roughest part of acquiring a Staff of Herding. Good luck, William!

638436645902024700,Mon Aug 31 19:42:12 +0000 2015,@SpartanWolfPlay @JeffKlok_ It'll probably need to be a bigger boat. On the plus side of that, you can afford it. Happy gaming!
638436446773248000,Mon Aug 31 19:41:25 +0000 2015,@Zelse007 @Warcraft @Elvinelol Somehow I believe this victory will be short lived.

638429900148379600,Mon Aug 31 19:15:24 +0000 2015,@Nanzanxo Some externally influenced deaths in D3 are totally worth it. Cute is certainly a factor in that equation.
