71076802763821060,Thu May 19 04:56:44 +0000 2011,@Johnny_Joints I think the Lakers problems have to do with lack of speed. Those problems are usually easy to fix. Size and scoring are there
71006293984415740,Thu May 19 00:16:34 +0000 2011,@Smart_Suzie I don't think at this point this can be rectified as this is the first time I have ever made my feelings public. Moving on.

71001057064525820,Wed May 18 23:55:45 +0000 2011,@heyAndrew What prompted me has been a steady diet of disrespect from the supposedly wonderful Laker family. see Sporting News for the story
71000134930006020,Wed May 18 23:52:05 +0000 2011,@MovieViral A slight is a slight. There is no bitterness. Laker fans have always let me know that they appreciated me. That is sufficient.

13769605452,Tue May 11 04:32:15 +0000 2010,When I played against the Jazz they took us to 7 games in '88 but we won so I'm glad to see them still trailing behind the Lakers ..lol
13769534360,Tue May 11 04:30:36 +0000 2010,Fish just got fouled - if he puts down his free throws it will be right in the face of all the cheap shot Jazz fans
13769480152,Tue May 11 04:29:24 +0000 2010,thanks everyone for telling me about Twitvid.. I will be trying it out this week
13769215675,Tue May 11 04:22:55 +0000 2010,re tweet:The Lakers have to keep the crowd out of the game. A 4 to 8 point run will quiet them  & stomp on the neck of the Jazz
13769161753,Tue May 11 04:21:38 +0000 2010,The Lakers have to keep the crowd out of the game because a 4 to 8 point run will quiet them down & put a foot on the neck of the Jazz team
13769084356,Tue May 11 04:19:51 +0000 2010,@kalalwan I think its inevitable. The Palestinians & Israelis have to find a way to communicate & live in peace.
13769032766,Tue May 11 04:18:39 +0000 2010,@Kelvaan I think Dwight had a go to move that didn't require him dunking it would save him alot of wear & tear

13768651593,Tue May 11 04:09:44 +0000 2010,In case any of you need a new Ford truck I saw a good contest to win one while helping some kids of our fallen soldiers
13768580163,Tue May 11 04:08:07 +0000 2010,I just saw Charles Barkley answer a fan live on tv - does anyone know how to do that on Twitter? I thought it was quite entertaining.
13768530629,Tue May 11 04:06:59 +0000 2010,@TheBlender23 I think Phoenix will have the same problem as the Jazz in that they can't match the Lakers size in the paint
13768420286,Tue May 11 04:04:36 +0000 2010,Everybody that has family members in the military are part of the glue that keeps our nation together. Hats off to all of them.
13768304693,Tue May 11 04:02:07 +0000 2010,@TylerDurton Showtime vs. The Current Squad: Kobe gives any team a shot but the Showtime Team & Bench were superlative.. My vote is Showtime
13768228894,Tue May 11 04:00:34 +0000 2010,@FritzPingol the low lifes in the stands that made reference to Dereks daughter's eye have about as much class as snot on a doornob!
13768057588,Tue May 11 03:56:56 +0000 2010,how many military families do we have out there tonight? I've been thinking of you all how much you have given for us all.
13768018301,Tue May 11 03:56:05 +0000 2010,@jacenallen my health is doing good. I am in remission and glad to still be here....
13767905922,Tue May 11 03:53:36 +0000 2010,Jazz can't guard Pau in the post and Kobe on the outside simultaneously. The crowd looks like they are watching a funeral.
13767657556,Tue May 11 03:48:15 +0000 2010,glad to see my Twitter fans are watching the game with me
13767603401,Tue May 11 03:47:05 +0000 2010,Shannon Brown has played very good off of the bench along w the rest of the Lakers bench players
13767587061,Tue May 11 03:46:44 +0000 2010,its the best Andrew can do playing hurt
13767572021,Tue May 11 03:46:25 +0000 2010,Andrew is coming in for short periods of time & having a positive effect
13767529285,Tue May 11 03:45:31 +0000 2010,The longer this round goes on the greater advantage the Lakers will have
13767468340,Tue May 11 03:44:15 +0000 2010,Utah does not have the horses to get it done tonight. They are turning over the ball to much. I doubt they can take 4 straight
13767003778,Tue May 11 03:34:37 +0000 2010,Lakers were very well prepared for this game -they are having a great defensive effort & their bench is doing a great job so far
13766977264,Tue May 11 03:34:05 +0000 2010,Its Cap and I'm back to give you some play by plays tonight's game during the second half. I'll start a few off during the 2nd Quarter ..
12717892267,Fri Apr 23 18:36:26 +0000 2010,I would expect the Lakers to win the first round. But they won't be able to put Oklahoma away until they start using their smarts..
12717859446,Fri Apr 23 18:35:41 +0000 2010,The Lakers can succeed if they use their smarts & experience to overcome Oklahomas youth & enthusiasm
12717784394,Fri Apr 23 18:34:02 +0000 2010,as he tries to overcome being double & tripled teamed. Oklahoma is focusing their defensive game on keeping the ball away from Pau & Andrew
12717740355,Fri Apr 23 18:33:04 +0000 2010,Last nights game shows what happens when the Lakers revert to bad habits. The team does not do well when they stand around & watch Kobe

10730396900,Fri Mar 19 16:33:02 +0000 2010,http://www.paniniamerica.net/videos.cfm?vid=181 I guess Kobe got one of my cards in his pack!
10657340319,Thu Mar 18 05:21:32 +0000 2010,& this can translate into a team commitment to put their best effort on the court every night.Andrew Bynum has been putting up great numbers
10657302653,Thu Mar 18 05:20:17 +0000 2010,The Lakers can fortunately gain their championship stride in a relatively easy manner. Each player must re-dedicate himself as an individual
10657258236,Thu Mar 18 05:18:50 +0000 2010,that its a long season (82) games and its difficult to maintain the Championship focus for many players.
10657228883,Thu Mar 18 05:17:54 +0000 2010,I'm sure that fans that follow the Lakers are concerned about the inconsistency's in their performances. This is probably due to the fact...
10534345717,Mon Mar 15 20:47:42 +0000 2010,I will always think of Peter G when I repeat the lines "We have clearance, Clarence".  I send my condolences to his family & friends. KAJ33

9796959435,Sun Feb 28 23:06:07 +0000 2010,Smith just shot the Nuggets out of the game
9796867457,Sun Feb 28 23:04:12 +0000 2010,@JeffAntoine we all know that the refs don't always get it right but that doesn't take away from Artest doing a great job
9796731266,Sun Feb 28 23:01:34 +0000 2010,Ron Artests defensive pressure finally got to Mello. Good job Ron!
9796679223,Sun Feb 28 23:00:37 +0000 2010,@DJBiggcheeez Pau plays the game in a way that make sense to Pau & it has been very effective so I don't criticize him
9796431352,Sun Feb 28 22:56:14 +0000 2010,@ChrisNOLADC point very well made
9796208174,Sun Feb 28 22:52:51 +0000 2010,@KI6BJV true but in the context of the NBA there seems to be a correlation
9796175683,Sun Feb 28 22:52:04 +0000 2010,@Ballerstweets I visited Chile in the early 1990's & the people there are very gracious & hospitable & I hope they recover soon
9796124770,Sun Feb 28 22:50:49 +0000 2010,I think people w macho tattoos are trying to make a statement. Its not like everyone in the NBA has been in the Navy..
9796074494,Sun Feb 28 22:49:35 +0000 2010,@NubianSage no need to apologize but whose winning the hockey game anyway?
9796035419,Sun Feb 28 22:48:39 +0000 2010,@Belliwi Lakers vs. Denver right now
9795997440,Sun Feb 28 22:47:45 +0000 2010,I think Pau not having tattoos is an expression of his confidence in his game in that he doesn't need 2 affirm his dominance w macho tattoos
9795891564,Sun Feb 28 22:45:17 +0000 2010,@chuckiebtoo The Defense makes the difference

9795624630,Sun Feb 28 22:39:23 +0000 2010,Mellos poor shooting is a direct result of Ron Artests defensive efforts in this game
9795563938,Sun Feb 28 22:38:02 +0000 2010,@soulz2003 He might have a chance but we have to wait to see how the end of the season plays out
9795504736,Sun Feb 28 22:36:44 +0000 2010,@pixxie13a I'm watching basketball today
9795412992,Sun Feb 28 22:34:47 +0000 2010,Lakers have closed the gap by creating turnovers this quarter. If they can continue to defend this well they will have a great chance to win
9795363193,Sun Feb 28 22:33:47 +0000 2010,@JayDel32 whoever is open on the Lakers has to have the confidence to take the shot - Kobe is getting doubled teamed
9795100055,Sun Feb 28 22:29:16 +0000 2010,Lakers D is making a difference -
9795047005,Sun Feb 28 22:28:36 +0000 2010,Carmelo looks like a sharp shooter
9795011359,Sun Feb 28 22:27:51 +0000 2010,Artest is having a great defensive game guarding Mello
9794958887,Sun Feb 28 22:26:35 +0000 2010,The Lakers need to be patient & work the ball inside where there size will make a difference
9794925445,Sun Feb 28 22:25:46 +0000 2010,The Lakers are making good defensive plays these past couple of times down the court
9794860340,Sun Feb 28 22:24:09 +0000 2010,What I just said was simple but knowing it and executing it are two different things.
9794837455,Sun Feb 28 22:23:34 +0000 2010,Lakers need to get a good shot everytime down court & then play  tough defense at the other end
9794804522,Sun Feb 28 22:22:43 +0000 2010,@fivepizme just needed a break for a while as I was dealing lots of other stuff
9794679678,Sun Feb 28 22:19:35 +0000 2010,@Scootch1 Coach Donohue was a very serious Celtics fan & he always challenged us to have the ball find the open man when I was in HS
9794642053,Sun Feb 28 22:18:38 +0000 2010,@lizzfilms I just spoke at the Cleveland Public Library  today. I;m heading to New Orleans next
9794611094,Sun Feb 28 22:17:51 +0000 2010,Bynum needs to pay attention to what's going on. The challenge for him is to understand what is happening on all parts of the court
9794565001,Sun Feb 28 22:16:39 +0000 2010,Carmelo  Anthony is one of the most consistent scorers in todays game & I enjoy watching him rise to the challenge every night

9794267197,Sun Feb 28 22:08:54 +0000 2010,@rammerjammer74 my thought is that its too early to know what the post season will look like
9794110028,Sun Feb 28 22:04:51 +0000 2010,@GAVETH23 Bynums health is more a question of him staying in shape & staying away from those awkward situations where he has gotten injured
9794064323,Sun Feb 28 22:03:42 +0000 2010,@Ktwit23 right now I am trying to focus on making my documentary
9794039622,Sun Feb 28 22:03:05 +0000 2010,@JoshWidmer When the Lakers don't have Kobe they are not as predictable as they r w/Kobe. That makes it more difficult 2 defend against them
9793992123,Sun Feb 28 22:01:54 +0000 2010,@DaveAkaSuper Denver, San Antonio & Portland all have very good teams & they all would like to beat the Lakers
9793924103,Sun Feb 28 22:00:15 +0000 2010,@theesweet23 I think Lakers have the  talent 2 beat the Nuggets. But the Nuggets are hungry & determined & that determination can overcome

9793728870,Sun Feb 28 21:55:11 +0000 2010,If the Lakers focus & commitment rises to the level of their talent they have a very good chance of doing very well in the post season.
9793682918,Sun Feb 28 21:54:00 +0000 2010,The Lakers may b still thinking of last years success rather than focusing on their goals for this year.
9793614907,Sun Feb 28 21:52:11 +0000 2010,@Vujachick the Lakers do not seem to play w a killer instinct on a steady basis.
9793559504,Sun Feb 28 21:50:45 +0000 2010,Andrew Bynum is doing well and he has worked hard to learn to what he needs to learn to contribute to his team.

4334284086,Thu Sep 24 04:11:26 +0000 2009,@JackWIII my point is THAT Limbaugh is incorrect. He injected race into this
4334212362,Thu Sep 24 04:07:35 +0000 2009,The reason I am speaking out against #Limbaugh is because concerned Americans should confront racist demagoguery from any source. KAJ33

4333951675,Thu Sep 24 03:54:22 +0000 2009,Mr. Limbaugh has nostalgia for a time when whites would win every encounter with non-whites. The laws that made possible no longer exist.
4323152205,Wed Sep 23 19:34:41 +0000 2009,I'm filming On the Shoulders @ the Armory in NYC .  I'll be out of pocket till tonight but then I will be back with more comments.
4323095133,Wed Sep 23 19:32:03 +0000 2009,We all agree the incident was ugly but it had no racial context. There was no chorus of black voices saying right on.. as Limbaugh stated
4311363940,Wed Sep 23 08:34:12 +0000 2009,http://bit.ly/2FPWxX
4311108943,Wed Sep 23 08:10:41 +0000 2009,Why do you think Mr. Limbaugh has to blame this incident on issues of race? Lets start a discussion on this. I need to understand this.
4311094208,Wed Sep 23 08:09:23 +0000 2009,Racial animosity was not the cause of the incident and I resent Mr. Limbaugh's laying the blame on President Obama.
4311055515,Wed Sep 23 08:05:52 +0000 2009,Mr. Limbaugh feels that white kids are getting beat up because Obama is President & made the statement that this is Barack Obama's America
4311041594,Wed Sep 23 08:04:41 +0000 2009,Due 2 the fact that the aggressor was black & the other kid seemed 2 have no skill in defending himself Rush Limbaugh makes an absurd remark

2542431888,Thu Jul 09 01:18:18 +0000 2009,Ariza wanted "star money" now but he's only 23 &  hasn't shown consistency year in and year out.
2542395617,Thu Jul 09 01:15:44 +0000 2009,If #Artest can handle his emotional issues he will be a great addition to the team.
2542387507,Thu Jul 09 01:15:09 +0000 2009,I thought #Ariza was quick & stealthy and did amazing things & I'll miss him on the team
2542378664,Thu Jul 09 01:14:31 +0000 2009,Artest is a formidable front line player but he is emotionally erratic so we'll see what happens.
2542330931,Thu Jul 09 01:10:59 +0000 2009,Ariza was trying 2 get more money because this was his first outstanding year. Artest was willing to sign for the money Ariza turned down
2542249729,Thu Jul 09 01:05:00 +0000 2009,my summer reading:The Biography of Satchel Paige- its very intstng because he pitched during the Harlem Renaissance & became a star athlete
2542205505,Thu Jul 09 01:01:50 +0000 2009,Signing #Artest was a thumb in the eye of Trevor Ariza because Artest signed for the same amount of money that they offered to #Ariza.
