921405446090514400,Fri Oct 20 15:59:11 +0000 2017,@sheriffjackson What makes Serverless attractive is the ability to ignore that layer of the stack; especially in the Cloud.
921403279778525200,Fri Oct 20 15:50:35 +0000 2017,I can't wait until Serverless expands beyond JavaScript and Python. Until then I'll be resorting to hacks like this: https://t.co/U8dvrcmLVC

918702516732289000,Fri Oct 13 04:58:43 +0000 2017,The silent conversation was interrupted by the horns from the drivers behind waiting to pass. We parted ways as better people.
918702032709496800,Fri Oct 13 04:56:47 +0000 2017,"I never thought of it that way.", he said, as he wiped away the tear.
918701901423689700,Fri Oct 13 04:56:16 +0000 2017,My eyes started to water, both of us were to macho to cry, but embraced the moment as a sign of mutual respect.
918701800546377700,Fri Oct 13 04:55:52 +0000 2017,As he slowly turned towards me, he removed his glasses now wet from the single tear trapped underneath.
918701653095678000,Fri Oct 13 04:55:17 +0000 2017,We're at the entrance now, but I'm still in the car. Another few moments would pass before the driver turned around.
918701543641071600,Fri Oct 13 04:54:51 +0000 2017,"They got your attention, now ask yourself: are you more upset about the style of protest or the issue being protested", I continued.
918701437109993500,Fri Oct 13 04:54:25 +0000 2017,I asked him: "Think about it, what good is a protest if it does not get people's attention?". He took pause.
918701289042669600,Fri Oct 13 04:53:50 +0000 2017,We're at the airport now but there's a bit of traffic between us and my terminal; just enough time for closing remarks.
918701173925855200,Fri Oct 13 04:53:23 +0000 2017,Strong words, but we're not arguing. We took turns making our points and sharing our perspectives.
918701081042894800,Fri Oct 13 04:53:01 +0000 2017,"It's called a protest", I replied. "No, they are disrespecting the flag, and our country. It just makes me mad as hell", he interjected.
918700959257149400,Fri Oct 13 04:52:31 +0000 2017,At this point I realized I've yet to have this debate out loud. I was not prepared. But somehow I found the right words.
918700826935246800,Fri Oct 13 04:52:00 +0000 2017,I could see his eyes in the rearview mirror eagerly awaiting my response.
918700735956521000,Fri Oct 13 04:51:38 +0000 2017,My first thought was to be like: "Excuse me?", and then proceed to tell him why he was wrong, but I chose a different route.
918700614414090200,Fri Oct 13 04:51:09 +0000 2017,He had a deep anger in his face. This was pent up emotion which he decided to set free.
918700533233238000,Fri Oct 13 04:50:50 +0000 2017,"What do you think about all these black NFL players disrespecting the flag?". Yeah he went there.
918700414073049100,Fri Oct 13 04:50:22 +0000 2017,Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing, where the hell is this going? And yeah, I'm still out of walking distance from the airport.
918700259638853600,Fri Oct 13 04:49:45 +0000 2017,"You seem like a smart guy", he said. "You're a young black man who seems to have his head on straight"
918700111961530400,Fri Oct 13 04:49:09 +0000 2017,We're 30 minutes into the conversation; I had some how passed his test. He let his guard down, and took the conversation in a new direction.
918699976103927800,Fri Oct 13 04:48:37 +0000 2017,In many ways I feel like I'm representing all black people and this one conversation would have way more impact than it should.
918699757085777900,Fri Oct 13 04:47:45 +0000 2017,This is the point where I get really conscious about how I speak. I go out of my way to avoid confirming any negative stereotypes.
918699677448519700,Fri Oct 13 04:47:26 +0000 2017,"So what do you do for Google?", he asked.
918699590542532600,Fri Oct 13 04:47:05 +0000 2017,We were different in almost every way. He was tall with a slender frame and reminded me of my uncle; only difference, this guy was white.
918699492467023900,Fri Oct 13 04:46:42 +0000 2017,I grabbed a quick glance at my phone hoping to gain some insight into the person I was talking too.
918699422547984400,Fri Oct 13 04:46:25 +0000 2017,This was his way of breaking the ice.
918699347448971300,Fri Oct 13 04:46:07 +0000 2017,We slowly pulled out of the parking lot. He lowered the music. "So you must work for Google?". I think the t-shirt gave it away.
918699259687342100,Fri Oct 13 04:45:46 +0000 2017,"Where you going?", the driver asked. "To the airport", I responded. I was in for a 45 minute ride; maybe an hour with traffic.
918699130028900400,Fri Oct 13 04:45:15 +0000 2017,He picked me up from the Google campus. I was wearing my Google t-shirt with my work badge in plain sight.
