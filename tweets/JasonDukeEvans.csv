921092745854439400,Thu Oct 19 19:16:38 +0000 2017,6) I love what @voxdotcom said about #TheSnowman "the most transcendently awful movie of 2017, and this is the year I saw The Emoji Movie."
921092324544917500,Thu Oct 19 19:14:57 +0000 2017,5) One clue in #TheSnowman is that the killer strikes when it snows. But movie is set in Norway?! That's like killing when it is sunny in FL

921090885470867500,Thu Oct 19 19:09:14 +0000 2017,3) It had none of the charm or humor of Girl With Dragon Tattoo. "Wait, that had no charm or humor!" Now you know how depressing Snowman is
921090211764998100,Thu Oct 19 19:06:34 +0000 2017,2) Also, there's no way police can figure out next victim. All the targets are women in bad relationships. That narrows things NOT AT ALL!
921089670066442200,Thu Oct 19 19:04:25 +0000 2017,1) #TheSnowman's marketing campaign pretends like the police are being taunted with clues... but there are no clues. https://t.co/5TllGv4gVh

887384476090867700,Tue Jul 18 18:52:00 +0000 2017,3) Nolan made a movie about #Dunkirk that doesn't include a single German or any British politician/general. No perspective on what it meant
887384153351651300,Tue Jul 18 18:50:43 +0000 2017,2) If Nolan had shown me what happened to Murphy to change him, that would have been a great film. Instead, he's just a coward for no reason

871464841034313700,Sun Jun 04 20:33:03 +0000 2017,20) Props to DCEU for FINALLY making a good comic book movie (Nolan's Dark Knight does not count)
871464638130552800,Sun Jun 04 20:32:15 +0000 2017,19) All that said, still a really good flick. I thought both Chris Pine and @GalGadot were great! Their scenes on Amazon island were A+
871464330549747700,Sun Jun 04 20:31:02 +0000 2017,18) Did some of the CGI in the #WonderWoman action sequences look off? Reminded me of the plastic Neo/Smith in Matrix Reloaded.
871463976219103200,Sun Jun 04 20:29:37 +0000 2017,17) why was Irish sharpshooter who could not shoot in the film? What was the point if you are not going to give him some purpose/redemption?
871463689467068400,Sun Jun 04 20:28:29 +0000 2017,16) She destroys a key German base and kills Germany's top general! Really, no one wonders who killed Ludendorff? She should be famous!!
871463457031413800,Sun Jun 04 20:27:33 +0000 2017,15) ...single-handedly crossed no-mans land in a crazy red and blue outfit? She then went on to defeat scores of German soldiers.
871463298541256700,Sun Jun 04 20:26:56 +0000 2017,14) Is it believable that hundreds of American and German soldiers never talked at all about the super-human woman who...
871463125014519800,Sun Jun 04 20:26:14 +0000 2017,13) Remember that when she shows up in #BatmanvSuperman , both Bats and Supes have no idea who she is or what she can do.
871463023050883100,Sun Jun 04 20:25:50 +0000 2017,12) Wonder Women deserves more backstory. Need to understand why she does not age. How does she impact humanity while remaining anonymous?
871462597542936600,Sun Jun 04 20:24:08 +0000 2017,11) And if that was Ares' plan, then why is it so imperative for Wonder Woman to kill him? Seems like man was the bad guy, not Ares.
871462444270530600,Sun Jun 04 20:23:32 +0000 2017,10) I know Ares tried to explain that he was allowing man to have free will and that man chose war, but that explanation didn't make sense.
871462272933273600,Sun Jun 04 20:22:51 +0000 2017,9) Ares was a terrible villain. I still don't really understand exactly what his big plan was or even if there was a big plan.
871462174123798500,Sun Jun 04 20:22:27 +0000 2017,8) This film portrays her as pretty much on par with Superman, not a "meta-human" who merely has extra strength and some cool gadgets
871461976056225800,Sun Jun 04 20:21:40 +0000 2017,7) Her powers do not jive with what we saw in BvS. Where was "huge shock wave when I clang my wrist bands together" versus Doomsday?
871461493212147700,Sun Jun 04 20:19:45 +0000 2017,6)  No break bones, she just stands up without a scratch on her. She has powers/abilities far beyond what she traditionally possesses
871461097336864800,Sun Jun 04 20:18:11 +0000 2017,5) Wonder Woman was straight up flying/hovering in the air throughout much of that battle. She gets thrown 100+ feet numerous times...
871460933784227800,Sun Jun 04 20:17:32 +0000 2017,4) Biggest problem is #WonderWoman battle with Ares. It involves characters with undefined powers (my biggest comic book movie pet peeve)
871460415196233700,Sun Jun 04 20:15:28 +0000 2017,3) Civil War, Winter Soldier, Avengers, Dark Knight, Deadpool, Iron Man, DOFP, and Guardians were all clearly better. No shame in that!
871460268630528000,Sun Jun 04 20:14:53 +0000 2017,2) Looking at the past 10-12 years, I think #wonderWoman slots in just behind the great comic book movies. Which are the greats?

524400853730332700,Tue Oct 21 03:24:41 +0000 2014,Is it just me or are the most interesting characters on #TheBlacklist Red's henchmen Glenn, Vargas, Mr. Karplan, and Dembe? @HISHAMTAWFIQ
524400288128458750,Tue Oct 21 03:22:26 +0000 2014,#TheBlacklist says we'll find out what is behind the door next week. It better be good (Tom?!?). This is one long tease. @NBCBlacklist
524362157756936200,Tue Oct 21 00:50:55 +0000 2014,Very possible but I think #WalkingDead brings back Morgan at mid-season RT @MomMusic my thought is that maybe a season has passed
524346511979597800,Mon Oct 20 23:48:45 +0000 2014,I made a screencap of Rick's #NoSanctuary sign &amp; one Morgan sees. Clearly lots of growth on Morgan's #WalkingDead http://t.co/nhpnaUB6ks

524310119287226400,Mon Oct 20 21:24:08 +0000 2014,Agreed, thought it got a bit too trippy at times in the back half RT @nicknunziata Both were good, but the 10:30 movie is a sensation.

523490095899238400,Sat Oct 18 15:05:39 +0000 2014,Same week DC picked a no-name to play movie version of #TheFlash, they pick three huge stars for Suicide Squad. Lack of confidence in SS?
523489875878637600,Sat Oct 18 15:04:47 +0000 2014,Word that Will Smith, Ryan Gosling, and Tom Hardy may be part of Suicide Squad… DC leaning on big stars to sell lesser comic characters ?

522819074951090200,Thu Oct 16 18:39:15 +0000 2014,@Michael_Calia I think Green Arrow is more of a realistic hero, no superpowers or cosmic magic stuff. But, I'd love to see him in a flick.
