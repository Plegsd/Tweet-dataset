728743119206940700,Sat May 07 00:27:53 +0000 2016,Frank Vogel will likely win a championship or at least take a team to the finals - it's upsetting it won't be the @pacers
728609560731123700,Fri May 06 15:37:10 +0000 2016,Few good situations for @Pacers with Vogel gone but the best: Someone from the Spurs comes to Indy: Hammon, Messina, or Manu @MillerTimePod
