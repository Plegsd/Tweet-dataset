819707429738819600,Fri Jan 13 00:47:35 +0000 2017,@yminsky tbh I'd consider ocaml very seriously if I were doing my own thing at this point, but for systems work Go has been a pleasure
819703987955826700,Fri Jan 13 00:33:54 +0000 2017,@yminsky exactly :-)
819703927448842200,Fri Jan 13 00:33:40 +0000 2017,@yminsky I think OCaml hits a sweeter spot in this sense: almost all the power but far less of the complexity tax of Scala.
819702636471414800,Fri Jan 13 00:28:32 +0000 2017,@alexelcu @runT1ME @yminsky @YouTube I guess I'd rather use 3 small languages than one big one.

819666300838346800,Thu Jan 12 22:04:09 +0000 2017,@alexelcu @yminsky I think most of Scala's complexities derive from a nonorthogonal feature set and Java/JVM compatiblity.

818906782701494300,Tue Jan 10 19:46:06 +0000 2017,@heathercmiller i know right? on twitter i feel almost extroverted.
818668506392629200,Tue Jan 10 03:59:16 +0000 2017,@yminsky i wouldn't doubt it. though one virtue of Go is that it's often simple to perform stack allocation in hot loops.
818668321566359600,Tue Jan 10 03:58:32 +0000 2017,@yminsky plus simpler/cleaned up syntax without shift/reduce conflicts, plus removing a bunch of features, plus a terrific standard library.
818668116834009100,Tue Jan 10 03:57:43 +0000 2017,@yminsky though interestingly, that complexity is sometimes warranted. e.g., Spark I think is a shining example of that.
818667558790271000,Tue Jan 10 03:55:30 +0000 2017,@yminsky but with Go, your startup is ready  from day one.
818667509347807200,Tue Jan 10 03:55:18 +0000 2017,@yminsky exactly. same is true of twitter (internally) and google (internally) and Facebook (interally), etc. etc.‚Ä¶
818667322680315900,Tue Jan 10 03:54:34 +0000 2017,@yminsky if i were to design a language/runtime today, it'd look like a cross between Go (runtime, concurrency) and SML (everything else).
818667108309442600,Tue Jan 10 03:53:43 +0000 2017,@yminsky i do admit that my being taken with Go is in part some immune system reaction from Scala‚Ä¶
818666711607980000,Tue Jan 10 03:52:08 +0000 2017,@yminsky the fact that Go has ready answers for most common engineering infrastructure problems is delightful.
818666547321315300,Tue Jan 10 03:51:29 +0000 2017,@yminsky i.e., a language is not just a language, it's an ecosystem: tools, standard libraries, build tools.. the "UX" matters a great deal.
818666427599097900,Tue Jan 10 03:51:01 +0000 2017,@yminsky i think we should take away that the package matters‚Ä¶
818666212976513000,Tue Jan 10 03:50:09 +0000 2017,@yminsky (though i think Leroy et.al. do a pretty stellar job too.)
818666153379647500,Tue Jan 10 03:49:55 +0000 2017,@yminsky in Go, there is generally just one [obvious] way to do something -- and they are a disciplined team about (not) adding features.
818665978041012200,Tue Jan 10 03:49:13 +0000 2017,@yminsky but there are still a number of features in ocaml (objects! polymorphic variants vs. variants) that are overloaded.
818665792136851500,Tue Jan 10 03:48:29 +0000 2017,@yminsky I do agree ocaml is simple, and I do wonder if it doesn't occupy a better place in the  power/weight curve ‚Ä¶
818665563895439400,Tue Jan 10 03:47:35 +0000 2017,@yminsky it's huge. but Scala is a simplicity counterexample (despite claims to the contrary)

818660418742665200,Tue Jan 10 03:27:08 +0000 2017,@yminsky mostly due to [good] tooling
818660375587536900,Tue Jan 10 03:26:58 +0000 2017,@yminsky well, you can certainly structure your code that way! in practice, i have found refactoring to be very pleasant ...
818630135620374500,Tue Jan 10 01:26:48 +0000 2017,@yminsky https://t.co/8mWutVctRB not withstanding
818629833462644700,Tue Jan 10 01:25:36 +0000 2017,@yminsky but this is a better fit for an imperative language. Plus it's so nice to have real stacks.
818629735865454600,Tue Jan 10 01:25:13 +0000 2017,@yminsky and to me, green threads plus CSP is a wonderful way to do concurrency. I love futures too, don't get me wrong, ‚Ä¶
818629414271336400,Tue Jan 10 01:23:56 +0000 2017,@yminsky but most importantly it just gets out of your way most of the time, while still affording high level useful abstraction.
818625583865217000,Tue Jan 10 01:08:43 +0000 2017,@yminsky oddly, with value types and funcs, Go encourages "value oriented" programming, which has always been one of my favorite FP things
818624715237433300,Tue Jan 10 01:05:16 +0000 2017,@yminsky its simplicity is a breath of fresh air in this computing landscape ... I do miss my variants though. (But that's about it.)
