117068125203214340,Fri Sep 23 02:49:50 +0000 2011,Romney has passion and spontaneity tonight. It was his night. Perry is 0 and 3.
117067114455633920,Fri Sep 23 02:45:49 +0000 2011,Romney can talk on a stage as can Huntsman. Perry and Bachman are robotic.
117060184794341380,Fri Sep 23 02:18:17 +0000 2011,A real debate there between Santorum and Huntsman over Afghanistan -  an important one.
117057709324505090,Fri Sep 23 02:08:27 +0000 2011,Perry is dying. He can't answer real questions on foreign policy.
117052929705385980,Fri Sep 23 01:49:27 +0000 2011,Bachmann to build a fence across southern border. Who would pay for it? She said tonight people should keep all their money.
117048810211000320,Fri Sep 23 01:33:05 +0000 2011,#Romney comes alive and refuses to be boxed in to calling #Obama names.
117047607586598910,Fri Sep 23 01:28:18 +0000 2011,The robot is speaking again. It calls itself "we" when defending itself.
117044532104802300,Fri Sep 23 01:16:05 +0000 2011,#Bachmann said people should keep all their money and not pay taxes. Who should pay her congressional salary?
116235788232032260,Tue Sep 20 19:42:26 +0000 2011,#Obama has rung the bell.  The campaign’s on.  He’s asking the American people to say they want a fair tax burden.  Gutsy move.
115870967774978050,Mon Sep 19 19:32:46 +0000 2011,Just talked to my Rep. brother Jim - Mont. Co., PA commissioner. Says Romney-Rubio best ticket.  Food for thought.

111947330994966530,Thu Sep 08 23:41:38 +0000 2011,I sense we're hearing the first refrain of "Give 'em hell, Barry."
111943557878775800,Thu Sep 08 23:26:38 +0000 2011,"Structurally deficient" - by the way - is what that Minnesota bridge was before it collapsed.
111942869648023550,Thu Sep 08 23:23:54 +0000 2011,There are now more than 90 bridges that are "structurally deficient" in Speaker Boehner's district. Is that why he looks to be in pain?

111826625053732860,Thu Sep 08 15:41:59 +0000 2011,Big result of last night: with Bachmann falling and Romney denying membership, Perry is the Tea Party nominee. #reagandebate
111615164608028670,Thu Sep 08 01:41:43 +0000 2011,Romney did well enough for No. 2.  No changes in order of support after tonight.  #reagandebate
111615103278915580,Thu Sep 08 01:41:28 +0000 2011,Perry on top by open to media attack on "Ponzi scheme" description of Social Security and his refusal to accept manmade climate-change.
111614759480201220,Thu Sep 08 01:40:07 +0000 2011,Bottom line: The standing of the candidates was unaffected by tonight's performances.  #reagandebate
111614424304975870,Thu Sep 08 01:38:47 +0000 2011,Perry looks unsteady trying to question climate change.  He's an oil patch politician saying what they must.  He's not solid and shows it.
111613724929957890,Thu Sep 08 01:36:00 +0000 2011,Good for Huntsman, standing up for science and against the ludites.  #reagandebate
111612966436225020,Thu Sep 08 01:32:59 +0000 2011,Have these people forgotten that this country is at war in 2 countries? Are they walking away from wars like they did from financial crisis?
111607410719862780,Thu Sep 08 01:10:54 +0000 2011,Romney is dead right. Illegal hiring is the key reason for illegal immigration.  But business won't stop.  It pays. Cheap labor pays.
111607267421458430,Thu Sep 08 01:10:20 +0000 2011,Perry said Obama might be an "abject liar" on issue of southern border defense. This langauge is good for the hall, maybe not the country.
111606876868837380,Thu Sep 08 01:08:47 +0000 2011,Finally Newt speaks well. He's right on charter schools, especially inner cities like Philadelphia.  A broken clock is right twice a debate!
111606283513237500,Thu Sep 08 01:06:26 +0000 2011,What neo-con came up with the word "homeland?  What was wrong with saying "defending America," of good old civil defense? #reagandebate
111605526990823420,Thu Sep 08 01:03:25 +0000 2011,The Gyro Gearlooses have taken over the debate - all this jabber about the TSA and Homeland Security will not decide who leads America.
111603319738339330,Thu Sep 08 00:54:39 +0000 2011,This is becoming a two-ring circus: the anchormen - Perry, Romney and Huntsman in one ring, the Gyro Gearlooses in the other.
111602771622502400,Thu Sep 08 00:52:28 +0000 2011,Perry's got the headline - for better or worse. "Ponzi scheme" leads the NYT banner tomorrow AM!  #reagandebate
111602114282790910,Thu Sep 08 00:49:52 +0000 2011,Perry just called the current Social Security System a "Ponzi scheme," a "monstrous lie."  This will be a headline. He's now Paul Ryan.
111600052727857150,Thu Sep 08 00:41:40 +0000 2011,I give the first half hour to Perry.  He combined calm confidence and easy repartee with the red meat this crowd eats up.  #reagandebate
111599050985455620,Thu Sep 08 00:37:41 +0000 2011,Huntsman made a good point: President Obama should get out from behind his teleprompter and tell us where he wants this country to go.
111598457160089600,Thu Sep 08 00:35:20 +0000 2011,Romney's problem is that he's a businessman trying to be a "career politician." He's been running for office since 1994.  #reagandebate
111598090351419400,Thu Sep 08 00:33:52 +0000 2011,Perry just pulled a smart one, quoting JFK.  Republicans who do that - Ronald Reagan - Scott Brown - tend to win.  #reagandebate
111597631674925060,Thu Sep 08 00:32:03 +0000 2011,Say what you will, Santorum believes what he says. He's not here to play games like Newt.  #reagandebate
111596945641967620,Thu Sep 08 00:29:19 +0000 2011,Newt just attacked the media for getting Republicans to fight with each other. He's attacking the moderators for running a debate!!!
111595595407425540,Thu Sep 08 00:23:57 +0000 2011,Perry just scored on Romney by tying Mitt's healthcare plan to Obama's. He's now giving the strong red meat argument the right loves.
111595143072714750,Thu Sep 08 00:22:10 +0000 2011,Romney just made a good case for the individual mandate.  He should be selling Obamacare.  #reagandebate
111594760355057660,Thu Sep 08 00:20:38 +0000 2011,Leave it to Newt Gingrich to throw the first bombs about "class warfare" and "bureacratic socialism." It's what he does. #reagandebate
111593093316358140,Thu Sep 08 00:14:01 +0000 2011,Debate looks like audition for Anchorman. Lots of clever ad libs. No passion. #reagandebate
111542888709627900,Wed Sep 07 20:54:31 +0000 2011,Bobby Kennedy's final advice to Jack before Nixon debate: "kick him in the balls." Who'll do it tonight?
