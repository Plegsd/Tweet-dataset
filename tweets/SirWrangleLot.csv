888089296649027600,Thu Jul 20 17:32:42 +0000 2017,Nets fans should hope Marvin Bagley does NOT reclassify to '17. Currently, he'll be in draft in '19, when Nets have pick. (1/2)

881008116766306300,Sat Jul 01 04:34:38 +0000 2017,Woj says #Nets committed to Lin/Russell backcourt with Redick coming off bench.
881007892761071600,Sat Jul 01 04:33:44 +0000 2017,Woj says Brooklyn only willing to do two years for JJ Redick. Wolves interested too. More committed longer term. Sixers just one year.

877300558125772800,Tue Jun 20 23:02:07 +0000 2017,Brook Lopez is a true professional. #Lakers get a back to the basket center who can now shoot 3s.
877298795733798900,Tue Jun 20 22:55:06 +0000 2017,I hope #Nets use Russell and 22nd and flip for a lottery pick.

874464380674560000,Tue Jun 13 03:12:09 +0000 2017,Not sure why they don't just have JR take every 3-pointer for the rest of the game.
874462916027797500,Tue Jun 13 03:06:20 +0000 2017,Why are they drilling Kyrie's back?

874446234173440000,Tue Jun 13 02:00:03 +0000 2017,I'm surprised Draymond helped Thompson up.
874443758745653200,Tue Jun 13 01:50:13 +0000 2017,I think KD fouled LBJ there.

859603782191198200,Wed May 03 03:01:26 +0000 2017,@Trinkwald I don't feel the CB4 is distinctive enough. I personally haven't seen the movie either. Thanks though.

834605875889315800,Thu Feb 23 03:28:41 +0000 2017,#Bulls fans: If Butler dealt, Wade's decisions not necessarily dealt on winning. Very comfortable being at home. https://t.co/9joNPvdiwz

823568415772307500,Mon Jan 23 16:29:46 +0000 2017,@HarveyAraton I'd go for the Nets home fun. Throw in Bojan and anybody else except LeVert for that 2018 pick. I'd even give up RHJ for that.
823566508295065600,Mon Jan 23 16:22:11 +0000 2017,@HarveyAraton My thinking is that w/ new CBA, big guns like Boogie, Butler less likely to be traded. Ainge should look at lower tier.

823377384724463600,Mon Jan 23 03:50:40 +0000 2017,I liked Jarrett Allen a bit bitter. He can't handle being double-teamed, but he has a good mid-range game and does typical big-man stuff.
823377167371370500,Mon Jan 23 03:49:48 +0000 2017,Josh Jackson looked fine, but he didn't impress me that much. Shot OK, drove OK, but he didn't look significantly better than everyone else.
823366860620103700,Mon Jan 23 03:08:51 +0000 2017,Josh Jackson and Jarrett Allen have the biggest fros in the game so that is a huge bonus.
823366258506793000,Mon Jan 23 03:06:28 +0000 2017,Kansas/Texas next. Checking out Josh Jackson and Jarrett Allen.

822281388661547000,Fri Jan 20 03:15:34 +0000 2017,You think maybe Porzingis should've touched the ball the last few possessions?
822281106917650400,Fri Jan 20 03:14:27 +0000 2017,Two facts. Melo loves iso. John Wall is fast.

822277774274609200,Fri Jan 20 03:01:13 +0000 2017,Melo finished proving his point at halftime.
822272694263619600,Fri Jan 20 02:41:02 +0000 2017,Good on Porzingis for helping on that Wall drive. Lot of bigs would've avoided the "poster dunk."

816664648019832800,Wed Jan 04 15:16:39 +0000 2017,@MZavagno11 Hmmm. If I end up using your idea, the shirt is yours for free. Need to research it more though before I commit.
816662383846375400,Wed Jan 04 15:07:39 +0000 2017,@MZavagno11 Thanks a ton! I do notice that the young up-and-coming players sell well.
816661676112089100,Wed Jan 04 15:04:51 +0000 2017,@MZavagno11 Possibly! I know he's the best Nugs player. I haven't given it too much thought yet. But I will. Stay tuned.

815279950546735100,Sat Dec 31 19:34:22 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir back atcha!
815270679566291000,Sat Dec 31 18:57:31 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir perhaps it was a far. I was factoring his injury.
815270441933803500,Sat Dec 31 18:56:35 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir yes, I though this season would be his breakout season. Injuries have been frustrating. He could still break out later in season.
815270074378494000,Sat Dec 31 18:55:07 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir Irving, Lowry, Wall, Thomas, Kemba all better. Yes, Lin has a very unique story.
815267989503217700,Sat Dec 31 18:46:50 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir also feel many Lin fans too biased towards him based on Linsanity.
815267678244008000,Sat Dec 31 18:45:36 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir props to your skills and agree on essence. Not sure where miscommunication was. Still don't think Lin is an all-star.
815266772177875000,Sat Dec 31 18:42:00 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir you have a fair argument with the numbers there. Relative 2 other PGs let alone guards, more players better. He COULD get there tho
815266206777221100,Sat Dec 31 18:39:45 +0000 2016,@NardiaHuang this is precisely what the NBA does. https://t.co/5bjCOAx171
815262955017224200,Sat Dec 31 18:26:49 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir Isaiah Thomas was the 60th pick in the draft. Lowry 24th pick. Neither waltzed in. I'm not attacking Lin. Just stating my opinion.
815262024359964700,Sat Dec 31 18:23:08 +0000 2016,@IdoAmir What's the essence of basketball? You tell me.
815088146908086300,Sat Dec 31 06:52:12 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 you too!
815088048585265200,Sat Dec 31 06:51:49 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 yes  he's an underdog. Just not better than 5 East PGs. Google Kyrie Irving he is SO fun to watch. And better than Lin.
815087520773980200,Sat Dec 31 06:49:43 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 don't think i'm smarter than anyone. I think that if most Lin fans watched these other PGs play, they'd agree they're better.
815086469845024800,Sat Dec 31 06:45:32 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3. I know. I also know that 5 PGs are empirically better than Lin in the East. I hope he gets there, but he is not.
815085716640305200,Sat Dec 31 06:42:33 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 if he wasn't Asian, would you honestly care about him?
815085502961483800,Sat Dec 31 06:41:42 +0000 2016,@thesuitedmonk88 I'd love it if Lin deserved to be an all-star. Not there yet. Maybe down the road. The NBA has devalued fan votes to 50%
815084778185773000,Sat Dec 31 06:38:49 +0000 2016,@jon_man7502 I gotcha. If he was healthy all year, perhaps on par with Thomas. Kyrie, Lowry, Wall, Kemba all better. Down the road? Maybe!
815084134515245000,Sat Dec 31 06:36:15 +0000 2016,@_bk_chino kyrie, Kemba, wall, Thomas, or Lowry, that would be a disservice to NBA fans - which is why league devalued fan vote.
815083755991920600,Sat Dec 31 06:34:45 +0000 2016,@_bk_chino you're right, I agree. I just feel that Lin fans would vote for him no matter what. And if he gets voted in ahead of...
815080962417639400,Sat Dec 31 06:23:39 +0000 2016,@jon_man7502 @JLFan888 More than Westbrook, Harden, CP3, Conley, Lillard, Kyrie, Lowry, Kemba, Wall, I. Thomas? Really? Do you watch NBA?
815079017116213200,Sat Dec 31 06:15:55 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 you are absolutely correct. And because of this, the league took measures to reduce fan vote value from 100 to 50%.
815078643970035700,Sat Dec 31 06:14:26 +0000 2016,@lemonbar4948 @JLFan888 you have a point. Lin is of utmost character in league. However, those 5 east guards on court more deserving.
815077680299339800,Sat Dec 31 06:10:37 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 @cheesychee3 come on, have u watched Curry play? Sure, his numbers are down this year b/c of Durant. But Lin does not touch Curry
815077333006684200,Sat Dec 31 06:09:14 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 no I don't think either deserve to be in game. But Lin's Asian-American factor skews that. If he were black/white, not relevant.
815076377401630700,Sat Dec 31 06:05:26 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 I agree again. But for the all-star game I want the highest quality guards to represent east. Lin not close. Yet.
815076100502147100,Sat Dec 31 06:04:20 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 you are correct, I agree. But if you have ever watched Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, or Kemba Walker play, I bet u switch
815075737099243500,Sat Dec 31 06:02:53 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 I'm not arguing that Lin/Sessions fans can't vote for them. I'm arguing they should not. 4 East PGs significantly better than both
815075304679108600,Sat Dec 31 06:01:10 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 I'm one of many. Again, fan vote is davalued to 50% with media and players controlling other 50. Lin has no chance.
815074598962204700,Sat Dec 31 05:58:22 +0000 2016,@1028gokc vote all you want, but league has taken measures to devalue fan vote to 50%. Players and media control other 50%.
815074279662428200,Sat Dec 31 05:57:06 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 you'd rather see Zaza than Davis, Blake, Gasol, Cousins, Dirk? Should be best most entertaining players for fans.
815073729403355100,Sat Dec 31 05:54:55 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 again, I don't mean to be a bully. I just want Lin fans to realize he is not there yet. Season or 3 from now? Maybe!
815073401467535400,Sat Dec 31 05:53:36 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 believe me, I'd love it if Lin were an all-star. Yes, he's improving. But not there yet. 4 much better PGs in east.
815072701316497400,Sat Dec 31 05:50:49 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 you can. But the NBA had taken measures to devalue fan votes. Zaza Pachulia almost got voted in last year.
815072315872604200,Sat Dec 31 05:49:18 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 @cheesychee3 I'll admit to being condescending on this topic and apologize. I'm being realistic. When Lin put up the #s, I'll vote
815071807913029600,Sat Dec 31 05:47:16 +0000 2016,@thesuitedmonk88 i can love the player and be realistic that he does not deserve to be an all-star. Irving, Thomas, Wall, Walker all better.
815071270803042300,Sat Dec 31 05:45:08 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 it's obvious you don't know anything about the NBA. Vote for Lin all you want. The NBA has take measures to devalue your vote.
815070905416216600,Sat Dec 31 05:43:41 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 do you even know who those players are? Do you even watch the NBA outside of Lin?
815070626234953700,Sat Dec 31 05:42:35 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 @cheesychee3 No Lin better than Sessions. But Kyrie, Kemba, Kyle Lowry, Isaiah Thomas, John Wall all better. Do your homework.
815069577034010600,Sat Dec 31 05:38:25 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 do you even understand what 50/40/90 means? Lin career is 43/34/80. 2016 47/33/70. No comparison. Do your homework.
815066083061354500,Sat Dec 31 05:24:32 +0000 2016,Face it. If @JLin7 were not Chinese-American, you would not care about him. At. All. I am Chinese-American BTW. #NBAVOTE
815065861744656400,Sat Dec 31 05:23:39 +0000 2016,So anyone who thinks @JLin7 deserves All-Star vote, you are wrong. And league agrees.
815065734795694100,Sat Dec 31 05:23:09 +0000 2016,NBA has devalued the fans vote from 100% to 50%. Players and some media other 50%. To prevent ignorant fan voting.  https://t.co/fdClE01rx0
815064982517858300,Sat Dec 31 05:20:09 +0000 2016,I'd like to reiterate anyone voting for @JLin7 for #NBAVOTE is uninformed &amp; doesn't deserve vote. League took measures 2 devalue fan's vote.
815064523442946000,Sat Dec 31 05:18:20 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 Are you aware Curry was an MVP an shot 50-40-90? Do you even know what that means? These are ridiculous arguments.
815064346787246100,Sat Dec 31 05:17:38 +0000 2016,@cheesychee3 @JLFan888 U R correct. I'm saying u r uninformed &amp; ignorant of the NBA. And don't deserve a vote if u think Lin is an All-Star.
815062825508991000,Sat Dec 31 05:11:35 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 Also, if you think John Wall, Isaiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving, &amp; Kemba Walker are all worse than Lin, you are an uninformed NBA fan.
815062630440243200,Sat Dec 31 05:10:48 +0000 2016,@JLFan888 Steph's PER is 23.9. Lin 20. Curry FG% 46.7. Lin 46.9. Equal. However, Curry's EFG% 57.7%. Lin 53.1%. I think you are wrong.
814927841821392900,Fri Dec 30 20:15:12 +0000 2016,I think Larry Sanders just referred to Serge Ibaka as "the African" in his last tweet. @l8show_thegoat

814887875426783200,Fri Dec 30 17:36:24 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo I'm also saying you can carry on with your vote. I'm saying it's uninformed. And the league did something about it this season.
814885150098161700,Fri Dec 30 17:25:34 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo My point is that Kyrie Irving, Kyle Lowry, Kemba Walker &amp; Isiah Thomas are better East PGs than Lin. Lin is inferior to all.
814884644197961700,Fri Dec 30 17:23:33 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo Kobe is retired so you cannot vote for him.
814884283097763800,Fri Dec 30 17:22:07 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo You can vote who for whoever you want. Most NBA fans love statistics.
814883853592625200,Fri Dec 30 17:20:25 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo But the all-star game is for on the court. You do know Kobe is retired, right?
814883114845605900,Fri Dec 30 17:17:29 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo Be realistic. Lin is not all-star by any means. He's been on 6 teams in 7 seasons. Career 13.9 pts, 3.2 rbs, 5.8 dimes, PER 15.3
814882297027694600,Fri Dec 30 17:14:14 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo Kobe has 5 rings, 15x all-star, 15x All-NBA, 12x-all defense, scoring title 2x. 25 pts, 5.2 rebs, 4.7 ast, PER 22.9 (career).
814879763953315800,Fri Dec 30 17:04:10 +0000 2016,@tsweettoo True, but Kobe is 10x better than Lin. I'm happy that fans only make 50% of the vote to prevent this. https://t.co/kW8WSaZ2hv
814872361371635700,Fri Dec 30 16:34:45 +0000 2016,I love @JLin7. But please stop with the #NBAVOTE. He hasn't even played half the games, and when healthy, not even close to an All-Star.
