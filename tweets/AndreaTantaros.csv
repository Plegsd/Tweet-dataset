641322001953595400,Tue Sep 08 18:47:35 +0000 2015,Taking Islamic refugees would be suicide. It's an easy way for ISIS to infiltrate US, &amp; where does it end? We have enough immigration probs.

629464007670411300,Fri Aug 07 01:28:08 +0000 2015,Trump is right. GOP has been scared to talk about illegal immigration. Some of the candidates on stage have been obessed with amnesty.
