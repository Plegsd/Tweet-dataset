784090635489964000,Thu Oct 06 17:59:09 +0000 2016,Just dont understand it at all. All their loyal nexus customers have just been priced out of the pixel. Doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Rant over :/
784090118349058000,Thu Oct 06 17:57:06 +0000 2016,Apple charge a lot for their phones. Lets copy that and we will be successful as well‚Ä¶ Err no.
784089696167194600,Thu Oct 06 17:55:25 +0000 2016,I loved Nexus. But clearly it wasn‚Äôt successful or it would still be a thing. Why is making the phones more expensive going to work ?
784089105571389400,Thu Oct 06 17:53:05 +0000 2016,I dont understand why Google think selling premium phones for premium money will be more popular than selling premium phones cheap
