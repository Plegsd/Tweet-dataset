890977839020953600,Fri Jul 28 16:50:45 +0000 2017,7. Change the way you fund campaigns and you change who can run &amp; who they listen to once they're in office!
890977360467636200,Fri Jul 28 16:48:50 +0000 2017,6. Small-donor matching systems mean women leaders can run on the support of their communities, even without big donors.
890977123816669200,Fri Jul 28 16:47:54 +0000 2017,5. So if you want to see more #WomenInPolitics (and we hope you do!) let's change how we fund campaigns so it's no longer a barrier.

890976604947705900,Fri Jul 28 16:45:50 +0000 2017,3. One of the barriers, a big one, is money in politics. Women often lack access to networks of wealthy people &amp; can't fund a campaign.
890976221215043600,Fri Jul 28 16:44:19 +0000 2017,2. BUT we also need to be real about the barriers that women face to running. Barriers that have been designed to keep them from running.
