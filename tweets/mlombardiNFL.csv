1186060077884694500,Sun Oct 20 23:22:13 +0000 2019,Sadly for Bear fans but quarterbacks on field today rankings.   1. Teddy 2 Taysom 3 Chase 4 MVP Mitch.
1186058740694487000,Sun Oct 20 23:16:54 +0000 2019,Both teams tried to lose that game.  I‚Äôm stunned.  It shifted my picks from 2-3 to 3-2.  Amazing
1186058090799648800,Sun Oct 20 23:14:19 +0000 2019,This Tennessee game is completely wild.  Wow.
1186054803044085800,Sun Oct 20 23:01:15 +0000 2019,Tennessee you deserve to lose.  No one to blame but yourself.
1186053436783112200,Sun Oct 20 22:55:49 +0000 2019,Can someone explain why no challenge for Titans?   Horrible.
1186053218075320300,Sun Oct 20 22:54:57 +0000 2019,That was a first down. He didn‚Äôt lose a yard.  Horrible.
1186053111338668000,Sun Oct 20 22:54:32 +0000 2019,Why no challenge Tennessee?
1186050265826414600,Sun Oct 20 22:43:13 +0000 2019,I honestly believe the lack of offense has taken the will of the Bears defense away.
1186049368136278000,Sun Oct 20 22:39:39 +0000 2019,A lot when they are on offense.  Not so much when they play D. The D has a better chance to score. https://t.co/D3zV6aDZKG
1186048536808493000,Sun Oct 20 22:36:21 +0000 2019,If MVP Mitch was a prize fight they would stop it.  At what point to the Bears admit what we all know????
1186039553968226300,Sun Oct 20 22:00:39 +0000 2019,MVP Mitch has made Troy tongue tide.
1186037966650654700,Sun Oct 20 21:54:21 +0000 2019,At some point Matt Nagy is going to have to let MVP Mitch play.
1186033530792530000,Sun Oct 20 21:36:43 +0000 2019,Never doubted it.  Peters would get a pick today.  Said it on Lombardi Line.  all time great guesser
1186001266436116500,Sun Oct 20 19:28:31 +0000 2019,Interesting play calling in the RZ by Raiders
1185998461956776000,Sun Oct 20 19:17:22 +0000 2019,Carr and the middle eight killed the Raiders chances.
1185992344136499200,Sun Oct 20 18:53:04 +0000 2019,Text book example of why the middle eight matters.  Raiders are going on to score and take a 17-14 lead now will be down 28-10.
1185987439501987800,Sun Oct 20 18:33:34 +0000 2019,Raiders took the ball after winning the coin toss to play from in front.  Now they lose middle 8 and might be down‚Ä¶ https://t.co/ENAayVd4fi
