771336740678332400,Thu Sep 01 13:19:44 +0000 2016,14. To understand Chicago’s murder problem, it’s worth another look at this from @fordfess and @haeyoun https://t.co/O3P0O7BeV5
771336586000732200,Thu Sep 01 13:19:07 +0000 2016,13. With schools starting, there is hope for a natural slowdown, but no certainty of that, plus more bracing for a long Labor Day weekend.
771336465670340600,Thu Sep 01 13:18:38 +0000 2016,12. In interview, Eddie Johnson calls this a “difficult, challenging” summer.  “Do I think we can recover and be better? Yes, I do.”

771335568324173800,Thu Sep 01 13:15:04 +0000 2016,7. Summer is always the worst, and there’s been a palpable sense of Chicago bracing the last few months as new, painful stats kept coming.
771335454062936000,Thu Sep 01 13:14:37 +0000 2016,6. Chicago saw an uptick in murders in 2012: more than 500 for the year. https://t.co/fZuaXxLwvA But at this rate, 2016 could be far worse.
771335326866501600,Thu Sep 01 13:14:07 +0000 2016,5. Non-fatal shootings are also way up: more than 2,330. That’s about 48 percent over the same period last year.
771335114160742400,Thu Sep 01 13:13:16 +0000 2016,4. That’s more murders this year in the nation’s third largest city than in New York and Los Angeles – combined.
