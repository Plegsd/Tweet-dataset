914842305395228700,Mon Oct 02 13:19:37 +0000 2017,As for Butt's possible recall, I hope not; young players on duty need a decent run of games. Pleasing to see Haris Sohail do well #PAKvSL

798015239182643200,Mon Nov 14 04:10:34 +0000 2016,@ThallonW I tend to think the '84 declaration is overplayed as Eng were 9 down anyway &amp; WI ended up winning with 15-odd overs left...

797861516259299300,Sun Nov 13 17:59:43 +0000 2016,The only generous Test declaration I can think of off the top of my head was Sobers v Eng in 1968 &amp; he's been reminded of it ever since.
797861207818600400,Sun Nov 13 17:58:30 +0000 2016,So is there ever an accepted stage of a series to dangle a carrot, &amp; risk losing to try &amp; win? #INDvENG 3/3
797860349080989700,Sun Nov 13 17:55:05 +0000 2016,And don't give opponents a sporting closure towards the end of a series either ("Don't let a generous declaration cost you the series") 2/3
797860103139508200,Sun Nov 13 17:54:06 +0000 2016,Re. declarations, heard it said not to give opponents a sniff at start of a series ("Don't want to be chasing the series if you lose") 1/3

792695157091135500,Sun Oct 30 11:50:27 +0000 2016,In a tour of spectacular collapses, was appropriate the most spectacular was saved for last. Made for wonderful, watchable action #BANvENG
792693733271691300,Sun Oct 30 11:44:48 +0000 2016,Success of #BANvENG hopefully clears the way for #BANvAUS next year. Maybe lessons for Pakistan too? A chat with BCB would do no harm.
792692859161997300,Sun Oct 30 11:41:19 +0000 2016,Problem for Eng heading to India is they'll be picking from 15 not 16 as Ballance looks un-selectable v spin after his #BANvENG struggles.

790529066608824300,Mon Oct 24 12:23:11 +0000 2016,@subash_banjade Yes, but I consider him a Test bowler already when fit. With Al Amin &amp; Taskin fit &amp; in form too it looks a good seam attack.
790500012396515300,Mon Oct 24 10:27:44 +0000 2016,@SimonCox2611 Spot on, but I think he's made his mark in Tests already; the other two still need to do so. If all fit &amp; firing, good attack!
790499469406179300,Mon Oct 24 10:25:34 +0000 2016,Hugely positive Test for @BCBtigers confirming last 2 yrs' progress; key now is to use disappointment in Mirpur, not be weighed down by it.

727525756843233300,Tue May 03 15:50:31 +0000 2016,@IndianMourinho It's a good talking point though. My view's always go for a specialist, hence my original tweet. You may agree, you may not.
727525516102778900,Tue May 03 15:49:34 +0000 2016,@IndianMourinho And stats say that if you bat at 7 in T20s you face less than 10 balls in average; it's up to top-order to get runs.

727395072841506800,Tue May 03 07:11:14 +0000 2016,@Chandra_Swami I guess they want AB to concentrate on his batting; bear in mind he's also one of their best outfielders.
727208562703769600,Mon May 02 18:50:06 +0000 2016,KL Rahul's missed stumping of Andre Russell was the reason why Aus chose Peter Nevill as keeper at #wt20. A top gloveman can win you games.

620619894422290400,Mon Jul 13 15:44:48 +0000 2015,@Siggo Absolutely. The two Q events should've been swapped. As it is, it makes no sense.

620618718960201700,Mon Jul 13 15:40:07 +0000 2015,#wt20q but this event really should've been in subcontinental conditions to allow qualifiers to play in conditions they'll face in 2016.

617572877366202400,Sun Jul 05 05:57:02 +0000 2015,A very sad read, the story of a top sportsman desperate to keep playing but whose body would no longer let him - http://t.co/NOUvCBAPEz
617289973876703200,Sat Jul 04 11:12:53 +0000 2015,@Abubakar9961 I'm watching the news, like everyone else. Let's hope he's okay. One of the nicest, friend and genuine people in cricket.
617289094113046500,Sat Jul 04 11:09:23 +0000 2015,#BobTaylor 's career is a reminder of another era when keepers were specialists in their own right &amp; batting was a secondary consideration.
617288793427546100,Sat Jul 04 11:08:11 +0000 2015,Listen for sound of ball hitting #BobTaylor 's gloves; you won't hear any! Beautiful soft hands, &amp; footwork so good he rarely had to dive...
617288293617524700,Sat Jul 04 11:06:12 +0000 2015,Want to know how good a keeper #BobTaylor was? Apart from the stats - 1649 FC dismissals - that'll never be beaten, watch footage of him...
617282354990559200,Sat Jul 04 10:42:36 +0000 2015,Shocked &amp; saddened to hear ex-@ECB_cricket 's #BobTaylor suffered a heart attack. Brilliant keeper &amp; wonderful man. Fingers crossed for him.
616582208942309400,Thu Jul 02 12:20:28 +0000 2015,@JacobsBen Sorry to disappoint but I attended a media conference after a Pakistan - Australia match in Sharjah in 2012 at 2.45am!
616568887262318600,Thu Jul 02 11:27:32 +0000 2015,@afaq_soomro Unfortunately no, but will be following it closely, of course.
616568745549434900,Thu Jul 02 11:26:58 +0000 2015,@Steptoesyard Nepal v HK was a cracker and as for that Afghanistan-Ireland final... I'd expect Scotland to do far better this time too.
616562496766251000,Thu Jul 02 11:02:09 +0000 2015,It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway), this will be a fantastic tournament... https://t.co/GLuxNArvjn
615839951712682000,Tue Jun 30 11:11:00 +0000 2015,RT @FAWales: .@UEFA have just announced that the FAW has secured the @ChampionsLeague Final for #Cardiff in 2017. http://t.co/O0PBrzrUqY
615783790837772300,Tue Jun 30 07:27:51 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 Like I said before, Test cricket is, IMO, strategy, tactics, complexity, entertainment, all in one package.
615780096285081600,Tue Jun 30 07:13:10 +0000 2015,RT @CricketAus: The response from fans to the day-night Test announcement is quite clear: http://t.co/muWBkXcVnK #AUSvNZ http://t.co/IXQQRM‚Ä¶
615780048889458700,Tue Jun 30 07:12:58 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 Limited overs matches here sell out most times. People want D/N cricket here, it's that simple.
615779820471873500,Tue Jun 30 07:12:04 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 Huge ex-pat population from sub-continent &amp; conditions are perfect Oct to April. Just that everyone is here to work...
615776653810110500,Tue Jun 30 06:59:29 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 We get no fans watching matches here in the UAE despite free entry as everybody works. Result is empty stadiums &amp; no atmosphere.
615773156989513700,Tue Jun 30 06:45:35 +0000 2015,Lovely discussion, this, between two top captains. Well worth a read - http://t.co/EiISCO5imU
615772967327240200,Tue Jun 30 06:44:50 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 Given many Tests take place with few, if any, people in the ground, surely having spectators is preferable.
615772793708220400,Tue Jun 30 06:44:09 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 As I said before, no-one is suggesting every Test is played as D/N, just the ones where conditions &amp; circumstances suit...
615772575889657900,Tue Jun 30 06:43:17 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 And why can't a match played as day/night be just as complex &amp; absorbing as a match played during the day?
615772320754372600,Tue Jun 30 06:42:16 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 Can't we be both? I like to think I am.
615744688956420100,Tue Jun 30 04:52:28 +0000 2015,@jennyah46 What is? D/N Tests or remembering cricket is an entertainment? It's not meant to happen with no-one watching, after all.
615744129755017200,Tue Jun 30 04:50:15 +0000 2015,@johnnorthants53 Fair call but let's see how it plays out with a different time of day. If we don't try then we'll never know.
615743685146193900,Tue Jun 30 04:48:29 +0000 2015,@Kirkee80 Well, the powers-that-be have considered that &amp; feel it's good enough. Let's see - literally!
