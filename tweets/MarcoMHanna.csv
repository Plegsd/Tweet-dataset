938793050490462200,Thu Dec 07 15:31:19 +0000 2017,Let me stress that BTC, while crazy profitable is still crazy volatile. Don’t buy in the hype if you can’t afford to lose what you put in.
938792244693348400,Thu Dec 07 15:28:07 +0000 2017,Bitcoin is about to hit 17,000 USD.

938587875981045800,Thu Dec 07 01:56:02 +0000 2017,Bitcoin sitting steady at 14.3K is ridiculous. 20% growth in 24 hrs is crazy. I’m scared.
938543783695781900,Wed Dec 06 23:00:49 +0000 2017,So maybe $15K today?
938536849404059600,Wed Dec 06 22:33:16 +0000 2017,Yeah, so BTC is $100 away from $14K. Stupid crazy. But amazing.
938536302546440200,Wed Dec 06 22:31:06 +0000 2017,Uh, BTC might hit 14K today.

937418859526664200,Sun Dec 03 20:30:47 +0000 2017,@OriginaldoBo Honestly, ETH right now is killing it too. Thankfully had some and bought a few more when it was $380.
937418760234946600,Sun Dec 03 20:30:23 +0000 2017,@OriginaldoBo I bought some a while back haha. Bought some more when it was $80.
937418383494209500,Sun Dec 03 20:28:53 +0000 2017,@OriginaldoBo IMO, LTC is directly tied to BTC. ETH can stand on its own, but both really grew because of BTC’s popularity.

937416878338838500,Sun Dec 03 20:22:54 +0000 2017,BTC: 11.89K, ETH: $483, LTC: $107. LTC was sub $50 in August.
937416397512151000,Sun Dec 03 20:21:00 +0000 2017,@OriginaldoBo If you haven’t bought it yet, maybe too late. $107 now.
937340440524845000,Sun Dec 03 15:19:10 +0000 2017,BTC might break $12,000 today. Ethereum is nearing $500 again, and LTC has been above $100. What a time to be alive folks.

908589979915505700,Fri Sep 15 07:15:06 +0000 2017,Prediction: iPhone X won’t be anything like this…. Just saying.
908588683405733900,Fri Sep 15 07:09:57 +0000 2017,Oh crap. Why did I select 8am for 9/22?

908583954390945800,Fri Sep 15 06:51:10 +0000 2017,@Jon4Lakers Probably so. My wallet is just used to being abused this time of the year.

908513229311238100,Fri Sep 15 02:10:07 +0000 2017,@SnazzyQ I’m buying this 8 Plus solely based on resale. Haha.
908513063543955500,Fri Sep 15 02:09:28 +0000 2017,I am surprised by the amount of people who say they don’t want the iPhone 8. I get it but dang. $999 is a lot of $.
908512817967505400,Fri Sep 15 02:08:29 +0000 2017,@SnazzyQ I agree. I’ll buy whichever is available on 9/22 lol. SG though. Well, maybe Silver but the white front = barf.
908512281910227000,Fri Sep 15 02:06:22 +0000 2017,@SnazzyQ Though the question is 64 or 256?

908112819316559900,Wed Sep 13 23:39:02 +0000 2017,@theCircaTECH @SnazzyQ Well, for X it's requiring carrier. 8/8 Plus does not!

908109623550513200,Wed Sep 13 23:26:20 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 It's really pretty. I'm getting the SG 8+ so I'll see how it looks IRL. Will compare to the silver too!
908109458076848100,Wed Sep 13 23:25:41 +0000 2017,@SnazzyQ You'd think but it tags off your iPhone due to the integrated sim. I wonder about transfer of ownership, can you unregister your #?
908109002206314500,Wed Sep 13 23:23:52 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 Preferably silver hahaha
908108845964316700,Wed Sep 13 23:23:15 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 Yeah, tell me about it. I'll go for what I can get on day one, I have a feeling Silver will be easier but who knows.
908108721506660400,Wed Sep 13 23:22:45 +0000 2017,Interesting that Apple killed the GPS only models of Watch and Watch Edition. All of them have Cellular. Is it req'd to have service?
908108553696759800,Wed Sep 13 23:22:05 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 Yeah, it's really pretty. Almost white but has a nice metallic sheen to it. Better than Gray imo.
908108357596262400,Wed Sep 13 23:21:18 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 So glad it doesn't have a white front!
908108216076251100,Wed Sep 13 23:20:45 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 Plus, it's a lot easier to polish bare stainless steel! The SG will start fading if you polish it. Silver… https://t.co/pN622TIqLk
908108062149500900,Wed Sep 13 23:20:08 +0000 2017,@Dman2582 Apple always picks the most eye catching for marketing. It's all Silver.
908103904411504600,Wed Sep 13 23:03:37 +0000 2017,If the iPhone 8 had a black front, I'd buy silver too. Might try the gold.... naw. SG.
908103777940631600,Wed Sep 13 23:03:07 +0000 2017,I'm convinced that silver is a pretty color on the X. It reminds me of my first white iPhone.. the 4S ;)
908077850774921200,Wed Sep 13 21:20:05 +0000 2017,Pretty shocked that people want SG than Silver. I think Silver looks really good... like the silver S8!
908077462600536000,Wed Sep 13 21:18:33 +0000 2017,@Gbalaz Ouch :(
908034429238554600,Wed Sep 13 18:27:33 +0000 2017,@SnazzyQ I think I'm leaning silver too. It looks borderline white and with a black front, it's fire. If the iPhone… https://t.co/KkIpldWdQM
908034241627336700,Wed Sep 13 18:26:48 +0000 2017,@SnazzyQ I will say Silver will be easier to polish (the stainless steel is naked rather than coated).

833327387542769700,Sun Feb 19 14:48:26 +0000 2017,Pretty incredible, right? Still shocks me every time I see a landing. The dynamics problem is just enormous.
833327151428595700,Sun Feb 19 14:47:30 +0000 2017,Falcon has landed.
833326873354629100,Sun Feb 19 14:46:23 +0000 2017,Landing a few moments away
833326675177984000,Sun Feb 19 14:45:36 +0000 2017,Entry burn will slow down Falcon 9 to prevent excessive heat/damage.
833326048003629000,Sun Feb 19 14:43:06 +0000 2017,Stage 1 now falling back to Earth. Will begin re-entry burn in a bit.
833325794625716200,Sun Feb 19 14:42:06 +0000 2017,Stage one about to boost back to coast of FL.
833325736123580400,Sun Feb 19 14:41:52 +0000 2017,Stage 2 up and going.
833325705404510200,Sun Feb 19 14:41:45 +0000 2017,Good stage sep.
833325651981643800,Sun Feb 19 14:41:32 +0000 2017,MECO = Main Engine Cut Off.
833325528027426800,Sun Feb 19 14:41:02 +0000 2017,MVac Chill = LOX being chilled down in the second stage.
833325455075848200,Sun Feb 19 14:40:45 +0000 2017,Also happens right around Mach 1.
833325367066779600,Sun Feb 19 14:40:24 +0000 2017,Max q = maximum dynamic pressure, basically the max amount of pressure of air pushing back on structure.
833325236808466400,Sun Feb 19 14:39:53 +0000 2017,Darn clouds.
833325105979732000,Sun Feb 19 14:39:22 +0000 2017,Cleared the tower.
833324980779745300,Sun Feb 19 14:38:52 +0000 2017,Pressing for flight = pressure building up to flight levels.
833324863762866200,Sun Feb 19 14:38:24 +0000 2017,LD has given the okay to launch. We’re a go.
833324773954486300,Sun Feb 19 14:38:03 +0000 2017,Venting = normal ;)
833324227977699300,Sun Feb 19 14:35:53 +0000 2017,When you burn LH2 (Liquid Hydrogen) and LOX, you get a clear-blue-ish flame with little to no smoke trail. (Like the Space Shuttle's mains)
833324034792243200,Sun Feb 19 14:35:06 +0000 2017,Fun fact #3: When you burn RPL (Kerosene) and LOX (Liquid Oxygen), you get a bright yellow flame with a long smoke trail.
833323887316328400,Sun Feb 19 14:34:31 +0000 2017,Falcon 9 is a go for launch. Make sure to check out the livestream!
833319194481590300,Sun Feb 19 14:15:52 +0000 2017,@techlover86 Yes!
833319072867696600,Sun Feb 19 14:15:23 +0000 2017,Fun fact #2: Falcon 9 first stage will attempt to land at LZ-1 today rather than OCISLY.
833315394198835200,Sun Feb 19 14:00:46 +0000 2017,Fun fact: Launch Pad 39A is where the Saturn V launched from. And the Space Shuttle.
832995045968076800,Sat Feb 18 16:47:49 +0000 2017,Thrust vectoring is vital for spacecraft success and to be placed in the correct orbit. Better safe than sorry. #24hrreset
