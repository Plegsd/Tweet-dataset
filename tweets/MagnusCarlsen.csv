214468310320939000,Sun Jun 17 21:23:24 +0000 2012,Really disappointing draw today, vs Tomashevsky. Had a big advantage in the middlegame, then blundered badly and could not win after 7 hours
214056111114960900,Sat Jun 16 18:05:28 +0000 2012,Uneventful draw vs Nakamura today, but nevertheless moved into shared first place with 4/7 as leaders Kramnik and Morozevich lost
212579321771065340,Tue Jun 12 16:17:14 +0000 2012,White vs Grischuk today. Felt I had an advantage in a very complicated middlegame. Got out of hand and was happy to force a draw at the end
211524848193765380,Sat Jun 09 18:27:08 +0000 2012,Blundered again in the opening vs Morozevich today. Was an uphill battle after that, but managed to make a draw after a lot of suffering

211126042851688450,Fri Jun 08 16:02:25 +0000 2012,Blundered in the opening today, and lucky to escape with a draw vs Kramnik. Morozevich tomorrow
210797404922982400,Thu Jun 07 18:16:32 +0000 2012,Played well first five rounds, then rather erratic, but was great fun, and very happy to get five whites :)
210796648794832900,Thu Jun 07 18:13:32 +0000 2012,6.5/9 was enough for shared first place with Morozevich. He had the better tiebreak, so I'll be playing Kramnik, who surprisingly was 9. tmo

137977369565728770,Sat Nov 19 19:35:43 +0000 2011,Could not make anything of a huge advantage today. Karjakin defended really well after I spoiled my position right before move 40.
137626352173056000,Fri Nov 18 20:20:53 +0000 2011,Draw vs Kramnik in another insanely complicated game today. Didn't see Bc8 at the end, would have played on if I had.
137226107035455490,Thu Nov 17 17:50:28 +0000 2011,Extremely complicated and difficult game today. Very glad to have come out on top after Gelfand lost the thread at the end. Kramnik tomorrow

122830870963953660,Sun Oct 09 00:28:56 +0000 2011,Now within striking distance and fully motivated to face Ivanchuk with white after the free day!
122830606588588030,Sun Oct 09 00:27:53 +0000 2011,Vallejo was kind enough to return the favour and blunder a piece. In case you hadn't noticed, that's how games are decided at the top level.
122035886400606200,Thu Oct 06 19:49:57 +0000 2011,Could not make anything of a slight advantage against Anand today, another draw #headache
121232446384635900,Tue Oct 04 14:37:22 +0000 2011,@JimNorton you have many talents, but chess is perhaps not one of them.
120266734321139710,Sat Oct 01 22:39:58 +0000 2011,Beat Ivanchuk today, now anything is possible in Bilbao! Not a great game by any means, but I could not care less about that right now.
119188244347879420,Wed Sep 28 23:14:26 +0000 2011,But to serve pizza without cheese to unsuspecting customers is simply a crime against humanity @gmjlh
119187676330070020,Wed Sep 28 23:12:11 +0000 2011,Well, to unnecessarily drift into time trouble and lose a winning position in a few moves is of course outrageous.
118864730453573630,Wed Sep 28 01:48:54 +0000 2011,Meanwhile, in the ECC Gelfand may have won the game of the day, but move of the day is certainly 15. Nb1 in Shirov-Rodshtein
118861448645591040,Wed Sep 28 01:35:52 +0000 2011,Not really satisfied with my play today, but Aronian nevertheless had to work a bit for a draw, which he secured convincingly enough
118432015602286600,Mon Sep 26 21:09:27 +0000 2011,White against Aronian next. Aronian got lost on his way to the cube today, I'll try to make him get lost in the complications tomorrow
118430772704182270,Mon Sep 26 21:04:31 +0000 2011,Comfortable draw with black against Anand today in a Berlin
118022058323087360,Sun Sep 25 18:00:26 +0000 2011,Black against Anand in the first round in Sao Paulo tomorrow. A little bummed out about not getting my usual double white at the start

111940826346692600,Thu Sep 08 23:15:47 +0000 2011,@BhavikMakan It most certainly would! I just don't think it's very likely. On the other hand, didn't think she'd get past Karjakin either
111938720139186180,Thu Sep 08 23:07:25 +0000 2011,@albertovmelo Incredibly exciting match! I think Judit won deservedly in the end
111938277296181250,Thu Sep 08 23:05:39 +0000 2011,@BhavikMakan Hard to pick one, especially as I am usually wrong about these things. Gut feeling says Grischuk or Ponomariov
111936577827115000,Thu Sep 08 22:58:54 +0000 2011,Great time @ simul with my sponsor Arctic today. One opponent was aided by a homemade chess engine. Won that game as well as the rest
111934197106606080,Thu Sep 08 22:49:26 +0000 2011,Pono pulled through in typical style, beating Bruzon in blitz in the end. Don't think he'll be easy to stop now...
111933948103368700,Thu Sep 08 22:48:27 +0000 2011,Sick tiebreaks in the world cup today. Heine busted, but fought admirably against Gashimov, winning on demand twice in great style

110084869169758200,Sat Sep 03 20:20:52 +0000 2011,Just about everything went wrong today, leaving me with the less than impressive score of 0/3. Still, a very enjoyable event
109657829853495300,Fri Sep 02 16:03:58 +0000 2011,Happy with 1.5/3 with two black games today. Blew winning positions with  blunders vs Aronian and Anand, that'll have to change tomorrow!
