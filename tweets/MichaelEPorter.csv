747903790200696800,Tue Jun 28 21:25:33 +0000 2016,The concept of "bundled payments" is not esoteric. It is not a theory. This is happening right now, all over the world. #HBRwebinar

747893676358123500,Tue Jun 28 20:45:22 +0000 2016,The bundled payment drives integrated treatment, because a team takes responsibility for the seamless care process. #HBRwebinar
747893339668746200,Tue Jun 28 20:44:02 +0000 2016,What is value? It depends on the condition &amp; desirable outcomes  e.g. being able to walk with a hip replacement. Value is not subjective.
747891410041442300,Tue Jun 28 20:36:21 +0000 2016,We have to measure both the outcomes we're achieving and the costs. This measurement has been relatively rare in health care. #HBRwebinar
