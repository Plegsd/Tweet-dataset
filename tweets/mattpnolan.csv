400644295835000800,Wed Nov 13 15:20:18 +0000 2013,@UbisoftUK Honestly, I didn't play the original until AC2 was out. I then played both back to back. I enjoyed the first, in that context.

400626499725717500,Wed Nov 13 14:09:35 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm Yeah, I'm playing with a controller through Steam. Anyway, sorry for all the Tweets, but it's nice to have these convos. :)
400621871621627900,Wed Nov 13 13:51:12 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm I'd like Guacamelee more if it was about traversing the world and doing puzzles...not the difficult combat and platforming.
400621640385445900,Wed Nov 13 13:50:16 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm Which is why I have never had the desire to play Super Meat Boy and have been staying away from Spelunky. :P
400621496264962050,Wed Nov 13 13:49:42 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm I just don't have fun with mechanics like that and don't feel any satisfaction after completing difficult parts...
400621284960108540,Wed Nov 13 13:48:52 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm Okay. Played more Guac today and almost broke my controller when doing wall jumps and having to also alternate dimensions...
400466807678459900,Wed Nov 13 03:35:01 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm I'll likely finish unless I get too frustrated like Xtabay almost made me...It's just not a game I keep Wanting to go back to
400465589954564100,Wed Nov 13 03:30:11 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm And while the setting and art is fun in a lot of ways, it is also bland in places (some backgrounds and some "floors").
400465220524458000,Wed Nov 13 03:28:43 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm I think my biggest issue with Guac is that I feel a lot of the hard combat is cheap. It feels too "skatey."
400464933105578000,Wed Nov 13 03:27:34 +0000 2013,@FinalMacstorm Admission...I never played Metroid...I had a Genesis and haven't been able to get back to playing it...So, that's one thing.

400334484563714050,Tue Nov 12 18:49:13 +0000 2013,@greg_pikitis I meant no offense. I only wanted to clarify, because I'd prefer a bee and just wanted to check as I could have been wrong. :)
400296616281645060,Tue Nov 12 16:18:45 +0000 2013,@BrianPShea Yeah, totally fair. I do wonder if "Steam Box" could lead to PCs compared more as another "console" option but probably not. :)
400293435376431100,Tue Nov 12 16:06:06 +0000 2013,@BrianPShea Def great games...and arguably the best of consoles, depending on taste, but I honestly feel that PC has better for my tastes :)

1445767171,Fri Apr 03 15:06:07 +0000 2009,@brian_dailey How are you doing? How is traveling? I guess you are still in TN now.  I'm going to read that article you posted. I'm curious.
1445661789,Fri Apr 03 14:48:30 +0000 2009,Tomahawk "Anonymous" is almost putting me into a meditative coma. (Weird that this is my second twitter on this band...)
1444646446,Fri Apr 03 11:18:56 +0000 2009,@AlexRGardner  I still have never watched that show.  I also need to watch Lost, Heroes, and Battlestar.  Too much SC to watch, though... :)
1444643746,Fri Apr 03 11:18:04 +0000 2009,@jonathanzila How was the flight?  Say Aloha to my family for me. ;)

1434876585,Wed Apr 01 23:22:42 +0000 2009,@ilyenasunhair Tracy once sent me the link to that comic about fight scenes in your head, because I had told him before that I did it. :)
1434869943,Wed Apr 01 23:21:27 +0000 2009,I hate it when I'm behind a slow person and they pause for a second at the top of the stairs. Have you never walked down stairs before?!
1434093072,Wed Apr 01 21:08:33 +0000 2009,Busy day at work, but I'm hoping at least 1 of the 3 keyboards I bought online was delivered today. :)
1431649332,Wed Apr 01 14:33:57 +0000 2009,I'm not a fan of No Doubt, but their VH1 "Complete History" is an enjoyable watch. http://tinyurl.com/d4u23d
1431575330,Wed Apr 01 14:21:21 +0000 2009,Another day with my mind on at least three things at any given time: work, my article for this week, and my beautiful, amazing girl.

1418520997,Mon Mar 30 16:01:57 +0000 2009,@AlexRGardner For reals.  They need to set rules on how often a tournament can run in a certain amount of time.  Oh well. :)
1418453841,Mon Mar 30 15:50:44 +0000 2009,Not too tired today, and that's always a good thing on a Monday, especially since I have writing to do tonight.
