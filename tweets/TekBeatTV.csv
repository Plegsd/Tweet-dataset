281785547696001020,Thu Dec 20 15:38:04 +0000 2012,RT @Joe_Weisjt: @TekBeatTV google maps is clearly the best maps app, in both data and ui.
281782716171681800,Thu Dec 20 15:26:49 +0000 2012,@DetroitBORG Dang Mike, you may have a problem haha ;)
281781052282912770,Thu Dec 20 15:20:12 +0000 2012,@techtodaywithcj Same here, feels quicker in response as well and more accurate than the built in and other apps.
281779137939664900,Thu Dec 20 15:12:36 +0000 2012,How many of you guys have changed your usage to Google Maps app on iOS? I know I have lol, it's definitely the better app in my opinion

281415431082893300,Wed Dec 19 15:07:21 +0000 2012,Apologize for the delay in vids guys, have some personal matters to tend to plus CES 2013 prep so it's taking a lot of my time.
278909385940557820,Wed Dec 12 17:09:14 +0000 2012,Now if only I had a TV in my house that wasn't SMART enabled...so I could test this out lol http://t.co/A3rhpsH1
278710175869833200,Wed Dec 12 03:57:38 +0000 2012,@MacMike1000 That's just one of the rumored names for Apple's TV they are saying they'll release at some point ;)
278710027848646660,Wed Dec 12 03:57:03 +0000 2012,@BloodElectronic No prob, anytime! :)
278697186643021820,Wed Dec 12 03:06:01 +0000 2012,@BloodElectronic My suggestion would be to go for it if you're in need of one right now :)
278697125838209020,Wed Dec 12 03:05:47 +0000 2012,@BloodElectronic Yup it's still running strong, honestly I prefer it over the Halo 4 console, especially the controllers. More durable.
278696234015916030,Wed Dec 12 03:02:14 +0000 2012,One can only hope that not just the software and interactivity are great on the new TV, but if the panel was great too? $$$ SCORE
278696092927934460,Wed Dec 12 03:01:41 +0000 2012,Honestly speaking though, depending on who makes the panels for Apple when they do out their new TV, they could have a real winner.
278695933548584960,Wed Dec 12 03:01:03 +0000 2012,@UnboxTherapy Your Tuesday night drive around town car? ;)
278695799171452930,Wed Dec 12 03:00:31 +0000 2012,Based on their own selective survey Morgan Stanley says that Apple will sell 13 million "iTV's" in just the US...who cares take my money!
277458725789397000,Sat Dec 08 17:04:49 +0000 2012,Gotta love waking up to emails from UPS and Fedex that a bunch of stuff is delivering next week sweeeeet haha

264910833589563400,Sun Nov 04 02:03:59 +0000 2012,@DarGadgetZ But the processor I think is showing it's age, getting a bit of lag between screen swipes sometimes
264910747455324160,Sun Nov 04 02:03:38 +0000 2012,@DarGadgetZ Yea if I try to spot out the issues I can tell especially with text. But not enough to hinder the usage of it of course.

264405191820988400,Fri Nov 02 16:34:44 +0000 2012,What do you guys think? Has Apple lost it's edge and innovation?
264405009188401150,Fri Nov 02 16:34:01 +0000 2012,So it looks like the lines of people at Apple stores was shorter than expected which in turn lead to the again drop in AAPL stock price eep

249271214579781630,Fri Sep 21 22:17:43 +0000 2012,@ThatTechShow @DetroitBORG true that
249271157000392700,Fri Sep 21 22:17:29 +0000 2012,@DetroitBORG I know but the one thing that bugs me is the chrome beze :(
249271005493723140,Fri Sep 21 22:16:53 +0000 2012,Make sure to keep an eye out for those random Japan pics that go up on twitter when I'm there.
249270873578684400,Fri Sep 21 22:16:22 +0000 2012,But there is going to be a review after I test this thing out on my Japan trip I'm going on tomorrow. Stay tuned for that when I get back!
249270668007464960,Fri Sep 21 22:15:33 +0000 2012,Sorry guys no unboxing this time around, I think you guys are good with the ones out there ;).
249205921560014850,Fri Sep 21 17:58:16 +0000 2012,@duncan33303 Congrats on the new D600 man, even though I'm a Canon guy, it's still a great full frame
249153271288172540,Fri Sep 21 14:29:03 +0000 2012,You know something is popular when they are stolen on the first day they are released http://t.co/ZPWxOtU5
249149548579139600,Fri Sep 21 14:14:16 +0000 2012,@mtpflyers Congrats on the new kid by the way Mike!

249002523946516480,Fri Sep 21 04:30:02 +0000 2012,@Nabatron Nice apparently same here
249002485988085760,Fri Sep 21 04:29:53 +0000 2012,@scarboy6693 haha I don't think I'd go that far.
249002227866415100,Fri Sep 21 04:28:52 +0000 2012,RT @MKBHD: Tonight's video is now on Reddit for your sharing pleasure! http://t.co/a9J6MWAD
248917757326921730,Thu Sep 20 22:53:12 +0000 2012,@iamjoonlee yup when you're loaded anything is possible, but some things are just plain crazy haha
248917673008853000,Thu Sep 20 22:52:52 +0000 2012,@scarboy6693 haha same here
248914825873338370,Thu Sep 20 22:41:33 +0000 2012,Damn Wozniak is super dedicated to fly to Brisbane to grab the iPhone 5 in line crazy!
248913817214529540,Thu Sep 20 22:37:33 +0000 2012,@SchneiderMac haha ic
248913773799301120,Thu Sep 20 22:37:22 +0000 2012,@Nabatron Not surprisingly as the tracking for both is not really up to date. You most likely will grab it tomorrow.
248912989296685060,Thu Sep 20 22:34:15 +0000 2012,@UnboxTherapy Nice
248565333529620480,Wed Sep 19 23:32:48 +0000 2012,@joeKIMBAP Good idea, doubt there will be a design change. Then you can reap the rewards of a revamped OS and design rolled up in one
248565157767307260,Wed Sep 19 23:32:06 +0000 2012,@iamjoonlee @Keaton Yup, surprised they still have no way to minimize the grey market products
248564966528000000,Wed Sep 19 23:31:20 +0000 2012,@Keaton Grey market in Asia prices
248564395809046530,Wed Sep 19 23:29:04 +0000 2012,@joeKIMBAP Yea me too most likely the new revamp will come in the next iteration because the next iPhone will have minimal design changes
248564274610466800,Wed Sep 19 23:28:35 +0000 2012,@jman837 lol
248563950889865200,Wed Sep 19 23:27:18 +0000 2012,On a unrelated note at least you can grab a grey market iPhone 5 for the low low price of $1100 lol
248563851912679420,Wed Sep 19 23:26:55 +0000 2012,@joeKIMBAP I expected as much, that's a shame :(
248563611981733900,Wed Sep 19 23:25:57 +0000 2012,@SchneiderMac @DudeFromUkraine Congrats Nir lol super early then
248563009792917500,Wed Sep 19 23:23:34 +0000 2012,So how has the new iOS6 been treating everyone? Good? Bad? Blew up?
248457512372797440,Wed Sep 19 16:24:21 +0000 2012,@Nabatron Maybe try the same method in Fedex
248457439408697340,Wed Sep 19 16:24:04 +0000 2012,@DudeFromUkraine @SchneiderMac No prob, congrats! :)
248427904185286660,Wed Sep 19 14:26:42 +0000 2012,@insanely_great whoa I wouldn't go that far haha
248427261294944260,Wed Sep 19 14:24:09 +0000 2012,@insanely_great that actually wouldn't be a bad idea...
248423332754632700,Wed Sep 19 14:08:32 +0000 2012,@iTechEveryWeek Should still work, unless it's shipping via Fedex
248422497354137600,Wed Sep 19 14:05:13 +0000 2012,@Nabatron yea as long as it is tied to your apple phone # it should pop up unless yours is shipping via Fedex
248422370262536200,Wed Sep 19 14:04:43 +0000 2012,@DudeFromUkraine @TekBeatTV Well if yours is UPS, go to track by reference, use your apple phone # for the ref # entry and track it :)
248422236468441100,Wed Sep 19 14:04:11 +0000 2012,@SchneiderMac @DudeFromUkraine They're using both apparently this time around, just luck of the draw UPS is shipping mine
248421977671471100,Wed Sep 19 14:03:09 +0000 2012,@MKBHD lol
248218081992773630,Wed Sep 19 00:32:57 +0000 2012,@DetroitBORG Can you make sure to make a part deux for the adapter ;)

248217878250274800,Wed Sep 19 00:32:08 +0000 2012,@insanely_great @tldtoday Some are shipping via Fedex apparently so you might need to do the same thing with Fedex
248217762139340800,Wed Sep 19 00:31:40 +0000 2012,@iTechEveryWeek @tldtoday make sure it's the itunes account phone number
248217661740294140,Wed Sep 19 00:31:16 +0000 2012,@Nabatron is it the nubmer tied to your itunes account?
248165684318711800,Tue Sep 18 21:04:44 +0000 2012,@Nabatron You have to enter it in the "reference #" field, there's no field named cell # ;)
248165534384930800,Tue Sep 18 21:04:08 +0000 2012,@West_Syed Yup probably your best bet, just make sure you grab that Applecare+ within 30 days if you need it after that it's a nogo
248165367573270530,Tue Sep 18 21:03:28 +0000 2012,Glad the phone is coming on Friday, cause I'm leaving for Japan Saturday, perfect time to test the phone out overseas haha
248164746761752580,Tue Sep 18 21:01:00 +0000 2012,@West_Syed @tldtoday @mrkrazy1870 They definitely do carry a stock for people that wait in line...but this time around might want tobe early
248164615106723840,Tue Sep 18 21:00:29 +0000 2012,@tldtoday No prob anytime!
248162409938821120,Tue Sep 18 20:51:43 +0000 2012,@Nabatron Just go to UPS, do track by reference. Type your cell #, country and zip code and enter ;)
248162146221969400,Tue Sep 18 20:50:40 +0000 2012,@duncan33303 Congrats man!
248162073811513340,Tue Sep 18 20:50:23 +0000 2012,@tldtoday Type in your cell phone #, country and zip code and it should pop up
248162008145473540,Tue Sep 18 20:50:08 +0000 2012,@tldtoday Just go to UPS (assume they'll be shipping via that method for you too) and go to track by reference
248159424408068100,Tue Sep 18 20:39:52 +0000 2012,@iLikeTech_ haha Nice! mine was there yesterday you're catching up lol

246267359344619520,Thu Sep 13 15:21:28 +0000 2012,@doubled50 You can check eligibility on the Apple store I believe they have it right on their order page
246267246463315970,Thu Sep 13 15:21:01 +0000 2012,@insanely_great @misha24 @doubled50 @igmbrian @nerfsqueezer @OmarCorrea Yea with 5 on a family plan they should be just giving you free ones

246266655032872960,Thu Sep 13 15:18:40 +0000 2012,Seems like the general public has mixed views on the new iPhone 5. What do you guys think about it? Not enough improvement/innovation?
245962996457820160,Wed Sep 12 19:12:02 +0000 2012,@West_Syed @tldtoday that would be really disappointing if that happened lol
245961304140046340,Wed Sep 12 19:05:19 +0000 2012,@insanely_great Knew it was going to be pricey lol

245952666604285950,Wed Sep 12 18:30:59 +0000 2012,@Ramaap I like the improvement minus the chrome but wish they would have changed up the design a bit more :(.
245952193637789700,Wed Sep 12 18:29:07 +0000 2012,@Ramaap honestly I like the anodized look on the back but I wish it was in the black anodized aluminum like new iPhone 5 black
245951808495837200,Wed Sep 12 18:27:35 +0000 2012,@DetroitBORG standby wake key? lol

245949974465093630,Wed Sep 12 18:20:18 +0000 2012,Gotta include a pic of the Nano inside a Beamer, just like Apple haha

245946621949530100,Wed Sep 12 18:06:58 +0000 2012,@Nabatron Not quite sure, from the demo looks like it's faster but still dual core, we'll have to see the specs online to be 100% sure
245946326876037120,Wed Sep 12 18:05:48 +0000 2012,@Shockwave22 I would too if it weren't for the fact that I would have to give up my unlimited data lol

245182324944293900,Mon Sep 10 15:29:56 +0000 2012,4G LTE will be a welcome feature on the iPhone 5…maybe it’ll be time for me to switch over to Verizon, what do you guys think?

244106329004843000,Fri Sep 07 16:14:18 +0000 2012,@duncan33303 My thoughts exactly, honestly I'm more interested in the Kindle PaperWhite than the HD lol. Is that sad?
244105513128824830,Fri Sep 07 16:11:04 +0000 2012,I seriously hope they got all the issues cleaned up in this revision
244105430698172400,Fri Sep 07 16:10:44 +0000 2012,On a semi-related note, what do you guys think of the new Kindle Fire HD? The last kindle fire came out of the box DOA lol

228248194704871420,Wed Jul 25 21:59:44 +0000 2012,Although its a bummer that they removed Lion from the App Store, wonder why they were in such a hurry to remove it
228248051423248400,Wed Jul 25 21:59:10 +0000 2012,Looks like the general feeling towards Mountain Lion is that it’s running better, same here (few glitches but expected).

218931532314841100,Sat Jun 30 04:58:39 +0000 2012,New vid is uploading now, get psyched! Pretty interesting product, one that I'll most likely make part of my bag o tricks going forward
218924496273424400,Sat Jun 30 04:30:41 +0000 2012,@scottjedwards More like a #firstworldproblem haha

218916270702215170,Sat Jun 30 03:58:00 +0000 2012,And sorry guys for the lack of vids, just been a lot going on and have been sick for the last week. I'm suffering from YouTube withdrawal

217272816934977540,Mon Jun 25 15:07:30 +0000 2012,The Ret display would have been really sweet though haha.
217272756776083460,Mon Jun 25 15:07:16 +0000 2012,Also interesting to find out that the next iMac will probably not have a retina display, at least it'll get hardware bumps.
217268912453201920,Mon Jun 25 14:52:00 +0000 2012,Sorry guys, been feeling under the weather all weekend. I'll be back up and running soon. WIll try for a vid tonight.
215606430722564100,Thu Jun 21 00:45:53 +0000 2012,Sorry guys just got back from work and not feeling so hot. Vid needs to be pushed. Stick with me last few months have been rough lol

215222568951619600,Tue Jun 19 23:20:33 +0000 2012,Man this week has been crazy already and it's only getting crazier...it's only Tuesday!
215221335557816320,Tue Jun 19 23:15:39 +0000 2012,@DetroitBORG that’s probably coming out at some point! Get your wallet ready!
213270351575138300,Thu Jun 14 14:03:08 +0000 2012,Pretty horrible dream last night...I dreamt that Apple updated the Mac Pro and put minimal spec upgrades...oh wait...
212952869501022200,Wed Jun 13 17:01:35 +0000 2012,@insanely_great I want support for nvidia 6xx because the closest support they have is a generation old 570 I believe (I need the latest hah
212952717205831680,Wed Jun 13 17:00:58 +0000 2012,@insanely_great critical only because I want the latest and greatest when it comes to building a hack pro
212940928917315600,Wed Jun 13 16:14:08 +0000 2012,@insanely_great lol very true!

212940068841730050,Wed Jun 13 16:10:43 +0000 2012,@insanely_great good decision 4GB is just so sad lol, now if only they would up it to 16...
212938629876682750,Wed Jun 13 16:05:00 +0000 2012,@tldtoday sweet deal, getting back into the swing of things is always the first step

212935430088298500,Wed Jun 13 15:52:17 +0000 2012,@Bobo4Heat @DetroitBORG @tldtoday it was so sad and recieved such bad publicity that they removed the "new" tag on the apple store page
212935309959241730,Wed Jun 13 15:51:48 +0000 2012,@Unboxtherapy I got a favor Lew I need you to unbox this http://t.co/DwqxBzCe
212934338969481200,Wed Jun 13 15:47:57 +0000 2012,@TechTechMan Combination Mac Mini/Macbook Air
212934270690406400,Wed Jun 13 15:47:40 +0000 2012,@TechTechMan With regards to the Air, I think that thing would be amazing if they only bumped up the RAM to 16 and it got a ret display
212933908831027200,Wed Jun 13 15:46:14 +0000 2012,@TechSmartt haven't recieved it yet will get back to you once it comes through
212933801427484670,Wed Jun 13 15:45:49 +0000 2012,@TechTechMan yea saw it, it's a long way off haha. Now I'm just thinking "I'll believe it when I see it" lol
212933301525164030,Wed Jun 13 15:43:49 +0000 2012,@TechTechMan sadly yes lol
212933054455488500,Wed Jun 13 15:42:50 +0000 2012,@TechTechMan nothing yet lol still not convinced it's what I need lol. The screen is not enough to sway me to dump the cash
212932114621018100,Wed Jun 13 15:39:06 +0000 2012,@tldtoday glad you're back up and running man
212931869229072400,Wed Jun 13 15:38:08 +0000 2012,@TechSmartt interesting response that's the day before the day I hate so I'm not a huge fan of Sunday either haha
212930992053301250,Wed Jun 13 15:34:39 +0000 2012,I've reached the middle of the week, weekend here I come. What's your favorite day of the week? (I know everyone hates Monday haha)
212930751656763400,Wed Jun 13 15:33:41 +0000 2012,@Bobo4Heat @DetroitBORG @tldtoday now I've turned to the response of "I'll believe it when I see it" lol
212338029757607940,Tue Jun 12 00:18:26 +0000 2012,@ThatTechShow no doubt
212333677655490560,Tue Jun 12 00:01:08 +0000 2012,@ThatTechShow yup a part of me died inside lol
212332171669680130,Mon Jun 11 23:55:09 +0000 2012,@ThatTechShow A 650m just does not cut it for me especially at that price. Retina is definitely nice but not a priority for me, need power
212331954648006660,Mon Jun 11 23:54:17 +0000 2012,@ThatTechShow Still debating honestly for my personal use I might go Hackintosh as the specs for the new retina MBP is underwhelming for me
212330401056829440,Mon Jun 11 23:48:07 +0000 2012,@ThatTechShow @DetroitBORG @tldtoday Depends on what you need man, if you are dying for the retina display I'd wait, save and go base ret
212310028684759040,Mon Jun 11 22:27:10 +0000 2012,@MKBHD @tldtoday @duncan33303 Don't depress yourself any further by looking through the specs...lol
212309070441492480,Mon Jun 11 22:23:21 +0000 2012,@MKBHD @tldtoday @duncan33303 after seeing that update on the Mac Pro I can't sleep now haha
212308972089249800,Mon Jun 11 22:22:58 +0000 2012,@tldtoday @MKBHD @duncan33303 ROFL that is truly a talent Apple has to kill something without actually killing it
212308866480877570,Mon Jun 11 22:22:32 +0000 2012,@MKBHD @duncan33303 Yea hoping it's a typo but I doubt it. Maybe they're really going to EOL it...that would really suck
212308744019771400,Mon Jun 11 22:22:03 +0000 2012,@duncan33303 lol not enough to make up for that FAIL of a vid card listing
212308613040050180,Mon Jun 11 22:21:32 +0000 2012,@duncan33303 yea not sure what Apple is thinking even if it's a typo I'm not happy with it even being a 6770 lol where's the quadro card?!
212308454323400700,Mon Jun 11 22:20:54 +0000 2012,@Shockwave22 hahaha
212307392979931140,Mon Jun 11 22:16:41 +0000 2012,Still seriously RAGE quitting about the vid card they put on the Mac Pro update...seriously what were you thinkin apple!?
212306889298542600,Mon Jun 11 22:14:41 +0000 2012,@lgreenberg lol in the end it's all about the numbers and what you personally put priorities on that's my motto
212306695911780350,Mon Jun 11 22:13:55 +0000 2012,@lgreenberg I would go option 1 if those were my two choices only because it's a better deal especially if you don't care about retina
212305913862832130,Mon Jun 11 22:10:48 +0000 2012,@DudeFromUkraine @schneidermac @thejasontsay Extra dough can always be had if you got the extra organs ;) lol

212267525369643000,Mon Jun 11 19:38:16 +0000 2012,@tldtoday my thoughts exactly why update and stick a two generation old vid card in it…
212266842947993600,Mon Jun 11 19:35:33 +0000 2012,@TechTechMan yea so it’s true only ATI 5770…

212239360219820030,Mon Jun 11 17:46:21 +0000 2012,@Nabatron Doubt it, that's a fall thing. Only thing I can think of is if they do a One More Thing it'll be the Mac Pro
212239224559247360,Mon Jun 11 17:45:49 +0000 2012,@dougmorton @tldtoday REALLY silent lol
212238992001871870,Mon Jun 11 17:44:53 +0000 2012,@tldtoday Sooo Apple about that Mac Pro...lol
212238707573534720,Mon Jun 11 17:43:45 +0000 2012,Hmm $2199 not bad but first thought is that's a high base price, but again you get a lot hmmm
212238416862122000,Mon Jun 11 17:42:36 +0000 2012,@insanely_great I'm leaning towards high only because they kept the original Macbook Pro's in case you're looking to spend less
212238087709929470,Mon Jun 11 17:41:17 +0000 2012,@Zricon15 @MKBHD haha I'm more of a royal blue man myself
212237971565457400,Mon Jun 11 17:40:50 +0000 2012,@PDTalkinTech I would prefer to upgrade that stuff aftermarket due to their memory markups.
212237784428183550,Mon Jun 11 17:40:05 +0000 2012,@DetroitBORG I think they just discontinued the 17" sales were pretty bad on them I think
212237681999085570,Mon Jun 11 17:39:41 +0000 2012,Man I seriously hope the RAM is not soldered on...those pictures are a bit decieving...
212237488322916350,Mon Jun 11 17:38:55 +0000 2012,@MKBHD matte black...gimme lol

176375755738066940,Sun Mar 04 18:37:11 +0000 2012,@uriel_us Only trick I know of is draining it completely and charge and restart then. If that does not work, you're going to need to return.

146605253209489400,Tue Dec 13 14:59:50 +0000 2011,@FaisalSimply I hope earlier honestly, the 360 is great, but with regards to graphics, games are starting to already push the envelope.
146443377448202240,Tue Dec 13 04:16:36 +0000 2011,@jman837 Totally
146413018786435070,Tue Dec 13 02:15:58 +0000 2011,@MelonieMac Oh and I would totally get the Xbox 720 MW4 Edition Console too haha
146412496859840500,Tue Dec 13 02:13:54 +0000 2011,@TGITechday haha ;)
146412394770464770,Tue Dec 13 02:13:29 +0000 2011,@MelonieMac But I agree with that last tweet, it would be sweet if it did come out soon ;).
146412306673307650,Tue Dec 13 02:13:08 +0000 2011,@MelonieMac Yea I had heard it was going to be mentioned at CES 2012 (rumor), but there's also that "10 year lifespan" for the Xbox 360 talk
146404370530041860,Tue Dec 13 01:41:36 +0000 2011,So when's this Xbox 720 coming out, I'm ready for a new evolution to gaming!

146016562996985860,Mon Dec 12 00:00:36 +0000 2011,@PDTalkinTech Hmm not much on that front, really depends on what you find comfortable with. Vegas Pro is a good start.
146016422282276860,Mon Dec 12 00:00:02 +0000 2011,@UnboxTherapy I would use it for something big, that's what I'm using mine for ;)
146009999078998000,Sun Dec 11 23:34:31 +0000 2011,@PDTalkinTech @techieteengirl Still think the 300 HS will be better, more suitable aperture for better low light and wider shots.
146009485805240320,Sun Dec 11 23:32:28 +0000 2011,In case you missed my latest vid, Vapor Pro White Edition Review! http://t.co/sR2dAJW9 Hit that like & favorite like there's no tomorrow! ;)

144293614187581440,Wed Dec 07 05:54:13 +0000 2011,@luismacintosh Not sure what you mean, when I said top heavy I literally mean having the tablet be heavier than the keyboard etc ;).
144286482616680450,Wed Dec 07 05:25:52 +0000 2011,@luismacintosh Can't remember the exact date, but from the initial results in the industry, great product, but still suffers from issues.
144284241952378880,Wed Dec 07 05:16:58 +0000 2011,The Transformer Prime and dock would be great if it did not suffer from the same issue a clamcase etc. suffers, being top heavy :(.
144283965908467700,Wed Dec 07 05:15:52 +0000 2011,@weisjttechhouse ordered via macpartsonline (I think that's the name), but you can get the kit from ifixit if it's in stock.
144283549950935040,Wed Dec 07 05:14:13 +0000 2011,Ahh the joy of having a late night meeting...why do people setup meetings so late :(.

144110952835596290,Tue Dec 06 17:48:23 +0000 2011,@MelonieMac I would honestly say realistic/lower damage threshold while camping.
144057937759961090,Tue Dec 06 14:17:43 +0000 2011,@Jon4Lakers The insomnia club is probably the one club you don't wanna join :(.
144057668225601540,Tue Dec 06 14:16:39 +0000 2011,@MattNDeww Other than that you've got a unique profile and energy that makes you stand out, and well of course Dew! :)
144057550961254400,Tue Dec 06 14:16:11 +0000 2011,@MattNDeww For the vlog style videos try to create a steadycam (there's a few articles online on DIY steadycams), makes users dizzy :).
143825808740450300,Mon Dec 05 22:55:19 +0000 2011,@TechnoBuffalo Burn...one fruit to rule them all does not seem to apply in the real world I guess lol
143823443119448060,Mon Dec 05 22:45:55 +0000 2011,@weisjttechhouse And no complaints at all, works flawlessly and the build quality is great for the price :).
143819529556992000,Mon Dec 05 22:30:22 +0000 2011,@weisjttechhouse yup worked great. :).
143528774389075970,Mon Dec 05 03:15:01 +0000 2011,@jjbutler1111 @DetroitBORG @tldtoday I did a double take ;). Although I feel this might just get my hopes up and crush it later on.
143528339393626110,Mon Dec 05 03:13:17 +0000 2011,@scarboy6693 not a huge fan of it feels a lot less durable than a MacBook air. Also slow for a few things as it uses hybrid tech.
143524171538890750,Mon Dec 05 02:56:43 +0000 2011,@DetroitBORG @tldtoday excellente!
143489004468322300,Mon Dec 05 00:36:59 +0000 2011,@joshuachan72 I just used it without the dock adapter (the plastic thing you're referring to). HTH!
143379793839271940,Sun Dec 04 17:23:01 +0000 2011,@TGITechday On their site not really. But what you need to watch for is continuous versus strobe, for video you want continuous.
143379602759368700,Sun Dec 04 17:22:15 +0000 2011,@J_Giordano I think it was TUAW, I highly doubt it's true though, too quick.
143379489357971460,Sun Dec 04 17:21:48 +0000 2011,@Gregz0r haha yup rumor at the moment, I highly doubt it will happen either. At least I hope not, need time to save up to buy it ;).
143378251266535420,Sun Dec 04 17:16:53 +0000 2011,iPhone 5 in March? Hmmm...I'm out of organs to sell Apple what do you want me to do!?
143377699879133180,Sun Dec 04 17:14:42 +0000 2011,@TGITechday Np!
143355355676680200,Sun Dec 04 15:45:54 +0000 2011,@TGITechday Np. There is no "right" light, more like what you need for your environment. http://t.co/Rq8USbpi Good starter box kit ;) HTH!
143354918462427140,Sun Dec 04 15:44:10 +0000 2011,@joshuachan72 It worked with my iPhone 4. It does not explicitly say compatible with iPhone 4 but it mentions iPhone/iPod dock. HTH! :)

143156510351040510,Sun Dec 04 02:35:46 +0000 2011,@MervinGee Honestly yes especially if you hate having a bulky case which most extended battery cases do, add more weight.

140252960507703300,Sat Nov 26 02:18:06 +0000 2011,@MarkCooz Most likely they'll up the price especially with hybrid IS capability. I would expect $200-$300 more than current price.

123111572271927300,Sun Oct 09 19:04:20 +0000 2011,@TGITechday yup but it's due for an upgrade to the mark III

123052136270532600,Sun Oct 09 15:08:10 +0000 2011,@speakingoftech So when you use a 14 mm lens on a full frame it is 14 mm where as a cropped (depending on the DSLR) will be &gt; 14mm
123051924865032200,Sun Oct 09 15:07:19 +0000 2011,@speakingoftech Essentially it produces 35mm equivalent photos instead of a cropped portion.
123051735857111040,Sun Oct 09 15:06:34 +0000 2011,@myapplezone LOL did you find that secret SD card slot? That could be why haha.
123051579132743680,Sun Oct 09 15:05:57 +0000 2011,@ipodtouch2gbob That will put you in Point and Shoot territory…so I would recommend the Canon 300 HS

123051412765671420,Sun Oct 09 15:05:17 +0000 2011,@speakingoftech ROFL I did that too, now I go and play with the full frames in eager anticipation :)

123045972724027400,Sun Oct 09 14:43:40 +0000 2011,@rjhblog I hope not the 70D would be a cropped sensor DSLR while the D800 is a full frame :(.
123045889601310720,Sun Oct 09 14:43:20 +0000 2011,@speakingoftech Yea the main thing for me is I want a full frame to compete with the D800 :).
123045768297848830,Sun Oct 09 14:42:51 +0000 2011,@LogicallyTech Nah the D700 was a full frame DSLR while the 60D is a cropped ;)
123043975597789180,Sun Oct 09 14:35:44 +0000 2011,@rjhblog Yup I hope they announce the 5d Mark III but we'll see the Mark II is still selling well it's just they have to respond I think...
123038803001741310,Sun Oct 09 14:15:11 +0000 2011,I wonder how Canon will respond now that Nikon will be announcing D800 supposedly in November. Hope to see a Canon full frame before 2012.

122843749196894200,Sun Oct 09 01:20:06 +0000 2011,@TechTechMan has just proved again why ordering straight from Apple is usually the safer bet especially if you want your phone on launch day
122843598554267650,Sun Oct 09 01:19:30 +0000 2011,Interesting soooo informed by @TechTechMan make sure to verify with AT&T that yours delivers by the 14th…his will take 7-14 days
122842455598039040,Sun Oct 09 01:14:58 +0000 2011,@junoyeopTV No problem, yea I am not a huge fan of Nikon's autofocus (unless you have a fast focus lens), even then manual is better.
122842286345289730,Sun Oct 09 01:14:18 +0000 2011,@igmbrian It's easy just remember the acronym: SGSII w/W4G…wait ;)
122842105101029380,Sun Oct 09 01:13:34 +0000 2011,@junoyeopTV And also I usually do manual focus but you can do the zoom focus method as well (manual).
122842013539373060,Sun Oct 09 01:13:12 +0000 2011,@junoyeopTV Or set an aperture that is small enough to allow for greater depth of field to keep more stuff in focus.
122841938700402690,Sun Oct 09 01:12:55 +0000 2011,@junoyeopTV Since there's no autofocus (assume Canon) you're going to need to either preplan for distance (certain area always in focus)
122841122069413890,Sun Oct 09 01:09:40 +0000 2011,@junoyeopTV 1) Open aperture as high as possible 2) Get shutter to at least 60 2) Bump up ISO (try not to go past 1600 for video.
122840841231405060,Sun Oct 09 01:08:33 +0000 2011,@junoyeopTV Congrats man! All depends on setup honestly but for me steps are:
