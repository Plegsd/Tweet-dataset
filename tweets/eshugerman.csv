786634108948484100,Thu Oct 13 18:26:01 +0000 2016,When I finally chose to speak out publicly, it wasn‚Äôt for me. It was for an article about campus rape; an article I hoped would help end it.
786633910880829400,Thu Oct 13 18:25:13 +0000 2016,Once, I told my parents about what happened, as a hypothetical. ‚ÄúThat girl shouldn‚Äôt have been drunk and alone in his room,‚Äù my dad said.

786633257475375100,Thu Oct 13 18:22:38 +0000 2016,Many have questioned why these women waited so long to report. Trump himself cast doubt on them for this same reason.
786633151774810100,Thu Oct 13 18:22:12 +0000 2016,There‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been thinking about the last few days, seeing all these women forward with stories of being assaulted by Donald Trump
