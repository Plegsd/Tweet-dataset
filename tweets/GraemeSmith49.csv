711531481810780200,Sun Mar 20 12:34:59 +0000 2016,My thoughts on South Africa today : 1- phangiso should've played,2nd spinner crucial. 2- can't carry Morris and wiese need to pick one.
711468356130500600,Sun Mar 20 08:24:09 +0000 2016,I think #proteas should play phangiso today,give him game time before moving away from Mumbai and his role will become crucial with Tahir.
