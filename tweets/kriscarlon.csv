112105739367096320,Fri Sep 09 10:11:05 +0000 2011,Desert Mob show is good. Lots of colour. Not much sold.
112075749086867460,Fri Sep 09 08:11:55 +0000 2011,Just remembered my bizarre dream from last night: being in a crazy aerobatic helicopter flight that crashed, then turned out to be a ride...
112075145367126020,Fri Sep 09 08:09:31 +0000 2011,A little off-plan but the Desert Mob Symposium was sweet, intimate & genuine. And Bobby was a hit as always.
111986041266782200,Fri Sep 09 02:15:27 +0000 2011,Landed in Alice Springs finally!
111948356997230600,Thu Sep 08 23:45:42 +0000 2011,Ok, boarding now. Might still make sound check!
111946231470759940,Thu Sep 08 23:37:16 +0000 2011,Delayed in Darwin, Desert Mob Symposium in Alice starting without us.
111721325969670140,Thu Sep 08 08:43:34 +0000 2011,Just got off the plane, looked through the window at the pilot &he is wearing a hat like Robin Hood. Seriously. Like WTF!? #CrazyTerritory
111696275530981380,Thu Sep 08 07:04:01 +0000 2011,PS Didn't end up getting stabbed by the old man who said he was going to either, so that's good. Didn't even have to unsheath my knife!
111695770381586430,Thu Sep 08 07:02:01 +0000 2011,AGM - check. Drive to Maningrida - check. Get on a plane to Darwin - check.
111282132948762620,Wed Sep 07 03:38:22 +0000 2011,Power is off all afternoon so no more work today. If it wasn't our AGM tomorrow morning I'd be excited.
110852262431174660,Mon Sep 05 23:10:13 +0000 2011,Why the crows are extra noisy this morning: one of the dingo pups who stays in my yard is eating one. In front of the rest. That'll do it.
110632566150795260,Mon Sep 05 08:37:13 +0000 2011,So my pleasant day off at home turned into barneys at the art centre with cranky artists - that'll teach me to go into work on my day off!
110287302491770880,Sun Sep 04 09:45:16 +0000 2011,Was telling a friend about my epic nap & said I feel about my nap how that little kid on the internet feels about colouring in!
110239807434788860,Sun Sep 04 06:36:32 +0000 2011,What a day: a lazy morning in a dark cool room watching movies followed by a nap so long it was like another night's sleep! Perfecto
109879571297468420,Sat Sep 03 06:45:05 +0000 2011,So 4 carloads of tourists make a big fuss about the art centre being open for them & then only buy t-shirt. Last year's cheap t-shirts! WTF!
109602542085881860,Fri Sep 02 12:24:17 +0000 2011,Ramingining Festival!

109230226269159420,Thu Sep 01 11:44:50 +0000 2011,Lordy, what a day. Finally over
109118049029861380,Thu Sep 01 04:19:04 +0000 2011,Cutting trees, taxiing musicians, painting timber, designing logos, printing shirts, booking flights - just another morning at work

108107364485443580,Mon Aug 29 09:22:58 +0000 2011,Just realised the humor in the comment that (as a special treat) I've earned the right to go home (at 7 pm mind you) & have a 'night off'.
107953518383607800,Sun Aug 28 23:11:39 +0000 2011,Sweet home Ramingining, where the crows are so loud.

104496335117492220,Fri Aug 19 10:14:02 +0000 2011,So if a mouse has been eating your soap is it unhygienic to wash your hands with it?
104496136907268100,Fri Aug 19 10:13:15 +0000 2011,Still can't get over this new starter motor action. Starting the car has been a group activity since May
104490063123054600,Fri Aug 19 09:49:07 +0000 2011,Sad that instead of looking forward to the weekend for a life outside work I look forward to it for a life at work with no hassle.
104489771023347710,Fri Aug 19 09:47:57 +0000 2011,Ok, 11hrs of work &a whole ONE account is caught up with. That'll teach me to skip reconciling for 6weeks. At least it's the busiest account
