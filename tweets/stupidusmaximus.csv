665583404579074000,Sat Nov 14 17:33:44 +0000 2015,@sandygrains Selective questioning, yes. But - and I speak for myself - that's not the case here. @pierrefitter @bhavyakhanna @atti_cus
665583088718581800,Sat Nov 14 17:32:28 +0000 2015,@sandygrains Sorry, don't buy that questioning = extremism, passive or otherwise. @pierrefitter @f2000560 @bhavyakhanna @atti_cus
665579489485721600,Sat Nov 14 17:18:10 +0000 2015,@sarahbabar Not a comment on any community at all. Please read the tweets that followed. They may explain my position further.
665578110989922300,Sat Nov 14 17:12:42 +0000 2015,@pierrefitter And I despise that belief system too. Just don't see why I have to talk about it today. @f2000560 @bhavyakhanna @atti_cus
665577363598536700,Sat Nov 14 17:09:43 +0000 2015,@atti_cus Atheist too, which is why I shouldn't need to bring in Y when I talk about X and vice-versa. No special love/hatred for anyone.
665572030129934300,Sat Nov 14 16:48:32 +0000 2015,@bhavyakhanna @atti_cus I've seen this. Again, genuine question: how is this not whatabout-ery? And why is it wrong to question faith?
665571417832841200,Sat Nov 14 16:46:06 +0000 2015,@VidyaKrishnan Please do read the rest of my tweets if this one in particular seems wrong.
665567199503888400,Sat Nov 14 16:29:20 +0000 2015,@mycrotchetyluv Yup, that is what I'm saying. How does my tweet (terror isn't independent of religion) imply the endorsement of xenophobia?
665559802005753900,Sat Nov 14 15:59:56 +0000 2015,@nilanjanaroy Funny, but that still doesn't answer the question. @imsabbah
665557120159367200,Sat Nov 14 15:49:17 +0000 2015,@nilanjanaroy Will look 'em up. Aware of Breivik, but a genuine question, minus sarcasm: how is this not whatabout-ery?  @imsabbah
665554807369785300,Sat Nov 14 15:40:06 +0000 2015,@imsabbah It's not something I haven't said before, Sabbah. The next couple of tweets may explain my stand a bit more.
665554400165818400,Sat Nov 14 15:38:29 +0000 2015,How does it help to be blinkered to the point where you ignore the basis on which terror ops are carried out?
665553499443204100,Sat Nov 14 15:34:54 +0000 2015,Faith isn't above criticism. There’s a difference between tarring a community - an obviously daft thing to do - and questioning fairytales.
665532437410091000,Sat Nov 14 14:11:12 +0000 2015,Yup, terror has no religion. If only there was a faith and a book that terrorists swore by, we could connect the two. If only.
665443958567346200,Sat Nov 14 08:19:37 +0000 2015,What a depressing clusterfuck of a species.
665268482875879400,Fri Nov 13 20:42:21 +0000 2015,@surerao I have to ask... what is fuckboys of Tinder?
665243847459340300,Fri Nov 13 19:04:27 +0000 2015,@lovehandle_ So why bring in a false equivalence. Simpler to say "I don't care." Also, why does inconvenience have to be a constant here?
665242835415728100,Fri Nov 13 19:00:26 +0000 2015,@lovehandle_ Forget animals or the environment, it basically comes down to "Guys, can we chill?" vs. "I'm having fun so bugger off".
665242320451711000,Fri Nov 13 18:58:23 +0000 2015,@lovehandle_ Heh. Whatabout-ery aside, it's hardly the same thing in terms of inconvenience. (And tomatina is a chutia festival anyway.)
