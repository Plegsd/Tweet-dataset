849978526782672900,Thu Apr 06 13:34:07 +0000 2017,Rajasthan cess for cows is absurd. Shouldn't below-poverty-line children, hapless widows, orphans, aged merit help before cows
849976452451905500,Thu Apr 06 13:25:52 +0000 2017,I think standing deposit facility is tool to control rising rupee: buy $ to depreciate rupee, absorb excess rupees via standing dep facility
849975319901556700,Thu Apr 06 13:21:22 +0000 2017,RBI leaves a puzzle:Standing deposit facility(where rbi can take money frm banks with no gsecs collateral) will it be mandatory?@ what rate?
849974403983003600,Thu Apr 06 13:17:44 +0000 2017,RBI rightly comes down heavily on farm loan waivers; next step: it must tighten screws on state govts when they come to borrow in the mkt
849973918513287200,Thu Apr 06 13:15:48 +0000 2017,Agree with RBI stance on bad loans. Will allow some tweaks to rules to revamp default loans but no let up on provisioning banks have to make

849823667827724300,Thu Apr 06 03:18:46 +0000 2017,@BalakrishnanR I dont think so.
849823292550545400,Thu Apr 06 03:17:16 +0000 2017,Positive surprise for banks may be any easing of bad loan restructuring rules. Warning; RBI usually suspicious of too easy restructuring
849822298542678000,Thu Apr 06 03:13:19 +0000 2017,RBI's thots and actions on liquidity most impt; low or no probability of CRR hike  but worries persist.
849821793183576000,Thu Apr 06 03:11:19 +0000 2017,RBI could worry about infln; veggie prices are rising; Ultra-low Dec prices can discourage next crop; el nino fears can push up food prices

590148012950687700,Mon Apr 20 13:40:25 +0000 2015,Govt too unlikely to want full convertibility of rupee any time soon; may in fact want depreciating rupee to promote make in India
590147832172052500,Mon Apr 20 13:39:42 +0000 2015,RBI unlikely to be in hurry for more convertibility of rupee considering guv repeatedly raises possibility of disruption when Fed hikes rate
590147223146532900,Mon Apr 20 13:37:17 +0000 2015,I think recent report on convertibility of rupee is misunderstanding by media of RBI guv's extempore reply to a student at Gokhale Institute
