477946208233979900,Sat Jun 14 22:50:30 +0000 2014,It's this ball's last game before retirement. He's 74 this year, which in human years is way into the three-hundreds.
477945679063826400,Sat Jun 14 22:48:24 +0000 2014,The ball is from a long line of World Cup footballs.
477945014262452200,Sat Jun 14 22:45:45 +0000 2014,Looks like the ball may have injured one of its leather pentagons, but no, play on he says. Kick me. What a sportsball.

477944265549824000,Sat Jun 14 22:42:47 +0000 2014,England haven't won a World Cup since 2007 so these goals are like manna from nirvana for them

477943585296617500,Sat Jun 14 22:40:05 +0000 2014,Let's take another look at that goal. This isn't a replay, the players are re-enacting the goal at half speed. Ball is filled with helium.
477943018063151100,Sat Jun 14 22:37:49 +0000 2014,That's a cheeky little goal!
477942793147785200,Sat Jun 14 22:36:56 +0000 2014,And there's another goal.
477942643155271700,Sat Jun 14 22:36:20 +0000 2014,Except when he's happy he can sometimes feel what is known as 'phantom wagging'
477942500674797600,Sat Jun 14 22:35:46 +0000 2014,Football fact: Tonight's referee was born with a vestigial tail. It was removed shortly after birth and he suffered no ill effects.
477942232428081150,Sat Jun 14 22:34:42 +0000 2014,Now that's a great goal from the ref. Showing both teams how it's done.
477942008276066300,Sat Jun 14 22:33:49 +0000 2014,Actually hang on no they are continuing playing
477941808077733900,Sat Jun 14 22:33:01 +0000 2014,And that's it it's all over
