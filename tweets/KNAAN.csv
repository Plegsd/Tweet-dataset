2336414482,Fri Jun 26 00:56:33 +0000 2009,@EchoRose well i have fans from all walks of life apparently.. one of them recently called me "just another angry african" anyway..
2336355109,Fri Jun 26 00:52:28 +0000 2009,@EchoRose the point is not how pure ur heart is, & how much we all love children, it's about the social media war against some & not others
2336334435,Fri Jun 26 00:51:05 +0000 2009,@EchoRose no, i don't know.. because Mike was accused of these things, while we know the others to be facts, yet he was dehumanized for it
2336273731,Fri Jun 26 00:46:58 +0000 2009,@EchoRose or why didn't they bring Elvis down for being with a 14 year old? Selective morality as a shield for racism is REAL. That's all
2336243783,Fri Jun 26 00:44:58 +0000 2009,@EchoRose really? if that's all it takes, why didn't they bring Woody Allen down when he married his step daughter?
2336067443,Fri Jun 26 00:33:20 +0000 2009,The tragedy is that they think they won. But we know, the burden is carried by the ungrateful who tried to bring down the greats.
2336052255,Fri Jun 26 00:32:21 +0000 2009,I think with the concerts he planned, he sought to avenge his star's light in the face of media giants who made him their sacrificial lamb
2336026893,Fri Jun 26 00:30:46 +0000 2009,What bothers me the most about Mike's passing is the timing of it all. It's as if ur misunderstood unlikely hero died before the final fight
2335194802,Thu Jun 25 23:44:26 +0000 2009,I know we all go, I know I'm suppose to be positive, but at this point it's just physical: I'm feeling dazed and immersed by sadness.
2334266038,Thu Jun 25 22:55:50 +0000 2009,I shared the world's love for Michael Jackson, but I had no idea it would affect me this way.

2241706651,Fri Jun 19 18:16:43 +0000 2009,and so we would kill ourselves out of desperation for change. Hence, In a perfect world, there would be a lot more suicides.
2241690693,Fri Jun 19 18:15:34 +0000 2009,and without it, this human need for change and adequacy, we would be devoid of reason to continue to exist, no where 2 go after perfection
2241672780,Fri Jun 19 18:14:14 +0000 2009,the passion to grow, to attain, to struggle for, to live up to, we multiple for it, we divide for it, we war for it and peace for it,
2241655982,Fri Jun 19 18:12:59 +0000 2009,"if the world was perfect" then think of "there would be a lot more suicides" .. because the human is fueled by the passion to fix,
2241620343,Fri Jun 19 18:10:21 +0000 2009,"there would be a lot more suicides" would be harsh. In my ideal world there would not be any suicides. But consider the phrase to mean:
2241610129,Fri Jun 19 18:09:37 +0000 2009,A lot of you ONLY thought of the phrase "in a perfect world" to mean "in an ideal world" in which case, my saying:
2241588220,Fri Jun 19 18:07:58 +0000 2009,2 ways to consider the idea "in a perfect world". 1 way to think of it is, "in an ideal world" another way is "if the world were perfect"
2241548106,Fri Jun 19 18:05:06 +0000 2009,So last night I said, regarding the trending topic #inaperfectworld, that inaperfectworld there would be a lot more suicides. Explanation:

1505551315,Sun Apr 12 22:51:00 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh buying my cd helps you, more than it does me. But thanks anyway.
1505492262,Sun Apr 12 22:39:26 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh read on it, there is not one account of violence on a captive, at sea or land. I hope this has been helpful to you. Goodnight.
1505469505,Sun Apr 12 22:34:51 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh not true. No captive which has been taken to land has been harmed.
1505460759,Sun Apr 12 22:33:05 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh a lot of major governments asked the US NOT to use violence in fear of the repercussions, but that was clearly ignored

1505443605,Sun Apr 12 22:29:41 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh actually it would have been better for all involved if they let the pirates reach land..because they would have negotiated

1505404311,Sun Apr 12 22:21:51 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh countries could be provoked, so the ripple affect could be even more disastrous. I think America acted not as a citizen of a

1505381912,Sun Apr 12 22:17:27 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh (keeping in mind they've been non violent thus far) so killing them could cause repercussions. They have over 200 other foreign
1505374815,Sun Apr 12 22:16:05 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh I think the navy's actions are ONLY concerned with America's welfare. Problem with that is, killing these pirates,
1505354069,Sun Apr 12 22:12:01 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh would you rather know about my own feelings on ur navy's actions, or would u rather learn about the truth of the issue @ hand?
1505336730,Sun Apr 12 22:08:39 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh I don't understand why you are so much more interested in talking about something u don't know, rather than learning about it.
1505319329,Sun Apr 12 22:05:13 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh you can't look at the big picture, you don't know the language of the PAINTING! goodness. That's it. I'm done. READ SOMETHING!

1505283395,Sun Apr 12 21:58:17 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh well then you're like a blind person arguing about the difference between primary and secondary colors.

1505266850,Sun Apr 12 21:55:01 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh have you read anything on the subject? I don't think you realize just how twisted and complicated the whole thing is really.
1505246967,Sun Apr 12 21:51:10 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh did you say you "know" what the pirates wanted? how so? who told you?
1505243521,Sun Apr 12 21:50:29 +0000 2009,@Timksl nope.  it's not clear.  Read on the subject.

1505147193,Sun Apr 12 21:31:16 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh U wrote "Im happy that they were killed" how else could u mean that? & should my supposed hostility 2 the navy change ur soul?
1505118853,Sun Apr 12 21:25:43 +0000 2009,@kuhtahrrruh You are happy that human lives are lost? You are clearly someone who doesn't know the value of life.

1492021366,Fri Apr 10 18:11:32 +0000 2009,@goofustroop somali politics is more complicated than could be explained in a couple of articles.. but it's all internal, and complicated
1492015374,Fri Apr 10 18:10:35 +0000 2009,@goofustroop the pirates are not in connection with anything to do with business in dubai or london, you are misinformed.
1491951341,Fri Apr 10 18:00:40 +0000 2009,@goofustroop The dumping is from the West, Im not here in support of piracy, but their faults don't delete the faults of others.No excuses.
1491769998,Fri Apr 10 17:33:06 +0000 2009,@goofustroop did you read ANY of the articles I put up? http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2008/10/2008109174223218644.html to aid you
1491748004,Fri Apr 10 17:29:55 +0000 2009,Monday night I'm going on the internationally renowned journalist  Riz Khan's show, on Al Jazeera English. I imagine subject will be this.
1491728119,Fri Apr 10 17:26:56 +0000 2009,@emailelle if that was the case, the world would be less tragic..truth is, All must fall in the hole to know its depth.
1491720143,Fri Apr 10 17:25:44 +0000 2009,@negrita they're actually not.. they're a stand alone force.. but you'd have to be a somali to know those sorts of deep inner politics.
1491712537,Fri Apr 10 17:24:36 +0000 2009,@Kataalyst Please read before you ask a question.
1491685633,Fri Apr 10 17:20:30 +0000 2009,UN Envoy confirms Toxic Waste Dumping. http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2008/10/2008109174223218644.html More info. Pls Read.
1491646919,Fri Apr 10 17:14:37 +0000 2009,@negrita I remember this one. It's in my collection because of the UN envoy's quote. Thank you. I'll share with everyone.
1491587977,Fri Apr 10 17:05:35 +0000 2009,@retorta thanks.. wish i knew that earlier.
1491568289,Fri Apr 10 17:02:37 +0000 2009,@newtgingrich Did you know that George Washington and your founding fathers commissioned Pirates against the British? Somalia is like old US
1491546455,Fri Apr 10 16:59:24 +0000 2009,@ToureX that's because fish stick eaters are generally afraid of pirates. haha
1491533913,Fri Apr 10 16:57:28 +0000 2009,@ToureX was good talking to you yesterday.. your interview questions were great.
1491519957,Fri Apr 10 16:55:22 +0000 2009,Thank you all who have re tweeting. And for the all impassioned responses. I appreciate ya'll. I get restless about injustices.

1491414247,Fri Apr 10 16:39:19 +0000 2009,@prometheusbrown Absolutely. Ppl have the tendency to imagine Africa as if it inherently so, all the while conditions are imposed, now&then
1491389179,Fri Apr 10 16:35:25 +0000 2009,@douglaspaul you're right. I've been developing a film on the subject for the past 2 years.
1491383938,Fri Apr 10 16:34:38 +0000 2009,Hostage Taking isn't right.  Robbing people isn't right.  But one robbery is no more sacred than another.
1491381280,Fri Apr 10 16:34:15 +0000 2009,@teresajohns No, hostage taking isn't right. Robbing people isn't right. But one robbery is no more sacred than another.
1491367943,Fri Apr 10 16:32:11 +0000 2009,@PhlaymzGudMoney Sure, but i have a feeling you wouldn't say that if you lived in a village surviving on that fish and cant find it 1 day.
1491344871,Fri Apr 10 16:28:45 +0000 2009,@prometheusbrown here it's not just about conditions, its about a great injustice It's about someone mixing a poison and planting it under U
1491319477,Fri Apr 10 16:24:56 +0000 2009,@Toronto_Chef it's not BS when an entire coastal village can no longer feed itself because all their fish is gone! &yes there is more 2 IT 2
1491301642,Fri Apr 10 16:22:08 +0000 2009,Solution? Bring the corporate European Mafia that DESTROYED our marine life beyond repair to justice. Only after justice will there be PEACE
1491294947,Fri Apr 10 16:21:05 +0000 2009,@sohood Bring the corporate European Mafia that destroyed our marine life beyond repair to justice. Only after justice will there be peace.
1491277259,Fri Apr 10 16:18:23 +0000 2009,@PhlaymzGudMoney if we apply that philosophy unto land, it means i could just to go to your family farm and pack my truck with what is there
1491259612,Fri Apr 10 16:15:41 +0000 2009,@PhlaymzGudMoney well there is such thing as territorial integrity.. the issue at hand is the illegal entry into a sovereign state to steal

1491227979,Fri Apr 10 16:10:51 +0000 2009,Seriously ya'll.  Read that article and send me your responses.  This is what EVERY Somali I know knows about, but no one cares to hears us!

1491165566,Fri Apr 10 16:01:15 +0000 2009,@sohood the UN might as well dress up in a pink version of the American army's uniform.
1491149380,Fri Apr 10 15:58:51 +0000 2009,@PhlaymzGudMoney You steal sea life by stealing  tuna, lobster, shrimp.
1491098665,Fri Apr 10 15:51:05 +0000 2009,@sohood There isn't. Since Somalia has not had a functioning central government for 18 years now. No one can affectively patrol the waters.
1491064348,Fri Apr 10 15:45:50 +0000 2009,I'm sorry about the captain, wish him a safe return and his family patience.  NOW WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE REAL QUESTIONS PEOPLE?
1491057183,Fri Apr 10 15:44:45 +0000 2009,Nuclear and other toxic waste materials have by now almost entirely destroyed Somalia's once majestic marine life.
1491046865,Fri Apr 10 15:43:11 +0000 2009,More than 300 million dollars a year of sea life is stolen from Somali waters by vessels from Western Countries..
1491044391,Fri Apr 10 15:42:49 +0000 2009,@angelayee I'm glad. Mass media is still trying very desperately to ignore the facts.
1490983821,Fri Apr 10 15:33:23 +0000 2009,Captain tried to escape & is recaptured by the Pirates again. US destroyer lurks nearby. Pirates have summoned backup. Situation is tense.

1456065970,Sun Apr 05 07:54:00 +0000 2009,Some people have context issues with lyrics.. someone thought my saying "you gotta be like Bush and take preemptive strikes" was pro Bush.
1456063463,Sun Apr 05 07:52:54 +0000 2009,@Clifsoulo if you think the line "fight with guns or utensils" is me endorsing guns than you really have no understanding of my music.

1455107138,Sun Apr 05 03:09:09 +0000 2009,@SaulWilliams i'm frightened of it as it is, i'm hoping that our friendship alone places me out of the likelihood of it happening to me..
1455102014,Sun Apr 05 03:08:03 +0000 2009,@SaulWilliams HAHA!!! i'm glad you can have humor about this.  good god, a friend had the lightening experience on a plane..

1450193316,Sat Apr 04 05:29:01 +0000 2009,Baltimore show was DOPE!! I didn't know we had THAT much love in Bmore. Thank ya'll.
1449179785,Sat Apr 04 01:35:48 +0000 2009,@RealPeace you have 8 twitters you can send that are 140 limits. tag it #knaansong
1448702730,Fri Apr 03 23:55:54 +0000 2009,Otherwise, this would have been freeform poetry, or an essay, or a book.  Instead, this is a song. A lot of good stuff been coming, keep on!
1448696915,Fri Apr 03 23:54:47 +0000 2009,Also, there is a discipline to songwriting which we should be exercising here, clear sentiments and stories in a short space and time.
1448683890,Fri Apr 03 23:52:09 +0000 2009,The lyrics are being complied from twitter, so there's no where else to send it.
1448679235,Fri Apr 03 23:51:14 +0000 2009,For those who keep asking me if there is another way to send lyrics in because they wanna make it longer.. here's your answer...
1435566880,Thu Apr 02 01:37:24 +0000 2009,@TheCoolestLoser no you don't haha..  i just meant for future reference.
1435564531,Thu Apr 02 01:36:59 +0000 2009,@MimiMohamed but i'll be in london from the 6th to the 9th, and we play a show on the 9th.
1435557074,Thu Apr 02 01:35:37 +0000 2009,@MimiMohamed I don't deal with press commitments personally. Hope that's understandable. This site is for me to communicate with my fans.
1435523493,Thu Apr 02 01:29:34 +0000 2009,Send all lyrics tagged "#knaansong" so I can differentiate comments from lyrics. Well hopefully that much would be clear anyway lol
1435510969,Thu Apr 02 01:27:19 +0000 2009,@Gypsy77 no, the challenge is, for the writing concept to be clear enough to fit into 8 tweet boxes.  Try that.
1435456099,Thu Apr 02 01:17:21 +0000 2009,@tiyyah check the guidelines. Basically you are allowed up to 8 box full of twitters.
1435453878,Thu Apr 02 01:16:55 +0000 2009,@JaZZiii yea you're cool, you have time.. the contest will be going for a while. I'll look into deadline.
1435397762,Thu Apr 02 01:06:34 +0000 2009,@IskuFilan Thanks iskufilan. Qofna uma baahnid miyaa? :)
1435386571,Thu Apr 02 01:04:29 +0000 2009,Here's the link to the original song, and also the instrumental for you to write to: http://www.amoctone.com/knaan/plmtweet/
1435376139,Thu Apr 02 01:02:40 +0000 2009,@TheCoolestLoser This is not an april fools joke. This is foreal. I promise.
1435362414,Thu Apr 02 01:00:14 +0000 2009,I hope this explains, I can't wait to see what ya'll will write. Already Juberland has upped the bar. Be inspired! It's for People Like Me.
1435355833,Thu Apr 02 00:59:06 +0000 2009,Eventually, I will pick the winning verse, and record it myself for all to hear, crediting the tweeter as a co writer of the song.
1435347798,Thu Apr 02 00:57:35 +0000 2009,This song is about relating to each others humanity and struggles. And creating a unified message even if we do lead very different lives.
1435343535,Thu Apr 02 00:56:46 +0000 2009,I wanted to see what one of you tweeters would say if you had the opportunity to remark on your views on universal struggle.
1435336561,Thu Apr 02 00:55:29 +0000 2009,In the original, I take on the lives of 2 different individuals, one is an American soldier in Iraq, the other a woman who's losing her home
1435332887,Thu Apr 02 00:54:46 +0000 2009,Listen to the song first, think about the tempo of it, and write to that, but it's also important to make it thematically relevant.
1435326987,Thu Apr 02 00:53:38 +0000 2009,Ok, this remaking of People Like Me, with lyrics written on your tweet box, is basically an opportunity for creative minds to feel inspired
1435316283,Thu Apr 02 00:51:34 +0000 2009,@Juberland got that...we'll have to wait for all the entrees.. but it's dope.
1435310502,Thu Apr 02 00:50:26 +0000 2009,@LiamCorcoran it's not help that i need to write a song... it's an opportunity for other creative people to feel inspired to write.
1431168778,Wed Apr 01 13:08:25 +0000 2009,Ok, time to sleep for a bit.
1430649185,Wed Apr 01 10:58:26 +0000 2009,@negrita no, not streaming.. :)

1428935668,Wed Apr 01 02:59:23 +0000 2009,"I hunger for the pale stones of your fingernails, I want to eat your skin like a whole almond."
1428019322,Wed Apr 01 00:15:59 +0000 2009,@BigSamir we'll be in studio around 7... hit up ray.
1427922369,Tue Mar 31 23:58:26 +0000 2009,@PlugWonDeLaSoul they should have a corner for dads waiting for kids at the barber shop, where you can be productive and play Halo
