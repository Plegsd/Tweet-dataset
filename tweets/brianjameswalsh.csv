659828684803539000,Thu Oct 29 20:26:32 +0000 2015,Worth noting that for a second election (remember Reid's phony attacks on Romney's taxes) Reid is using the Senate floor for pure politics.
659828425729835000,Thu Oct 29 20:25:30 +0000 2015,Reid's efforts to spin why he believes Rubio should resign even though Obama missed more votes is just incredibly weak. Guy is so shameless.

644342277544894500,Thu Sep 17 02:49:04 +0000 2015,Wait did Trump seriously just say that just last week one of his employees got their child vaccinated and now he's autistic? In a week?

644336670112809000,Thu Sep 17 02:26:48 +0000 2015,In 2005, @tedcruz called John Roberts "brilliant" and said "the Senate should confirm him swiftly." http://t.co/vaY0D0FnxY
644334787377827800,Thu Sep 17 02:19:19 +0000 2015,Here's the @NRO op-ed where Cruz loudly endorsed John Roberts' nomination. He's just not telling the truth. http://t.co/vaY0D0FnxY
644330494910304300,Thu Sep 17 02:02:15 +0000 2015,Trump looking smaller and smaller as this debate goes on.
644328310994939900,Thu Sep 17 01:53:35 +0000 2015,Why wasn't Hewitt given the opportunity to ask Trump that question about his interview? Odd.
644325129120448500,Thu Sep 17 01:40:56 +0000 2015,Nothing against Jake Tapper but I'd love to hear more questions from @hughhewitt.
644322664748728300,Thu Sep 17 01:31:08 +0000 2015,Fiorina showing the path to take on Trump. Hit him where he's weakest - with facts.
644320734299291600,Thu Sep 17 01:23:28 +0000 2015,As you listen to Cruz rant about "amnesty" note that he's never once explained how he would address the 12M undocumented. Not once.
644317861121384400,Thu Sep 17 01:12:03 +0000 2015,Not surprisingly, Trump totally incapable of explaining how specifically he would round-up, process and deport 12M people.
644316668785594400,Thu Sep 17 01:07:19 +0000 2015,Boom! Carly with the haymaker.
644315469202112500,Thu Sep 17 01:02:33 +0000 2015,Arguably having 11 candidates on the stage helps Trump because it allows him to hide his total lack of foreign &amp; domestic policy knowledge.
644312464360734700,Thu Sep 17 00:50:36 +0000 2015,As Cruz is talking right now Trump's thinking "what the hell is al nusra"?
644309267260969000,Thu Sep 17 00:37:54 +0000 2015,Trump versus Rubio on foreign policy was literally night and day in those last two minutes.
644308955884228600,Thu Sep 17 00:36:40 +0000 2015,Trump: "I would get along with Putin."  Will be interested to see how that plays with the base.
644308207800729600,Thu Sep 17 00:33:42 +0000 2015,It seems literally every week some new person has offered Trump $5M and he's turned it down. Every week he's used that line.
644305754766331900,Thu Sep 17 00:23:57 +0000 2015,Trump seems totally uninterested in speaking to voters and only interested in settling scores with other candidates.
644305312200036400,Thu Sep 17 00:22:11 +0000 2015,Bizarre attack on Rand Paul shows a very thin-skin by Trump early on. And a great comeback by Senator Paul.
644303839500210200,Thu Sep 17 00:16:20 +0000 2015,Trump forgot to mention free unicorns for everyone in his opening remarks. Then again, he said he wasn't trying to brag.

643591279071363100,Tue Sep 15 01:04:52 +0000 2015,@pkcapitol Wasn't my point - on election night everyone knew O'Donnell would lose but it was ratings. No national TV coverage for Ayotte.
643588344568512500,Tue Sep 15 00:53:13 +0000 2015,Trump coverage reminds me when natl TV crews were in DE on 2010 Election Night covering Christine O'Donnell but all ignored Kelly Ayotte.

543460332724052000,Fri Dec 12 17:40:14 +0000 2014,Still waiting to see the headlines about Elizabeth Warren's efforts to shutdown the federal government.
543143349969236000,Thu Dec 11 20:40:40 +0000 2014,Remember when Elizabeth Warren slammed a "small minority" for shutting down the government last year? https://t.co/qLPCfcFk3x

497047755249188860,Wed Aug 06 15:53:14 +0000 2014,@jmgehrke Best spin is the fact-based kind. Matt Hoskins has made twice as much from @SCF this cycle than they've spent against all Dems.
497046945228415000,Wed Aug 06 15:50:01 +0000 2014,@jmgehrke We're all familiar with the spin.  Reality is they've spent more installing a wine cellar in @SFC HQ than against Dems this cycle.

497044155701686300,Wed Aug 06 15:38:56 +0000 2014,@Joelmentum Great question. Someone should ask them. @SCF has spent more renovating their townhouse than against Democrats this cycle.
497043796077850600,Wed Aug 06 15:37:30 +0000 2014,@Joelmentum SCF has spent nothing against Braley for example even though they endorsed Ernst because that doesn't raise money for them.
497043527654989800,Wed Aug 06 15:36:26 +0000 2014,@Joelmentum SCF spent $15M in GOP primaries. Yet they've spent less than $300K against Democrats. The numbers speak for themselves.
