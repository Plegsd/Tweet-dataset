523524365397155840,Sat Oct 18 17:21:49 +0000 2014,@FoxNewsFan @apiper848 you're like Rumsfeld et al who thought because air power worked against Serbs and Saddam 1990 it'd work in 2003 WRONG
523524083397320700,Sat Oct 18 17:20:42 +0000 2014,@FoxNewsFan @apiper848 but how is Kosovo a similar military situation to Iraq? Truly. Give me one aspect.
523523764634394600,Sat Oct 18 17:19:26 +0000 2014,@FoxNewsFan totally wrong comparison. You're saying K war worked despite the criticism. Ok. Air war 2003-2008 failed. And much more similar
523498572105281540,Sat Oct 18 15:39:20 +0000 2014,@FoxNewsFan @apiper848 true - I didn't see that 4 other towns would fall first. Tactical situation can change but not strategic factors
523498065425334300,Sat Oct 18 15:37:19 +0000 2014,@FoxNewsFan I'm baffled how you think Kosovo is better comparison than Iraq war II. Kosovo was 1/100th the size with a conventional enemy

523118221767876600,Fri Oct 17 14:27:57 +0000 2014,@FoxNewsFan really? The Kosovo air campaign caused the Serbs to collapse. This one slowed Isis's advance on one town. Not a great comparison
