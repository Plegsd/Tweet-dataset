663769758400024600,Mon Nov 09 17:26:57 +0000 2015,@ericward I just revised that section of the article. Take a look and let me know your thoughts. Better wording, more clear now?
663768992301998100,Mon Nov 09 17:23:54 +0000 2015,@ericward I'm not saying blogging or guest blogging is or will ever become obsolete; quite the opposite! I'm a huge advocate for both.
663768394915643400,Mon Nov 09 17:21:32 +0000 2015,@ericward I think "bulk link building" might resonate more clearly and be more accurate. How about you?
