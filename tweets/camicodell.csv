8945801422,Thu Feb 11 04:08:36 +0000 2010,@brycerobertson same...sort of...what you wanna do feels so innocent compared to what i want to do...more like large, metal, SHARP objects.
8945651974,Thu Feb 11 04:04:43 +0000 2010,@SamSchiffman same!! after about five seconds of contemplation...just the whole thing was so embarrassing...
8945434219,Thu Feb 11 03:59:18 +0000 2010,@brycerobertson see, I don't scream. or even acknowledge them. I just walk behind them and mutter very, very bad, horrible, violent things.
8944985039,Thu Feb 11 03:47:40 +0000 2010,My #petpeeve 's are when people walk slowly in the hallways, and when people say "should of". It's should HAVE.
8944793591,Thu Feb 11 03:42:43 +0000 2010,The musical is clearly etched forever in my brain if it's all I tweet about. I need a distraction...someone please ask me a random question.
8944601852,Thu Feb 11 03:37:46 +0000 2010,Today I was faced with a tough decision: Do I pick up the hat I just dropped in the middle of the finale or do I keep dancing? I love ACL...

8943960921,Thu Feb 11 03:21:36 +0000 2010,@landonliboiron_ Well, you said to ask...will you please follow me? Maybe my incoherent babbling will even amuse you. :)
8943798273,Thu Feb 11 03:17:36 +0000 2010,These emails are flattering/intriguing/a little creepy...and I'm only a sophomore. Please, college...not now.
8943514006,Thu Feb 11 03:10:41 +0000 2010,"Camille, we're impressed with your achievements!" "Camille, we've noticed you!" "Camille, top scholar..." COLLEGES, I AM NOT THAT SPECIAL!!

8940786140,Thu Feb 11 02:06:11 +0000 2010,Home from rehearsal...so exhausted! I dropped my hat in the middle of the finale...like, while I was holding it. True life: I'm a klutz.
