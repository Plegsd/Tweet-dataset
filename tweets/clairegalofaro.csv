540544248450646000,Thu Dec 04 16:32:46 +0000 2014,"It was a mistake," she says, and assures jury neither police nor prosecutors bullied or coerced witnesses

540538259722739700,Thu Dec 04 16:08:58 +0000 2014,"It's not an easy job to give up your boyfriend on a murder case," Brown says, describing why Stalvey had to lean on Princess.
540535504253780000,Thu Dec 04 15:58:01 +0000 2014,Princess Bolin, who recanted at trial, told police years ago she overheard Hammond assuring his jailed brother he'd take care of the witness
540533893888479200,Thu Dec 04 15:51:37 +0000 2014,Sheckles boyfriend Don'Teze Hurt didn't know the gunman at the time, but testified he recognized Steven Pettway as the killer at his trial
540533147180748800,Thu Dec 04 15:48:39 +0000 2014,"This was an execution," Brown says, not a robbery or a fight gone too far. The shooter wanted Sheckles dead and Hammond has motive.
540532958982340600,Thu Dec 04 15:47:54 +0000 2014,Sheckles yelled "oh baby watch out" to her boyfriend as the shooter jumped over picnic table. She tried to run as he emptied his gun

540522895597129700,Thu Dec 04 15:07:55 +0000 2014,"Would yo make an important decision in your life based on (the state's case)?" Shouse asks. "We do not guess people into the penitentiary."
540519700346994700,Thu Dec 04 14:55:13 +0000 2014,"This was an extraordinarily unprofessional investigation," Shouse says, cites Stalvey's failure to follow up on other leads
540519400135467000,Thu Dec 04 14:54:02 +0000 2014,Shouse reminds jury about Det. Roy Stalvey's demeanor: he made jokes about fat women texting him while Princess cried during their interview

540518121728405500,Thu Dec 04 14:48:57 +0000 2014,Shouse noted how unusual it was that a former prosecutor was called by the state. The point, Shouse said, was to say: "I am not a crook."
540517721134604300,Thu Dec 04 14:47:21 +0000 2014,Shouse: prosecutors had to impeach all of their own witnesses, because each recanted. "I've never heard of such a thing."
540515522371391500,Thu Dec 04 14:38:37 +0000 2014,"Their strategy with Princess was one of a carrot and a stick. Don't give us what we want? Whack. And they did that for years."
540514912662192100,Thu Dec 04 14:36:12 +0000 2014,Shouse says Princess was "ill-used" by the system, squeezed with threats of prison and criminal charges if she didn't help them

540513024927596540,Thu Dec 04 14:28:42 +0000 2014,"This case is about tunnel vision," he says, arguing cops decided Hammond was guilty the day of the murder and bullied witnesses to prove it
540512715752890400,Thu Dec 04 14:27:28 +0000 2014,Shouse mocks state's story, says Dejuan Hammond would have had to organize a "seal team mission" to accomplice the murder they describe.
540512246045372400,Thu Dec 04 14:25:36 +0000 2014,Shouse reminds jury that no physical evidence ties Hammond to Troya Sheckles murder.
