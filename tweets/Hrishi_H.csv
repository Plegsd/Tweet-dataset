926872975734984700,Sat Nov 04 18:05:12 +0000 2017,@AmericanAir Where can I write to request some kind of compensation for this issue created entirely by AA?
926872805995634700,Sat Nov 04 18:04:32 +0000 2017,@AmericanAir I understand that.  But this is just bad operations.  We are now waiting on 3rd plane.  Either your pl… https://t.co/KHHhxJwYHq

926857536074117100,Sat Nov 04 17:03:51 +0000 2017,@AmericanAir Terrible operations.  AA 3749. Two gate changes, flight delayed pushing back by 1 hour. Now back at gate for maintenance issue!
898300797074653200,Thu Aug 17 21:49:34 +0000 2017,@ridetheferry Terrible app.  App signs me out automatically just as I am about to board, doesn't let me show activated ticket. Missed ferry
874695769906962400,Tue Jun 13 18:31:37 +0000 2017,@PublicStorage I am a current customer and this is very poor service.  Time to look to another storage company.
874695659127025700,Tue Jun 13 18:31:10 +0000 2017,@PublicStorage Hoboken, NJ facility hours says 9-6 on website and facility. But staff sitting inside apparently on lunch break and not open!
796888004912709600,Fri Nov 11 01:31:20 +0000 2016,@AmericanAir More than an hour late on AA132 and more than 3 hours late on AA2321. Sheesh.  Upgrade your aircraft.
796872379825786900,Fri Nov 11 00:29:15 +0000 2016,@AmericanAir Third time today that I have had to deal with maintenance issues.  Twice with AA2321 this morning and now AA132.

776313167127261200,Thu Sep 15 06:54:16 +0000 2016,@RitzCarlton Worst experience at the Ritz Carlton Dallas - was bumped even though I had a reservation. And no one called to inform me.
758925065551384600,Fri Jul 29 07:20:10 +0000 2016,#United Landed at 8:40am at MXP on UA19.  It is 9:20 now and still waiting for bags! Terrible service.

58039179115888640,Wed Apr 13 05:29:53 +0000 2011,@Somlucci I suppose WVU would make Marc Bulger a small-town guy and not a small-school guy.  Get it right Brady!
53972193805205500,Sat Apr 02 00:09:08 +0000 2011,Feels like 2003 all over again - except that I am hoping that the result will be different this time!
53142994852921340,Wed Mar 30 17:14:11 +0000 2011,Phew!  Never thought the guys could pull it off....  I know - ye of little faith.....
53099081299542020,Wed Mar 30 14:19:42 +0000 2011,Biggest blunder of this game - picking both Patel and Nehra!
53065417975021570,Wed Mar 30 12:05:56 +0000 2011,All I want for Christmas is India batting 50 overs.  I know - thats a lot to ask and Christmas is a long way off.
53063427236691970,Wed Mar 30 11:58:01 +0000 2011,@Somlucci - that's right, didnt think about that.
53062816818663420,Wed Mar 30 11:55:36 +0000 2011,Need MSD and SKR to step up in these last 10 overs.  C'mon India.
53060076134612990,Wed Mar 30 11:44:42 +0000 2011,Maybe this is for the good?!  When Sachin scores a century, India invariably loses....  Or is this false hope?

29371938950352896,Mon Jan 24 02:56:30 +0000 2011,@nrc127 I love the #Jets.  You know you can count on them to revert back to form and choke.
29370771725885440,Mon Jan 24 02:51:52 +0000 2011,@Ian_OConnor It takes a lot more than wishing for a safety for the Jets to get to a superbowl.  Enjoy off-season!

6311727699,Thu Dec 03 18:57:34 +0000 2009,@sportsguy33 As a matter of principle (for a New England fan), you cant pick the Jets - not after all that Rex Ryan trash talk.
