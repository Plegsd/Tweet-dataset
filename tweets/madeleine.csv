725444933813960700,Wed Apr 27 22:02:04 +0000 2016,The so-called #TrumpDoctrine is simply bellicose rhetoric strung together with contradictory statements. Bluster is no strategy, Mr. Trump.
725444468925698000,Wed Apr 27 22:00:14 +0000 2016,Trump’s proposals to ban Muslims and deport immigrants would undermine America’s greatest strengths: diversity and tolerance.
725443869383483400,Wed Apr 27 21:57:51 +0000 2016,Trump's newest slogan is "America First," recalling the self-defeating isolationism of the 1930s.
725442650720092200,Wed Apr 27 21:53:00 +0000 2016,Trump’s views on torture are completely out of sync with recommendations by military leaders and America’s values.
725442243063062500,Wed Apr 27 21:51:23 +0000 2016,Trump praises Western values, then questions why we should support democracy in other countries.
725441994240172000,Wed Apr 27 21:50:24 +0000 2016,Trump’s understanding of trade policy is simplistic at best, and would have disastrous effects on our economy.
725441828716208100,Wed Apr 27 21:49:44 +0000 2016,Trump preaches unpredictability as a policy, then asks us to trust him with the nuclear codes.
725441588269334500,Wed Apr 27 21:48:47 +0000 2016,Trump speaks about regaining the trust of our allies, but then threatens to pull out of NATO.
725441272245313500,Wed Apr 27 21:47:32 +0000 2016,Trump demonstrates no real understanding of complex international issues and has no serious proposals for how to address them.
725441002358624300,Wed Apr 27 21:46:27 +0000 2016,So I thought I'd respond using his favorite method of communication and tackle some of the #TrumpDoctrine's biggest flaws head on.
