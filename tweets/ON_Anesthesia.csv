756879845095649300,Sat Jul 23 15:53:11 +0000 2016,.@PamelaVelos @shawn_whatley @DocSchmadia not sure we understand, we referenced a peer reviewed publication on waste in our practice
756879428211224600,Sat Jul 23 15:51:32 +0000 2016,.@DocSchmadia @shawn_whatley @hepatoMD Please let us know what details you want on that - our exec is meeting with OMA prez and neg chair
756877041325207600,Sat Jul 23 15:42:03 +0000 2016,.@DocSchmadia @shawn_whatley @hepatoMD That's fair. However, the binding dispute resolution at PSC should offer protection.
756871783819739100,Sat Jul 23 15:21:09 +0000 2016,.@shawn_whatley @DocSchmadia @DrKyleKirkham Agreed, the publication in CMAJ is on Perioperative care.  Hopefully, all Sections do the same
756871062835585000,Sat Jul 23 15:18:18 +0000 2016,.@shawn_whatley @DocSchmadia Thanks Shawn!
756870860401705000,Sat Jul 23 15:17:29 +0000 2016,.@KoalaKingston @DocSchmadia @shawn_whatley this is a valid concern. Trust is earned and takes time.
756870300755689500,Sat Jul 23 15:15:16 +0000 2016,.@hepatoMD @shawn_whatley @DocSchmadia Agreed. We understand there's neutral binding dispute resolution at PSC for check/balance
756869505373077500,Sat Jul 23 15:12:06 +0000 2016,.@DocSchmadia @shawn_whatley checkout @DrKyleKirkham paper in CMAJ a few months back for evidence from our specialty
756867517025554400,Sat Jul 23 15:04:12 +0000 2016,.@hepatoMD @shawn_whatley @DocSchmadia Agreed, let's have that discussion
756867085322620900,Sat Jul 23 15:02:29 +0000 2016,.@shawn_whatley @DocSchmadia Agreed. We are opposed to rationing needed care but highly in favour of eliminating waste.
756866476787785700,Sat Jul 23 15:00:04 +0000 2016,.@DocSchmadia @shawn_whatley agreed, it will be hard to do, but we must try and co-management should make our task easier
756864132423581700,Sat Jul 23 14:50:45 +0000 2016,.@DocSchmadia @shawn_whatley or maybe we should stop paying doctors for unnecessary care and re-invest those resources in much needed care

756839196380303400,Sat Jul 23 13:11:40 +0000 2016,.@astroboydoc maybe, how do suggest we address now?
756834729375195100,Sat Jul 23 12:53:55 +0000 2016,.@astroboydoc we agree and best available evidence suggests we won't have to if we eliminate the unnecessary things in our control
756830497364447200,Sat Jul 23 12:37:06 +0000 2016,.@astroboydoc we'd rather measure and get credit for those savings and reinvest in the SOB in a co-management process - that's a win-win
756824988963921900,Sat Jul 23 12:15:13 +0000 2016,.@astroboydoc because without a deal we can't do those required things and there is no such thing as a perfect deal - every deal has flaws

756597566645604400,Fri Jul 22 21:11:31 +0000 2016,.@astroboydoc adoption of perioperative CWC dont's is our official policy - co-management allows us to implement and improve quality

756593597168902100,Fri Jul 22 20:55:45 +0000 2016,.@astroboydoc we firmly believe in our right to binding arbitration, and look forward to the OMA's day in court - but we must still lead now
