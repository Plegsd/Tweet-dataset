8244642768,Tue Jan 26 18:09:06 +0000 2010,If Spirit can get into a better power position for winter, she'll "hibernate" but remain very alive.
8244583480,Tue Jan 26 18:07:19 +0000 2010,Spirit will remain in her current location. Goal now is to prepare for coming winter (south hemi) by tilting solar panels northward.
8092439386,Sat Jan 23 01:13:47 +0000 2010,@KnaJoh Cool! We haven't seen solar panels and wheels that clean in a long time.
8047410972,Fri Jan 22 00:03:32 +0000 2010,According to lead scientist Steve Squyres, the mystery rock "is one of the coolest things Oppy has found in a very long time."

7420710087,Wed Jan 06 00:07:38 +0000 2010,@kam75 Unfortunately, Spirit's arm isn't strong enough to push (plus it could damage science instruments at the end of the arm).
7420534123,Wed Jan 06 00:01:49 +0000 2010,@tekoneiric There isn't a way to distribute the weight, we can't actively lift any of the wheels or move them out of the way.
7393094582,Tue Jan 05 04:52:03 +0000 2010,@theonetruebix Thanks, we loved your post commemorating the 6th anniversary of landing!
7387421300,Tue Jan 05 01:50:11 +0000 2010,@AITRGam Unfortunately, no, it wouldn't work.  But thanks for thinking of us!
7245635992,Thu Dec 31 19:55:20 +0000 2009,@LJespersen 6 Earth years, 3.2 Mars years. Pretty amazing considering we didn't think we'd make it through one Mars winter.
7245553268,Thu Dec 31 19:52:21 +0000 2009,@postshaggy The missions have regular reviews to examine cost vs. science return to determine future funding. Next review is February.
7244640681,Thu Dec 31 19:21:17 +0000 2009,Spirit celebrates an amazing 6 yrs on Mars on Jan 3.  Her future may be uncertain but don't count her out yet! http://bit.ly/80hlkb

7015730398,Thu Dec 24 23:56:48 +0000 2009,@rmichem No, Spirit's wheels are still stuck in the deep soil.  Keep fingers crossed..
7015590486,Thu Dec 24 23:50:58 +0000 2009,Oppy is using the rock abrasion tool to grind into a rock named Marquette Island, aiming for a depth of about 2mm (at 1.5 mm so far).
7015518887,Thu Dec 24 23:48:01 +0000 2009,Spirit will attempt a drive on Christmas Day using different wheels at different speeds in hopes to improve traction. #FreeSpirit
6948947791,Wed Dec 23 01:35:19 +0000 2009,@jabesse Unfortunately, Spirit's arm isn't strong enough to push (plus it could damage science instruments at the end of the arm).
6948927205,Wed Dec 23 01:34:35 +0000 2009,@Ryan Abbott Spirit can use steering motors to change the angle of front/rear wheels. It's not clear if this would help or dig in deeper.
6900942887,Mon Dec 21 18:17:19 +0000 2009,@polarisdotca The right-front wheel, which stopped in 2006, has turned on some recent drive attempts but not on all of them.
6742138126,Wed Dec 16 21:09:15 +0000 2009,Welcome back MRO! Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter resumes science activities after a 3.5 month hiatus.  All instruments are on.
6711929661,Tue Dec 15 23:40:18 +0000 2009,That's our girl! Spirit surprises team w/ slight movement in right-front wheel. It hadn't moved since March 2006: http://bit.ly/77PpJe
6551003317,Fri Dec 11 01:24:28 +0000 2009,Spirit's rear wheel continues to be an issue; team looking at drivability if only 4 out of 6 wheels operate. http://bit.ly/7x89EI
6487185650,Wed Dec 09 04:28:23 +0000 2009,@alicesastroinfo Genders for the rovers? Not officially but team members refer to both as females  -- they are our "ships" to Mars.
6448434503,Tue Dec 08 01:03:43 +0000 2009,No one said it would be easy: Engineers continue to test Spirit's rear wheel to determine why it's showing unusually high resistance
6327185462,Fri Dec 04 04:29:50 +0000 2009,@hdcnews It's a great idea, but Spirit isn't able to grab.  A push maybe, but there's not enough stones within reach to use .
6327119814,Fri Dec 04 04:27:05 +0000 2009,@flyingfreak Actually, Opportunity is way on the other side of Mars so it can't come over to help. We are looking at temps, though.
6327067103,Fri Dec 04 04:24:56 +0000 2009,@fallenbit Unfortunately, Spirit's arm isn't strong enough to push (plus it could damage sci instruments at end of arm).
6327034759,Fri Dec 04 04:23:36 +0000 2009,@mattpig The lithium-ion batteries on both rovers continue to do very well (much better than the one in your cell phone)!
6326165485,Fri Dec 04 03:49:27 +0000 2009,@iGOiAM The idea has been looked at closely. Verdict: Arm isn't strong enough  & it could cause serious damage to sci instruments.
6326090756,Fri Dec 04 03:46:36 +0000 2009,Mars orbiter Odyssey is out of safe mode & back in the game! 1st task was a comm relay for Spirit; on Friday Odyssey resumes sci ops.
6316736897,Thu Dec 03 22:10:27 +0000 2009,@ecca_au Thanks for suggestions. The wheels cannot retract, & the arm exerts only 14 lbs of force while the rover weighs 150 lbs on Mars.
6316674368,Thu Dec 03 22:08:18 +0000 2009,@iGOiAM Not giving up! Engineers are doing more diagnostic tests before sending new commands. And no, the arm cannot support rover weight.
6218813874,Tue Dec 01 00:45:21 +0000 2009,@Mannheimkathy2 The Lego "Astrobot" DVD carrying nearly 4 million names is on both Spirit and Oppty.  http://bit.ly/8nLcdz
6218761779,Tue Dec 01 00:43:30 +0000 2009,@brianyee0 The situation will be monitored on a rolling basis. NASA indicated a Feb. review will assess progress.
6036056068,Wed Nov 25 01:23:55 +0000 2009,@Chaoticwhizz Spirit has been exploring Mars for nearly 6 years, far surpassing the original 90-day mission.
5995186595,Tue Nov 24 01:56:21 +0000 2009,Spirit experienced a right-rear wheel stall on Sol 2092. Diagnostics will be run.  Next drive no sooner than Wed. http://bit.ly/7tuHiy
5980656464,Mon Nov 23 16:32:50 +0000 2009,@whyj Thanks for the suggestion, but the rovers can't rock back & forth. Also, we're being very careful of the rock under the rover belly.
5883187421,Fri Nov 20 07:21:18 +0000 2009,Spirit takes a baby step in the right direction. Before-&-after image comparison shows a tiny forward movement. http://bit.ly/2fML5x

5414834076,Wed Nov 04 07:13:59 +0000 2009,@doug_ellison team thinks it could be due to slight settling after diagnostic tests on 1916, 1933 & IDD work on 1998, 2072. Great catch.
4901915090,Thu Oct 15 23:49:31 +0000 2009,Oppy finished examining a 2nd meteorite [ http://twitpic.com/lo5za ] & is on the road again. Total odometry is 18 km/11 miles.

2368292578,Sun Jun 28 05:06:07 +0000 2009,@boofly44 It's not being tested.  It's considered too risky to the instruments and not really strong enough.
2352581836,Sat Jun 27 00:42:11 +0000 2009,New video on the Free Spirit site shows how the rover team is creating a "Mars-scape" on Earth.  http://bit.ly/freespirit

2023973051,Thu Jun 04 01:31:30 +0000 2009,-@ubergooroo Recreating the Mars soil is a challenge. Here's the recipe engineers used in 2005 when Oppy got stuck: http://bit.ly/eSQ1g

2023701722,Thu Jun 04 01:05:30 +0000 2009,@alpha_dk Yes, gravity/weight difference is taken into account. Other issue is to recreate the soil type - silty or gritty, pebbles, etc.
2023590384,Thu Jun 04 00:54:48 +0000 2009,Engineers are reviewing the images to determine best way to drive Spirit out.  They'll recreate the same situation using a test rover.
2023476190,Thu Jun 04 00:43:23 +0000 2009,http://twitpic.com/6ki1j - Spirit used a microscopic camera on her arm to take a peek at her belly & wheels in deep sand.
1965626808,Fri May 29 23:15:14 +0000 2009,@jimbergman it's another idea that's been discussed by the team. Spirit can't pick up rocks, but perhaps can  push them.
1965145879,Fri May 29 22:24:39 +0000 2009,Thanks to @Nancy_A for this story on Julian, Spirit efforts to get free http://tinyurl.com/73fm3

1944229537,Thu May 28 05:27:04 +0000 2009,@theonetruebix Absolutely a born engineer. We need more Julians.
1943283795,Thu May 28 03:36:15 +0000 2009,Julian's idea to use the arm is a good start. It's not strong enough to push the rover out but perhaps it can be used in other ways.
1943045851,Thu May 28 03:12:27 +0000 2009,Spirit gets a little help from her friends. 7 yr old Julian sent his idea to free Spirit from the sand :-) http://twitpic.com/63flv

1876502956,Thu May 21 23:27:39 +0000 2009,Opportunity's findings at Victoria crater are published in the journal Science. More info here:  http://bit.ly/i6Au
1873876136,Thu May 21 18:36:03 +0000 2009,Looking at data returned by Oppy from Victoria crater, scientists report a history of wind and water over billions of years.
1771137253,Tue May 12 06:18:56 +0000 2009,Oppy's wheel issue is intermittant: occasional spikes in current drawn by a front wheel indicating friction. With TLC, it's working
1770647284,Tue May 12 04:52:34 +0000 2009,@estcst Each rover came equipped with six-wheel drive. Both have driven many times farther than expected, each has 1 bad wheel now.
1770383340,Tue May 12 04:14:49 +0000 2009,@Dsquared10 @FurrySaint Oppy's sand trap exit took 1 month, w/ each drive-day carefully studied + tried on ground-based rover in testbed.
1769909535,Tue May 12 03:14:40 +0000 2009,@tsteuver @LJespersen Yes, Spirit's bad right-front wheel will make it a challenge. She drives backwards dragging that wheel.
1769818387,Tue May 12 03:04:03 +0000 2009,@matthewnet it's a very good question, but engineers determined that wipers (& other mechanisms) could cause more harm to solar cells.
1769806225,Tue May 12 03:02:36 +0000 2009,@NegativeK In 2005 vid, Oppy slowly did 192 meters (629 ft) worth of wheel rotations to move just one meter to get out of deep sand.
1769606876,Tue May 12 02:39:07 +0000 2009,Oppy was stuck in sand for 5 weeks in 2005; engineers decided best way was to back out. This vid shows how it worked: http://tr.im/l5QF
1769395722,Tue May 12 02:14:47 +0000 2009,Engineers are examing pics & data. They'll work w/ a twin rover model at JPL to develop an exit strategy. More at: http://tr.im/l5I9
1769291963,Tue May 12 02:03:08 +0000 2009,A little help here? Spirit has driven into soft ground, burying her wheels halfway. Engineers are working plans to extricate her.

1605856962,Fri Apr 24 17:59:55 +0000 2009,@solartweets All those systems (& more) were considered, but engineers decided they could cause more harm. They went with "cause no harm."
1605652096,Fri Apr 24 17:35:25 +0000 2009,Until 2007, when a massive dust storm hit Spirit and Oppy, they were producing ~700 watt hours. 2007 video: http://tr.im/jCY4
1605600960,Fri Apr 24 17:29:18 +0000 2009,Good Q from @DavidCWG. In 2004, solar arrays produced 900 watt hours per sol. Today Spirit produces 306 watt hours; Oppy 447.
1605508757,Fri Apr 24 17:17:59 +0000 2009,Opportunity has the pedal to the metal, traveling almost 1/2 kilometer this week on the way to Endeavour crater.
1605466934,Fri Apr 24 17:12:44 +0000 2009,Spirit is better behaved & driving again, headed for a spot  500 feet away. Her power is up 10% after a nice dust-clearing breeze.

1211361505,Sun Feb 15 02:48:31 +0000 2009,I was referring to @marssciencelab, the next rover to Mars now being built. It is powered by a RTG (as are Voyagers 1 & 2, & Cassini).
1208600134,Sat Feb 14 01:58:31 +0000 2009,We'll do a blog post to explain devices considered and the downsides of them. Good news: next rover @marsscience lab is not solar powered.
1208206080,Fri Feb 13 23:17:49 +0000 2009,@GPHemsley Not at all! Lasting 5 years shows they made a great decision. Wipers ran greater risks, including damage to solar cells.
1208179783,Fri Feb 13 23:08:10 +0000 2009,Lot's of people ask, why no dust wipers on the rovers? Engineers looked into many cleaning options but found more reasons to go without them
1206723907,Fri Feb 13 15:49:24 +0000 2009,You can read about the energy boost here: http://is.gd/jqHD  or watch a video report with rover driver Matt Heverly: http://is.gd/jqGU
1206690917,Fri Feb 13 15:39:55 +0000 2009,Spirit has a bit more energy!  A nice Martian wind blew away some dust from her solar panels, giving her a boost of 30 watt-hours/day.
1188329291,Sun Feb 08 07:05:16 +0000 2009,Sorry. IDD is Instrument Deployment Device, aka "robotic arm." RAT is the Rock Abrasion Tool, a grinding wheel & brush on the arm.

1157162931,Thu Jan 29 01:26:22 +0000 2009,Better news from Spirit:  She found the sun, just not where she expected.  I'm sure it happens to all of us :)  Diagnosis continues.

1122384997,Thu Jan 15 23:58:38 +0000 2009,Miles: "the world is shifting below the media's feet.  Today's bloggers, tweeters, etc, can compete with an army of journalists.
1122382077,Thu Jan 15 23:57:04 +0000 2009,Miles: "what happened to the media? Why do we see more Brittany Spears than Tony Spear? (Tony was the project mgr of Mars Pathfinder). LOL
1122377249,Thu Jan 15 23:54:31 +0000 2009,Miles:  "You are big gamblers. You risk a whole career on a 6 minute plunge in the atmosphere. That's ALL IN baby."
1122372746,Thu Jan 15 23:52:16 +0000 2009,Miles: "Spirit and Oppy are literally, figuratively "rock stars." If I had their Q rating I'd still be at CNN"
1122365757,Thu Jan 15 23:48:45 +0000 2009,Oh yes right! EDGAR Rice Burroughs. Apologies and thanks for correcting me.

1073885487,Tue Dec 23 07:14:00 +0000 2008,Spirit tried to back-up off of 'Home Plate' but with some slippage. She'll probably drive forward & take the long way to the next target.
1073842451,Tue Dec 23 06:30:36 +0000 2008,Solar conjunction (and the comm blackout) is over, now both rovers are looking to move to their next science locations.
1025253979,Wed Nov 26 21:13:48 +0000 2008,@ppinheiro76 Oppy won't drive during conjunction. She'll stay parked & will take readings of a target with the Moessbauer (MB) spectrometer.

1004474142,Thu Nov 13 21:59:05 +0000 2008,@qcait Winter at the rover locations (south hemi) is ending. It was @marsphoenix (in the far north), that succumbed to the onset of autumn.
1004463979,Thu Nov 13 21:52:20 +0000 2008,That's our girl! Spirit communicated today just as instructed. Battery charge didn't go low enough to trigger fault-protection. Big cheers.
1003360764,Thu Nov 13 05:18:22 +0000 2008,During a dust storm, it is the dust kicked up into the atmosphere that is the biggest problem, reducing sunlight reaching solar panels.
1003345023,Thu Nov 13 05:02:43 +0000 2008,Questions re: brushes/wipers: They weren't needed for the initial 90-day mission, & periodic wind gusts have done a good job cleaning panels
