130380824137830400,Sat Oct 29 20:29:45 +0000 2011,@TheSteamer but wildcards are the whole reason we have bullshit champions like the Cardinals and Marlins, not to mention '04 Red Sox

130158392634392580,Sat Oct 29 05:45:53 +0000 2011,If we're honoring teams that were hot for 2 months and stunk the rest of the year, I declare the Cleveland Indians World Series co-champions
130157922201251840,Sat Oct 29 05:44:01 +0000 2011,@marknabours The Indians were also really hot for about 2 months this season. Just sayin'.
130157033952522240,Sat Oct 29 05:40:29 +0000 2011,@marknabours just reminding you what a deserving World Series champion looks like.
130156958476025860,Sat Oct 29 05:40:11 +0000 2011,@jtbed if they were really the greatest pitching staff of all time, they would have made the playoffs this year. same exact staff.
130155192040697860,Sat Oct 29 05:33:10 +0000 2011,@marknabours but congrats on winning only due to one other team's incredible ineptitude.
130155123409301500,Sat Oct 29 05:32:54 +0000 2011,@marknabours a lot more than one Braves victory separated the 96 98 99 00 Yankees from their trophies. That's why they'll be remembered.
130153710771900420,Sat Oct 29 05:27:17 +0000 2011,@marknabours ok, congrats, Detroit and Milwaukee are the only cities that remember your other forgettable championships.
130153516596596740,Sat Oct 29 05:26:31 +0000 2011,@marknabours If the Braves could have won a single god damn game in September your team would be playing golf today.
130152932078391300,Sat Oct 29 05:24:11 +0000 2011,@marknabours yes, I regularly watch baseball, which is why I'm pissed a team that was totally off the radar all season snuck in and stole it
130152220367921150,Sat Oct 29 05:21:22 +0000 2011,@marknabours The Cardinals won the World Series in 1982 and nobody outside St. Louis remembers that one either.
130150213380874240,Sat Oct 29 05:13:23 +0000 2011,@jcoleman I would not be complaining if the Phillies had won.
130149951886995460,Sat Oct 29 05:12:21 +0000 2011,@marknabours 2006 Cardinals were even worse than this year's teams. Meaningless victories that nobody outside St. Louis will remember.
130149817103036420,Sat Oct 29 05:11:49 +0000 2011,@marknabours shitty team, well-timed hot streak. Just like last year's Giants and the 2003 Marlins.
130149712526442500,Sat Oct 29 05:11:24 +0000 2011,@kev_nz happens all the time. Just like the Marlins in '97 and '03, last year's Giants, '06 Cardinals. Shitty teams, well timed hot streaks.

130143659118166020,Sat Oct 29 04:47:20 +0000 2011,@JeffBNimble no, it means they had a well-timed hot streak.
130141779533111300,Sat Oct 29 04:39:52 +0000 2011,Let's go back to the old playoff format: best team in each league goes directly to World Series. Guarantees a deserving champion.
130141473659289600,Sat Oct 29 04:38:39 +0000 2011,@MattClipper a distant distant second. They'll never even make it to half as many.
130140952407973890,Sat Oct 29 04:36:35 +0000 2011,@polotek it's sad when undeserving teams are rewarded for a well-timed winning streak.
130139968759795710,Sat Oct 29 04:32:41 +0000 2011,Remember when great teams would win the World Series, like the late 90's Yankees? Last two years we get mediocre lucky winners. Sad.
130021412445491200,Fri Oct 28 20:41:35 +0000 2011,@pearapps the current "slide out" navigation is better, but I still think it's too complex. Too many choices in that list are worthless.

128919736707846140,Tue Oct 25 19:43:55 +0000 2011,New blog post in which I speculate on the future of Apple TV: http://t.co/vS8j8ihE
128902651697037310,Tue Oct 25 18:36:01 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos sorry if I misunderstood. we'll just have to wait and see what Apple does.
128899227601469440,Tue Oct 25 18:22:25 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos Content/games on the App Store is approaching the depth of what's available through cable/satellite and game consoles.
128898731637604350,Tue Oct 25 18:20:27 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos again, when has Apple ever cared about compatibility with legacy ecosystems? Are you a Microsoft guy? I don't think you get it.
128898305974472700,Tue Oct 25 18:18:45 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos I agree with that.
128897657375698940,Tue Oct 25 18:16:10 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos I never said anything about Siri. I'm sure it will be a big part of it.
128895107796697090,Tue Oct 25 18:06:03 +0000 2011,@mikesax why would you surf on the TV? You watch videos on the TV. The iPad is for choosing what to watch.
128895005870931970,Tue Oct 25 18:05:38 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos it doesn't have to be for everyone. This is Apple. They've never had a problem finding customers willing to spend money.
128894593696673800,Tue Oct 25 18:04:00 +0000 2011,@mikesax @kosmatos no only look at the iPad/iPhone while choosing what to look at, then look up at the TV
128894412041371650,Tue Oct 25 18:03:17 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos just keep an iPad in the living room. they'll come down in price
128893347724148740,Tue Oct 25 17:59:03 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos it will be the only way. I don't see what the problem is.
128893029414207490,Tue Oct 25 17:57:47 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos you're way underestimating what a great remote an iPad makes. No up/down, no channel numbers, just touch what you want to watch
128892001482588160,Tue Oct 25 17:53:42 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos it may "stink" to you but that's just what makes sense for Apple. Leverage the app ecosystem, not legacy cable and such.
128891640097153020,Tue Oct 25 17:52:16 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos the iPad/iPhone is the remote. No on/off switch on the TV, just start using an app.
128889881274499070,Tue Oct 25 17:45:17 +0000 2011,@Kosmatos because the iOS app platform is HUGE and there is a ton of content+games there waiting for a big TV to stream to.
128888990496600060,Tue Oct 25 17:41:44 +0000 2011,@shaver that could be it
128888972872126460,Tue Oct 25 17:41:40 +0000 2011,@johncblandii yes. Limiting customers to those who own an iPad or iPhone would not deter Apple.
128888122380525570,Tue Oct 25 17:38:17 +0000 2011,Any discussion of a future Apple TV has to start and end with Airplay. Maybe a TV with built-in wifi router to ensure fast connection.

127127725805801470,Thu Oct 20 21:03:06 +0000 2011,@doctyper it gives it some spice, somewhere in between lemon and cinnamon. If you're ever in SF try the turkish coffee at Philz.

122117459384864770,Fri Oct 07 01:14:05 +0000 2011,@KuraFire but native apps would be able to go to other native apps if you have them installed.
122117387683250180,Fri Oct 07 01:13:48 +0000 2011,@KuraFire the point is to use only web URLs everywhere. I can't override Safari so it would always load the web version.

122084504373428220,Thu Oct 06 23:03:08 +0000 2011,@raccettura guess there'd need to be a policy for claiming protocol schemes. At least domains can be claimed by just validating a URL.
122084137233416200,Thu Oct 06 23:01:41 +0000 2011,@joshaber iOS allows you to detect if a URL handler is supported, which can tell you if the app is installed or not.

121686215807344640,Wed Oct 05 20:40:29 +0000 2011,It was a major bore when I got my iPhone 3GS. Not much new to see other than smoother animations. The 4S at least has Siri to play with.
121674215555465220,Wed Oct 05 19:52:48 +0000 2011,If next year's iPhone is called "iPhone 4G", will people waiting for the "iPhone 5" still call it a disappointment?
121452010611544060,Wed Oct 05 05:09:50 +0000 2011,@felipecn they talked about a whole bunch of other tech stuff that is just as esoteric as ram and gigahertz to the average consumer.
121372883581804540,Tue Oct 04 23:55:25 +0000 2011,@RussB yeah I'm getting old and don't tend to over engineer as much as I used to
121295949250301950,Tue Oct 04 18:49:42 +0000 2011,@PSUFan5 this is true.
121295755007901700,Tue Oct 04 18:48:56 +0000 2011,I'm not complaining.  The 4S sounds like a great incremental upgrade and I'll get one. iOS 5 is way more exciting than the 4S though.
121294400964919300,Tue Oct 04 18:43:33 +0000 2011,Yeah, they always discuss specs at these events, but did you see that TV commercial showing the silicon and the lens system? How PC-like.
121293256322588670,Tue Oct 04 18:39:00 +0000 2011,For all that talk about how Apple doesn't market tech specs, geeky internals sure do seem to be the main promotional focus of the iPhone 4S.
121291301223280640,Tue Oct 04 18:31:14 +0000 2011,I'll get excited about Siri when there's an API for third-party apps to take advantage of it.
121286077066649600,Tue Oct 04 18:10:28 +0000 2011,@ppk it's pretty damn important to me and a lot of people. I have an SLR but still take 90% of my photos with my iPhone
121285399552344060,Tue Oct 04 18:07:47 +0000 2011,All I want from the new iPhone camera is for it to not stall for 10 seconds before opening up.

120976668335673340,Mon Oct 03 21:41:00 +0000 2011,Upgrading EC2 instance seems to have done the trick (fingers crossed). Doubles my EC2 monthly bill from $15 to $30 but that's still not bad.

118437722519121920,Mon Sep 26 21:32:08 +0000 2011,Three20, by the way, was an attempt to bring web conventions (links, CSS) to iOS. I wouldn't do that again. Will follow Apple conventions.

118433764618670080,Mon Sep 26 21:16:24 +0000 2011,You know how loading a PDF in your browser feels like entering an archaic world? That's what embedded web browsers feel like on iOS/Android.
118433515837726720,Mon Sep 26 21:15:25 +0000 2011,@ikhare because the web platform feels handicapped without pervasive touch scrolling, like native apps can do
118432821395202050,Mon Sep 26 21:12:39 +0000 2011,@derek my definition was based on the question, how much can you remove before it is no longer the web?
118430949095641090,Mon Sep 26 21:05:13 +0000 2011,Inability to control the timing of rendering leads to flickering and stalling that I just can't avoid. In Cocoa this would be trivial.
118430761987739650,Mon Sep 26 21:04:28 +0000 2011,Trying to make Scrollability feel 100% native is driving me back to iOS. I can only hack WebKit so much before I throw up my hands.

118190751413829630,Mon Sep 26 05:10:45 +0000 2011,@jonathanstark to be web, you have to have URLs that can be accessed anywhere, even if what gets loaded is optimized for different clients
118190354477486080,Mon Sep 26 05:09:11 +0000 2011,@jonathanstark well, except for the parts that use client-specific APIs. It's subjective where to draw the line

118185542293790720,Mon Sep 26 04:50:03 +0000 2011,@dalmaer @jonathanstark I would call that web. If *all* the code and data come from the Internet, it's ok to use special device APIs
118184509819723780,Mon Sep 26 04:45:57 +0000 2011,@jonathanstark if it's accessing the same exact URLs I can reach in Safari, then yes. If all the HTML/JS/CSS is local, then no.

117051161944670200,Fri Sep 23 01:42:26 +0000 2011,@mdhughes quite often the tradeoff is a low-quality, zero-install or nothing. The friction to installing an app is a high barrier to entry
117043747417628670,Fri Sep 23 01:12:58 +0000 2011,@mdhughes the app must be installed in advance for that to work, makes it a non-starter

116987940684566530,Thu Sep 22 21:31:13 +0000 2011,@johnallsopp all I want the web to be is relevant, and continuing to serve apps through a browser, not an app store.
116987827144753150,Thu Sep 22 21:30:46 +0000 2011,@johnallsopp that's great, I appreciate TBL's values, but they're not enough to sustain the web forever

116986469972848640,Thu Sep 22 21:25:22 +0000 2011,@johnallsopp here's the challenge the web faces: survival. declining usage. web developers learning objective-C and java
116986344361824260,Thu Sep 22 21:24:52 +0000 2011,@johnallsopp stuff like "The web faces challenges far far greater (and has goals far more important." There's your arrogance.

116678784509415420,Thu Sep 22 01:02:44 +0000 2011,The key is that the Internet remains free and owned by nobody, but web technologies are different and need an owner.
116678546486865920,Thu Sep 22 01:01:47 +0000 2011,@jordanekay it's the network that should have no owner, not the client technologies.
116678214860021760,Thu Sep 22 01:00:28 +0000 2011,My definition of the web: applications loaded just in time over the net with no gatekeeper. That's what we need to save. It's not just HTML.

116650022946357250,Wed Sep 21 23:08:27 +0000 2011,@steipete I meant you should try the new feature in iOS 5 you were referencing before you claim it solves the problem you think it solves.
116649203052183550,Wed Sep 21 23:05:11 +0000 2011,@steipete maybe you should try actually using it before you make that claim

116643658060664830,Wed Sep 21 22:43:09 +0000 2011,@KuraFire that is, as long as I keep the animated element at 1024x1024 or smaller.
116643520202280960,Wed Sep 21 22:42:37 +0000 2011,@KuraFire yeah exactly. works beautifully with just text and background colors. on iOS 5 though it can handle anything.
116643081532616700,Wed Sep 21 22:40:52 +0000 2011,To be more specific, CSS keyframe animations on image-heavy elements stutter badly on iOS 4. My photo gallery scroller feels awful.

116401214865932290,Wed Sep 21 06:39:46 +0000 2011,@smfr it appears that you create and paint to textures at the start of the animation and dispose of them at the end. Correct?
116399592664334340,Wed Sep 21 06:33:20 +0000 2011,@smfr I guess "stuttery" is the best description. Tons of dropped frames while things repaint in the middle of the animation.

116321758428151800,Wed Sep 21 01:24:03 +0000 2011,WebKit must use 1024x1024 pixel buffers for 3D transformed content, because things get SLOOOW when you animate things larger than that.
116316552298643460,Wed Sep 21 01:03:21 +0000 2011,@designbyadmiral yes i can
116314155094515710,Wed Sep 21 00:53:50 +0000 2011,@slightlylate so true. I remember when XUL was driving CSS forward because the Gecko team served the demands of the Netscape UI team.
116313225464786940,Wed Sep 21 00:50:08 +0000 2011,@slightlylate yes, you just need to get Chrome into Android and I'll be far less likely to kvetch.
116312668876447740,Wed Sep 21 00:47:55 +0000 2011,@slightlylate I blame lack of leadership from runtime engineers. It only takes one guy. Remember when Dave Hyatt was making WebKit go fast?
116311756594352130,Wed Sep 21 00:44:18 +0000 2011,@slightlylate do you think existence of W3C discourages WebKit/Gecko devs from making effort to move faster, try new things?
116310654813609980,Wed Sep 21 00:39:55 +0000 2011,@slightlylate solution: invent time machine, go back and make Mosaic FOSS, watch web evolve like Linux did.
116300821536325630,Wed Sep 21 00:00:51 +0000 2011,@BrendanEich different webkits are still easier to deal with than webkit/gecko/IE/opera differences

116292923288592380,Tue Sep 20 23:29:28 +0000 2011,We should dissolve the W3C and run the web like an open source project. No more specs, just commits. Does Linux need a standards body?

108585681512710140,Tue Aug 30 17:03:38 +0000 2011,@grigs yeah that would be a huge step up. I wish I knew the reason Apple has kept that API private.

108583881854291970,Tue Aug 30 16:56:29 +0000 2011,@grigs sort of. that replies on finger-like input devices that squoosh down against the glass. What I want is a precise pen.
108582458047479800,Tue Aug 30 16:50:50 +0000 2011,@me1000 yes, it's great, but finger input is less than ideal

108445263881961470,Tue Aug 30 07:45:40 +0000 2011,@alex_gibson @smfr dude, if you don't have touch events, you can't do gestures in javascript, and you need to do them to feel native
108444621515931650,Tue Aug 30 07:43:07 +0000 2011,@alex_gibson gestures are used all over the OS and they beg to be used similarly within web pages
108443945159229440,Tue Aug 30 07:40:25 +0000 2011,@alex_gibson no, you can't use mouse events, you need multitouch events. have you used Lion?

108435599517679620,Tue Aug 30 07:07:16 +0000 2011,@rudolfrck the only events that really matter are unload and ondomcontentload

108411300127846400,Tue Aug 30 05:30:42 +0000 2011,@niccai yes. each JS file can require the CSS files it needs, and JS templates can extend others for reuse
108409159971647490,Tue Aug 30 05:22:12 +0000 2011,@niccai it's all js templates, there's no static HTML at any level. the js templates create the DOM
108407541393924100,Tue Aug 30 05:15:46 +0000 2011,@niccai no I have a JavaScript-based template language
108407468283011070,Tue Aug 30 05:15:29 +0000 2011,@cvilly Used to do that in Snow Leopard, can't make it work in Lion, even when I remap the three finger gesture. Hmm..
108388170730717180,Tue Aug 30 03:58:48 +0000 2011,@jordanekay nope
108387777854443520,Tue Aug 30 03:57:14 +0000 2011,@jordanekay only reason they can't is Apple doesn't let them (yet)

108385559545778180,Tue Aug 30 03:48:25 +0000 2011,@cstromme on Lion it's two finger swipe. 3 finger is for spaces

108351747352821760,Tue Aug 30 01:34:04 +0000 2011,I'm using the JS templating library that is used by Firebug to generate all its UI. I wrote it 5 years ago, just now modernizing it.

108350418437931000,Tue Aug 30 01:28:47 +0000 2011,@KuraFire but I literally have no ability to write HTML, a stub HTML file is generated by my Node.js app based on metadata in my JS files.
108350225999077380,Tue Aug 30 01:28:01 +0000 2011,@KuraFire there are plenty of JS frameworks like SproutCore that want you to write an HTML file that basically just has script/style tags.
108349283278917630,Tue Aug 30 01:24:16 +0000 2011,@endtwist I write my templates in straight JS, not an HTML fragment that I have to parse

108341258602299400,Tue Aug 30 00:52:23 +0000 2011,The new way I'm making web apps is you don't get to author an HTML file. The "page" is just a JS file. Static markup is pointless now.
108328857316229120,Tue Aug 30 00:03:06 +0000 2011,@smfr on a related note, on lion we desperately need touch events in desktop webkit. I can't currently emulate scrolling there like on iOS

81397152772915200,Thu Jun 16 16:26:08 +0000 2011,So WebGL *is* in iOS 5 but is disabled for all except for iAds? I can't wait to hear the explanation for this one. http://t.co/ATdhjLk
81177544329662460,Thu Jun 16 01:53:29 +0000 2011,@apere006 you're missing the point. If the app is not installed the link is a dead end
81058660654133250,Wed Jun 15 18:01:05 +0000 2011,@axiixc @gruber exactly, that's the problem. You need 2 links. One to install app, one to get to the specific content
81056612885860350,Wed Jun 15 17:52:57 +0000 2011,@gruber they take you to an install page, but you can't link directly to content, and the app store adds another click and a download wait
81049491419037700,Wed Jun 15 17:24:39 +0000 2011,@xmlhack @gruber if it's hard that's google's fault. The platform makes it possible and easy

81045412026400770,Wed Jun 15 17:08:26 +0000 2011,@DavidKaneda @gruber with gdocs, one click of a link and a user who has never used docs before is editing your document. no app store bounce
81044781773492220,Wed Jun 15 17:05:56 +0000 2011,@DavidKaneda @gruber he argued that sharing was equally possible on both, but the installation speedbump makes it much harder with apps
81043024448196600,Wed Jun 15 16:58:57 +0000 2011,@gruber Your last essay overlooked the power of the hyperlink in UX. With apps, you can't share unless the other user has installed the app.

77973748350857220,Tue Jun 07 05:42:44 +0000 2011,@jordanekay when you grow up being free to publish on a medium like the web, and then lose that freedom, openness suddenly matters.

71639239804207100,Fri May 20 18:11:40 +0000 2011,@thomasfuchs I noticed that iAds recycles table rows to avoid that problem, just like UITableView does. Don't know if it performs well
71637311888162820,Fri May 20 18:04:00 +0000 2011,@thomasfuchs have you tried using the transitionend even to start each new transition yourself, instead of keyframes?

71635808007897090,Fri May 20 17:58:02 +0000 2011,@thomasfuchs you mean if you tried to do it in pure CSS? Presumably you could calculate the CSS transition sequence in JS

71446846333124610,Fri May 20 05:27:10 +0000 2011,For the record, Scrollability is copying the UITableView scrolling physics, not UIWebView. Safari scrolling is much much slower.
71446492249997310,Fri May 20 05:25:45 +0000 2011,@jdalton thx, going through screencast now... scrolling in Safari is different than table views used in apps. Compare with Mail, for example

71426590696935420,Fri May 20 04:06:40 +0000 2011,@edog1203 I added some friction to the middle. If you have a sec let me know if it feels better to you.
71422982869884930,Fri May 20 03:52:20 +0000 2011,@edog1203 you're right, way too fast in the middle. I had it right and then I fixed another bug and gah... metaphysics.
71419071937253380,Fri May 20 03:36:48 +0000 2011,@Jason_Diaz sadly I can't solve that, as far as I know there's no javascript event to respond to a status bar tap

6823767598694400,Mon Nov 22 21:38:07 +0000 2010,I fear it's not Apple's desire to neuter AirPlay, but the entertainment industry which pushed them to do it.
6823111940902912,Mon Nov 22 21:35:31 +0000 2010,@drunknbass you need me to explain why you'd want to watch a video on a TV instead of a handheld device?

414496568909824,Fri Nov 05 05:09:58 +0000 2010,@Lessien I don't argue that. Winners and losers should be on merit, not Fed/gov mandate. Have fun unpacking.
414014442045440,Fri Nov 05 05:08:03 +0000 2010,@Lessien free market is a loaded term. to me it is a market with zero coercive interference. you need that for gold to reflect market intent
412266725908480,Fri Nov 05 05:01:06 +0000 2010,@Lessien Yeah but mercantilist != free market.
412056570298368,Fri Nov 05 05:00:16 +0000 2010,@Lessien how do you define "it works"? Krugman thinks it "works" if everyone has a job but lives paycheck to paycheck, gov't has war money.

408381336592384,Fri Nov 05 04:45:40 +0000 2010,@Lessien history has no examples of gold being seriously tried. it only has examples of paper money failing for the same reasons every time.

407853013663745,Fri Nov 05 04:43:34 +0000 2010,@Lessien if you want to read papers, austrian economists on mises.org wrote plenty of them.

406003476598784,Fri Nov 05 04:36:13 +0000 2010,@Lessien hard to prove when no one has tried it during post-industrial era. Doesn't mean you can disprove it.

403918483890176,Fri Nov 05 04:27:56 +0000 2010,@Lessien the argument I am making is to have a gold standard, no Fed, no fractional-reserve distortions, and then gold works.
403770131357696,Fri Nov 05 04:27:20 +0000 2010,@Lessien the arguments in favor of gold don't hold up in a world ruled by Fed-manipulated currencies and fractional-reserve banking.
403410411061248,Fri Nov 05 04:25:55 +0000 2010,@einarvollset there's a reason the great depression didn't end until after FDR was dead.
401628427452416,Fri Nov 05 04:18:50 +0000 2010,@Lessien Gold is only "pegged" to productivity.
400058889543680,Fri Nov 05 04:12:36 +0000 2010,No point to create jobs if jobs are to work on marginal projects that only exist due to cheap money. Project fails, bubble pops, jobs vanish
398744738594816,Fri Nov 05 04:07:22 +0000 2010,@PuckPuck QE creates jobs to work on high-risk gambles financed with cheap money, jobs that disappear when the speculation fails.
398460985548800,Fri Nov 05 04:06:15 +0000 2010,@PuckPuck if you keep asking for jobs at all costs without asking if the jobs are sustainable, we'll keep having bubbles and depressions.

397992716664832,Fri Nov 05 04:04:23 +0000 2010,@Lessien Hard to criticize gold when it has always coexisted with fractional-reserve banking, the other lever of currency manipulation.
396648454819842,Fri Nov 05 03:59:03 +0000 2010,@ikirigin why would their normative value go up when there is an oversupply of houses from the last bubble?
392736003850240,Fri Nov 05 03:43:30 +0000 2010,@Lessien I'm suggesting we'd be better off with gold standard and no Fed.  Unlikely, but not impossible that we are forced to revert back.

29409640672,Mon Nov 01 21:57:00 +0000 2010,@jmreidy That's a myth. The constitution was designed to foster the growth of the state. Contrast it with the articles of confederation.

29409345251,Mon Nov 01 21:52:57 +0000 2010,@hedron it means I think that government is fundamentally immoral no matter what the supposed principles of any political party are.
29409255670,Mon Nov 01 21:51:43 +0000 2010,@paulsmith I agree, gov't is the symptom, the disease is in everyday people and their willingness to support aggression if it favors them.

29408641851,Mon Nov 01 21:43:13 +0000 2010,@pjfry I feel good about things I've done to effect change without putting anyone in jail or in the grave.

27883325161,Wed Oct 20 00:23:03 +0000 2010,@risaacs99 like Rubin bragging about how downloading a months old code dump is the definition of open.
27883139741,Wed Oct 20 00:20:48 +0000 2010,@zdFYRashid spoken like someone who has never contributed to a full open source project.
27883053473,Wed Oct 20 00:19:44 +0000 2010,@risaacs99 I am saying they are doing the bare minimum, but boasting as if they are on the level of Linux or Firefox, or even Chrome OS.

27881276843,Tue Oct 19 23:58:04 +0000 2010,Point I am trying to make is, Rubin bickering with Jobs is a farce, because both refuse to share the one thing that matters: control.
27880578090,Tue Oct 19 23:49:18 +0000 2010,@jbilbob it's all relative, dude. Can't argue Google is doing bare minimum to meet the definition of open.

27879547989,Tue Oct 19 23:36:18 +0000 2010,I think it is the lack of visibility into daily progress that bothers me about Android more than the lack of write access.
27878912110,Tue Oct 19 23:28:22 +0000 2010,Until Android is read/write open, it's no different than iOS to me. Open source means sharing control with the community, not show and tell.

27876257267,Tue Oct 19 22:55:33 +0000 2010,Compare the Android "open source" model to Firefox or Linux if you want to see how disingenuous that "open" claim is.
27876055599,Tue Oct 19 22:52:59 +0000 2010,How does Android get away with the "open" claim when the source isn't public until major releases, and no one outside Google can check in?

24522199410,Wed Sep 15 00:17:06 +0000 2010,@litso hmm... infinite scrolling and scrollbars are usually an awkward combo.  I'd kill the scrollbar if I were them.
24522069091,Wed Sep 15 00:15:20 +0000 2010,@ffub two-finger scrolling on trackpads, my man.  or at least on Apple trackpads.
24522031241,Wed Sep 15 00:14:50 +0000 2010,@hansv_com yeah, scrollbars are pointless in the age of scroll wheels and trackpad scrolling.

24521812534,Wed Sep 15 00:11:53 +0000 2010,From videos/screens, appears new Twitter has no physical scrollbar for main column, requiring use of scroll wheel... if so, awesome.
24515713695,Tue Sep 14 22:48:17 +0000 2010,@dxpack because each store features and promotes its products differently, given devs more chances for exposure.

24509652245,Tue Sep 14 21:18:11 +0000 2010,@actionjaxon666 why you think apps are a special category of goods that benefit from a monopoly is beyond me.

24509047177,Tue Sep 14 21:08:34 +0000 2010,Confusing? There are many stores where I can buy a pair of pants but I don't find it confusing.
24508954074,Tue Sep 14 21:07:05 +0000 2010,@joestump no doubt, it would never happen, but if it did it could maintain the integrity of the app model while giving devs more flexibility
24508659858,Tue Sep 14 21:02:30 +0000 2010,Verizon App Store has me thinkin...what if Apple allowed 3rd party app stores and vetted those instead of apps directly? Competition is good

16992697048,Fri Jun 25 05:54:19 +0000 2010,So glad I got hi-res Macbook Pro screen.  iPad is now by far the worst screen of all my devices. I still love you anyway, iPad.
16958394722,Thu Jun 24 20:20:52 +0000 2010,@Papo2 yep. Good thing I'm a righty
16956591720,Thu Jun 24 19:57:40 +0000 2010,@TheSteamer worth it!
16950460516,Thu Jun 24 18:32:28 +0000 2010,On second thought, there is one big thing left to do, which is killing USB sync and going all cloud. Viva IPhone 5!
16947613172,Thu Jun 24 17:49:07 +0000 2010,@zenona yes good point about notifications.
16947174291,Thu Jun 24 17:42:13 +0000 2010,@bensstein yeah but pretty much everything they have done so far was widely foreseen.

16946234698,Thu Jun 24 17:27:47 +0000 2010,Have iPhone 4 and it's perfect. What is left for iPhone 5 but Verizon or 4G? I think we've reached a stabilization point.
16943989549,Thu Jun 24 16:54:19 +0000 2010,I've always been anti-case, but iPhone 4 is screaming for one. Gonna try to keep it naked for now but boy does it feel delicate.
16930185838,Thu Jun 24 13:45:56 +0000 2010,Longest iLine I've stood in since the original in '07.

16913894435,Thu Jun 24 08:05:07 +0000 2010,Not nearly as excited about getting no sleep to wait in line for iPhone 4 as I was for iPad, but I guess I'm glad I'm going...
16890973190,Thu Jun 24 01:03:40 +0000 2010,What was I thinking when I reserved iPhone 4 for in store pickup?
16873576855,Wed Jun 23 20:01:58 +0000 2010,New fluid http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/ nails it.  All pages should adapt like this in our new world of phone/tablet/desktop browsers.

16339312652,Wed Jun 16 22:16:31 +0000 2010,@edwk just the standard ipad dock.  I had a little plastic stand that came with an incase bag I bought, but now I use the dodocase as stand.
16338878447,Wed Jun 16 22:09:28 +0000 2010,I've learned so much about Santa Cruz since my girlfriend started writing for the sentinel. We have olive orchards! http://bit.ly/blkkUr
16253737671,Tue Jun 15 20:44:42 +0000 2010,@nfarina yes, exactly!  I hope iOS4 gets rid of the different status bar styles like iPad and just uses black all the time (or white).
16253432474,Tue Jun 15 20:39:40 +0000 2010,7AM Apple Store opening on iPhone 4 launch day?? Yikes - I woke up early for the iPad but I think I'll roll in at lunchtime for this one.
16252899268,Tue Jun 15 20:30:56 +0000 2010,The white iPhone 4 looks awkward to me.  Maybe if it had a white background for its status bar it would work better?

16186987209,Tue Jun 15 00:19:46 +0000 2010,@jeff_lamarche no, I haven't, though if it's too easy it sort of defeats the purpose of coffee snobbery ;)
16186863407,Tue Jun 15 00:17:47 +0000 2010,Got this grinder for espresso fine-grinding, but it's awesome for french press coarse-grinding too (thanks @coffeegeek) http://bit.ly/bGRycG
16186246653,Tue Jun 15 00:07:31 +0000 2010,Back to a french press after two years of lazily going drip. Now if I could only figure out the right amount of beans to grind...

16175069146,Mon Jun 14 20:45:35 +0000 2010,@stanlemon I mainly use it as a "git diff" replacement, and for that purpose it's great.
16173760049,Mon Jun 14 20:21:37 +0000 2010,Really loving the Kaleidoscope comparison app, especially the way it updates the diff immediately when I save one of the files.

16028911159,Sat Jun 12 20:47:48 +0000 2010,After a week with the Dodocase I'm still so smitten with it.  The hardcover book form factor is so perfect for iPads.

15913840029,Fri Jun 11 08:15:50 +0000 2010,@AddyR the home button I don't need to use so often.  the back button I have to use constantly and it's a real pain to reach it.
15913272235,Fri Jun 11 08:00:10 +0000 2010,Second biggest Android gripe: hard to use with one hand because my thumb can barely reach the stupid hardware buttons on the bottom.
15913220476,Fri Jun 11 07:58:48 +0000 2010,Things I like about Android: the pull-down notification bar.  Kicks iPhone's ass big time.

15816193496,Thu Jun 10 01:32:09 +0000 2010,All this talk about justified text in Safari Reader lead me to find the CSS3 spec does mention hyphenation, but says it is "up in the air".

15517135573,Sat Jun 05 23:14:59 +0000 2010,@jsamuelson that interaction is not part of the SDK, you'd have to roll your own as Reeder did (as is too often the case with iPhone SDK)
15516482135,Sat Jun 05 23:01:04 +0000 2010,@DavidKaneda No WWDC for me, but I tentatively think I can do Friday

15515930079,Sat Jun 05 22:49:11 +0000 2010,Bad feeling @reederapp is going to get rejected due to replicating the patented "pinch to expand" gesture from iPad photos app.
15464664769,Sat Jun 05 04:06:59 +0000 2010,@koedal it's constructive criticism
15448562992,Fri Jun 04 23:11:59 +0000 2010,@mdhughes UITableView is definitely the class of UIKit.
15448090126,Fri Jun 04 23:02:51 +0000 2010,@LucasTizma it's excellent.  It's a high quality app overall.

15447962007,Fri Jun 04 23:00:27 +0000 2010,@jon_adair no.  but I still use an iPhone/iPad and am disappointed in quality of apps.
15447880340,Fri Jun 04 22:58:57 +0000 2010,@lllucas Here's a priority for them: figure out how to manage a larger team that can maintain a more comprehensive toolkit.
15447647622,Fri Jun 04 22:54:22 +0000 2010,I nominate the photo viewer for "Most Developer Hours Wasted Reinventing Class That Should Be in SDK"

15447187083,Fri Jun 04 22:45:11 +0000 2010,@MaestroDMB I tried to some extent with Three20.
15447127783,Fri Jun 04 22:43:59 +0000 2010,@stroughtonsmith Yeah it's surprisingly decent.  Good enough for handwriting, at least, but perhaps frustrating for serious artwork.
15447039975,Fri Jun 04 22:42:09 +0000 2010,@SteveStreza I have, and I agree, but UIKit still has a long long way to go and it didn't advance much in OS 4.0
15446744781,Fri Jun 04 22:36:08 +0000 2010,I'd argue the App Store would have dramatically less junk if UIKit were a lot deeper and more customizable.
15446711714,Fri Jun 04 22:35:29 +0000 2010,It's amazing how many of the most import visual/interactive elements of OS X/iPhone OS are not in the SDK, forcing you to re-invent them.

15357075669,Thu Jun 03 22:52:33 +0000 2010,Must be a big debate inside Apple as to how to force devs to make HIG-compliant apps. Can't just ban them, the store would be empty.
15355833971,Thu Jun 03 22:29:21 +0000 2010,Examples: the #1 paid iPad app right now, "A1 PERFECT Web Browser", or "GoodReader", another popular app.
15355617565,Thu Jun 03 22:25:14 +0000 2010,Many of the most popular iPhone/iPad apps have that hideous Windows aesthetic, as if devs bought their first Mac just to write the app.
15354592095,Thu Jun 03 22:05:48 +0000 2010,@mhoutman dirt and oil doesn't stick to it like it does to the rubber case. It's as rugged as an actual moleskine, if you've ever had one.
15353040405,Thu Jun 03 21:35:03 +0000 2010,@glasshouseapps Fits perfectly - feels like one with the binding.  Perfect moleskine replica.

15351501721,Thu Jun 03 21:04:00 +0000 2010,@jheftmann Ordered May 3, delivered June 3.

15351250260,Thu Jun 03 20:59:06 +0000 2010,@jordan_mann I have the Apple case too and I'm not in love with it.  Will need to use Dodocase for a while before I review.
15350506136,Thu Jun 03 20:44:05 +0000 2010,@jackamick I got it the day after it shipped, but I'm only a short drive from where they shipped it from.

15277509124,Wed Jun 02 21:18:23 +0000 2010,@rentzsch I agree, but in reverse.  I assume Hollywood buys more Mac Pros than iMacs for FCP, so I would say Mac Pro is last to die.
15277106065,Wed Jun 02 21:10:15 +0000 2010,@rentzsch But don't they want consumers to go 100% to iPhone OS devices? Macs would exist only out of necessity for creatives.
15276575220,Wed Jun 02 20:59:39 +0000 2010,@rentzsch but isn't the only point of keeping Macs alive to serve the creative pro market?
15276539268,Wed Jun 02 20:58:55 +0000 2010,@oscarforest1 I'm not anti-Mac, I'm just anticipating what's likely to happen.
15276137220,Wed Jun 02 20:50:39 +0000 2010,If the Mac market is going to shrink to the size of the current market for Mac Pros, perhaps that will be the only model they keep alive?

15275151926,Wed Jun 02 20:30:29 +0000 2010,I said iPhone OS, not iPad.  I'm sure they will release larger, more powerful devices running iPhone OS in the coming years.
15275002575,Wed Jun 02 20:27:28 +0000 2010,You'll know the Mac is officially dead when Apple releases Xcode and Final Cut Pro for iPhone OS.

14864045661,Thu May 27 22:41:38 +0000 2010,On the positive side, looks like Android tools are pretty open to hacking, so you could write a new debugger if you wanted.
14863132036,Thu May 27 22:23:49 +0000 2010,Can't get Eclipse to actually compile a test app and run it in the emulator, but the TextMate Android bundle did it first try.
14862414227,Thu May 27 22:10:09 +0000 2010,@meenster oh thanks, I'll be trying that
14862120708,Thu May 27 22:04:21 +0000 2010,@lukeman diving in
14861880508,Thu May 27 21:59:48 +0000 2010,Installing Eclipse, but god help me if I don't quickly find a way to avoid having to actually use it to develop apps.
14861304909,Thu May 27 21:48:11 +0000 2010,@rabble I don't know, haven't gotten that far yet, I'm having to jump through hoops just to get the damn thing installed.
14861129782,Thu May 27 21:44:39 +0000 2010,Installing Android SDK and right off the bat it's a mess.  What's this weird "package manager" I have to slog through? Not a good start.
14859859422,Thu May 27 21:18:44 +0000 2010,Working to put my UI snobbery aside and learn to like Android.  It hurts!
14720546733,Tue May 25 22:10:52 +0000 2010,All the media saying the New Jersey Super Bowl will be in New York can just fuggedaboudit okay?
14601221260,Mon May 24 04:12:19 +0000 2010,@al3x_stone um, what? that was never said.
14601034053,Mon May 24 04:08:39 +0000 2010,@alexxr87 oh I comprehend it, I am just mad they spent tons of time on happy endings and blew off the mysteries with the lame "cork" answer.
14600986735,Mon May 24 04:07:42 +0000 2010,@al3x_stone what, that it's a "cork"??? would you have watched all 6 years if you knew it was just about a cork in a dam of light?
14600950393,Mon May 24 04:06:58 +0000 2010,@kevinmeyers a "cork" is not an answer.
14600867953,Mon May 24 04:05:20 +0000 2010,@stevebrewer not that I disliked the characters, but I was more interested in the mysteries of the island.
14600780029,Mon May 24 04:03:38 +0000 2010,@thetylerhayes of course it was!  all the island mysteries and weird events that kept happening was the theme of the show!
14600624106,Mon May 24 04:00:44 +0000 2010,Maybe I'm a cold-hearted bastard but I don't really give a shit about the characters, just wanted to know WTF the island is.
14600234847,Mon May 24 03:53:44 +0000 2010,@roboteti it ended like a lame Disney movie.  You a big Little Mermaid fan?
14599896231,Mon May 24 03:47:42 +0000 2010,Verdict: watching Lost all these years was a waste of time.  Turns out it was just a soap opera, not an intellectual sci-fi thriller.
14387322209,Thu May 20 21:51:15 +0000 2010,Sad. That was the only thing I actually wanted to hear about at Google I/O. RT @gruber What happened to Chrome OS?
14374656656,Thu May 20 17:18:30 +0000 2010,Surprised Google TV browser doesn't seem to have font size enlarged.  No way you can read standard web pages from the couch that way.
14324023581,Wed May 19 23:39:13 +0000 2010,@abood89 I just hide the bookmarks bar and use it from the new tab page.
14323999241,Wed May 19 23:38:44 +0000 2010,@natesousek I still think Chrome's aesthetic needs a lot of work, but it's overall not so bad I can't use it.
14321395795,Wed May 19 22:48:45 +0000 2010,After a few weeks using Chrome I'm really happy with it.  Don't see myself going back to Safari, much to my surprise.
13762496446,Tue May 11 02:05:11 +0000 2010,@flyosity on iPhone I agree. If it updated for iPad with split view I would use it instead of lusting for Reeder.
13762400788,Tue May 11 02:03:22 +0000 2010,@amrubin Reeder is by far the fastest to load new feeds, which is its best feature.
13762068055,Tue May 11 01:57:05 +0000 2010,Flash crashy in Android demos? C'mon, I can't demo my iPad for two minutes without apps crashing. Oh the joys of C pointers!
13761718048,Tue May 11 01:50:13 +0000 2010,Sad that NetNewswire for iPad is unusable due to taking minutes to update feeds. Great otherwise. Reeder for iPad can't get here soon enough
13531991781,Fri May 07 05:41:36 +0000 2010,Trying to train Mom on iPad to replace her Dell. Gone well, but she keeps tapping screen accidentally, closing things, and getting upset.
13499324842,Thu May 06 17:39:32 +0000 2010,@jcoronella In a VM browser, every developer can use whatever languages they want just by linking to them, not wading through a bureaucracy.
13498785042,Thu May 06 17:27:19 +0000 2010,@jdenizac what is wrong about that statement?
13497210836,Thu May 06 16:53:06 +0000 2010,Bottom line: we can currently only move as fast as employees of browser makers can go, and our imagination is limited by theirs.
13496922845,Thu May 06 16:46:51 +0000 2010,@jasonw22 see here for one possible vision http://bit.ly/aivD4O
13496863697,Thu May 06 16:45:34 +0000 2010,@lucidbeing nothing.
13495746278,Thu May 06 16:21:46 +0000 2010,@jasonw22 yes
13495173232,Thu May 06 16:09:45 +0000 2010,@gregferrell the same way javascript is prevented from being virus heaven - sandboxing.
13495145953,Thu May 06 16:09:10 +0000 2010,@barker_ja No. I want all browsers to be able to run the same portable byte code and defer to downloadable libraries to render the page.
13494995277,Thu May 06 16:05:55 +0000 2010,We will move even faster if we can bust up the W3C monopoly on web tech and just make the browser a VM that can run any language/framework.
13494987224,Thu May 06 16:05:46 +0000 2010,Yes, the web has moved forward greatly in the last 2 years, in no small part thanks to Google.
13389480023,Tue May 04 23:00:59 +0000 2010,Yes, I know, my website is down.  Dreamhost server failed, killed my Django db, and I'm just going to migrate to posterous when I have time.
13388164737,Tue May 04 22:31:38 +0000 2010,@luxorules Kind of upset lately about having to choose between beautiful/closed and ugly/open.
13387373307,Tue May 04 22:14:13 +0000 2010,Not that I am a great designer myself.  I surely am not,  I just love what I do more when I get to work with great designers.

13386399857,Tue May 04 21:52:32 +0000 2010,When Apple uses one-line borders they blend with the 3D lighting, but Google's lines just look like the first pass in an unfinished mockup.
13386022876,Tue May 04 21:44:00 +0000 2010,@SteveStreza Oh I never click on it, but I still have to look at it when I'm scanning my tabs.
13385993106,Tue May 04 21:43:19 +0000 2010,@hypernado Yeah, no.  The high contrast lines and the UFO-inspired shape just don't fit on Mac OS X.
13385937632,Tue May 04 21:42:03 +0000 2010,@nikhilk I'm very impressed by it and I'm hoping it is as nice to use as it looks.
13385873276,Tue May 04 21:40:37 +0000 2010,http://yfrog.com/0e7kop  One of the reasons I dropped Chrome last time is I can't stand looking at this ugly thing all day.
13385062432,Tue May 04 21:21:35 +0000 2010,It's not that Google designs are ugly, just uninspiring. Apple reflects a passion for beauty which inspires, even if they miss the mark.
13385047573,Tue May 04 21:21:14 +0000 2010,I avoid Google products (other than search and maps) because their utilitarian styling depresses my motivation to make beautiful things.
13384836125,Tue May 04 21:16:25 +0000 2010,@BrantTedeschi Felt a little slow and unstable - understandable for a first beta.
13384298131,Tue May 04 21:04:14 +0000 2010,RT @chockenberry: IPHONE DEV ALERT: Don't install Beta 3 if you use a custom install like /DeveloperBeta https://devforums.apple.com/thr ...

13383078709,Tue May 04 20:36:34 +0000 2010,@anotherlab I sure am.  It's great.
13382711515,Tue May 04 20:28:09 +0000 2010,@pothibo I felt that Safari was faster when the Chrome/Mac beta first came out, but now I'm not so sure.
