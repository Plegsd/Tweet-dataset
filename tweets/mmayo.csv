11342394577,Wed Mar 31 02:17:05 +0000 2010,@aconbere yeah, that's what we've been doing. see @ryah's node.js implementation as evidence of us ignoring lots of amqp.  :)
11339705770,Wed Mar 31 01:15:34 +0000 2010,I will not disagree, however, that AMQP is "too much, most of the time". Is 0MQ a "worse is better" candidate? I have no idea yet.
11338879636,Wed Mar 31 00:59:17 +0000 2010,I chose AMQP for a bunch of Joyent projects because of RabbitMQ more than anything. I don't have an educated opinion of 0MQ yet.
