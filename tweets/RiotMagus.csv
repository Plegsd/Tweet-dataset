423671174640308200,Thu Jan 16 04:20:54 +0000 2014,@Richard_A_Lewis 100% agreed.  He'd be great on show like Around the Horn where the host can force mute, haha.
423671095737069600,Thu Jan 16 04:20:35 +0000 2014,@EsportWIRE I wish Julian could cast starting Week 1 but we have to make sure he can work in NA legally!
423670389739253760,Thu Jan 16 04:17:46 +0000 2014,@EsportWIRE We did caster exchange last year and felt it was a positive experience for fans and good for casters. We'll likely do it again.
423669820425375740,Thu Jan 16 04:15:31 +0000 2014,@Richard_A_Lewis While he can be entertaining/edgey, I respectfully think he often goes too far to the point of disruption (ex: SotL today)
423668476671037440,Thu Jan 16 04:10:10 +0000 2014,@Richard_A_Lewis Lastly, it's hard to say "edge is great" when edge = geared towards hardcore. There are fewer of those than people think.
423668164279275500,Thu Jan 16 04:08:56 +0000 2014,@Richard_A_Lewis We're still trying to figure out the best way to enable people to have that edge while actually delivering quality.
423667998784622600,Thu Jan 16 04:08:16 +0000 2014,@Richard_A_Lewis Thanks for the feedback. Balancing edge vs. not-being-overly-dramatic is tough. I think most people fail at it.

395394235546882050,Wed Oct 30 03:38:26 +0000 2013,@OptimusTom FF7 hugely overrated! Although Golden saucer was bomb. Sephiroth was just a terribly one-dimensional villain... #kefka4life

393949301639872500,Sat Oct 26 03:56:47 +0000 2013,@hitstreak I only like trash talking outside of the game at the pro level. It's just too direct and painful to convey during a game.
