699090862752403500,Mon Feb 15 04:40:24 +0000 2016,20/ That's over. And not a minute too soon
699090798365683700,Mon Feb 15 04:40:09 +0000 2016,19/ An easy funding environment with high valuations can give false signals on capital efficiency by meeting the rule sans biz progress
699090669302784000,Mon Feb 15 04:39:38 +0000 2016,18/ Therefore forces Founders to align burn with stage of business until the business grows enough in value
699090552126464000,Mon Feb 15 04:39:10 +0000 2016,17/ This thumb rule minimizes Founder dilution; increases investor returns - implies core biz building till it achieves such value
699090112856985600,Mon Feb 15 04:37:26 +0000 2016,16/ Important that Founders focus on capital efficiency and raise money only when their companies are worth 10-25x of capital raised
699090066421841900,Mon Feb 15 04:37:14 +0000 2016,15/ The above numbers are indicative than exact science - the round sizes above are what they should be; not what they have been recently
699089885559304200,Mon Feb 15 04:36:31 +0000 2016,14/ Companies need to come out of the cash trough (reducing peak burn) and should be non-Marketing breakeven before they raise next round
699089795604045800,Mon Feb 15 04:36:10 +0000 2016,13/ This stage is where things are craziest and unsustainable right now. Burn &gt; net revenue = impending disaster
699089741354905600,Mon Feb 15 04:35:57 +0000 2016,12/ Series C - to demonstrate scalable and sustainable business model - peak burn no more than 1M$/mo so ~15-20M$ Series gives ~18-24 mos.
699089695230136300,Mon Feb 15 04:35:46 +0000 2016,11/ Series B - to multiply traction and iterate business model - further double peak burn to ~1.5-2cr/mo so ~6-8M$ Series B gives ~18-24 mos
699089644298727400,Mon Feb 15 04:35:34 +0000 2016,10/ Series A - to scale early PMF and build traction - one may double peak burn to ~70L/mo so ~2-3M$ Series A gives ~18-24 mos.
699089611436363800,Mon Feb 15 04:35:26 +0000 2016,9/ Seed stage - prior to clear PMF - keep peak burn to ~30L/mo at most so ~3-4cr seed gives ~18 mos. for MVP and some iterative early PMF
699089554486095900,Mon Feb 15 04:35:12 +0000 2016,8/ While no exact science - sharing some high level views on appropriate burn rates during business building by stage of Co.
699089507547635700,Mon Feb 15 04:35:01 +0000 2016,7/ So companies should focus on building businesses the right way and take an axe to burn rates
699089456968564700,Mon Feb 15 04:34:49 +0000 2016,6/ Admittedly the strategic investors leading these rounds now are here to stay - but even their shareholders will ask questions
699089414190829600,Mon Feb 15 04:34:39 +0000 2016,5/ Companies raising 50, 100 million dollar rounds is not going to come back anytime soon; as poor capital intensity kills returns
699089172296929300,Mon Feb 15 04:33:41 +0000 2016,4/ If one looks back in history, current environment is not an exception - the preceding 12-18 heady months were

642287558395736000,Fri Sep 11 10:44:21 +0000 2015,14/ Bottomline is that getting the mix of experienced and inexperienced talent right is very tough but very rewarding so worth the effort
642287436521828400,Fri Sep 11 10:43:52 +0000 2015,13/ Operations, Customer Delight etc. need a mix of both. And Founder anyway has to be able to manage it all! üòä
642287382385946600,Fri Sep 11 10:43:39 +0000 2015,12/¬†‚ÄúLine‚Äù¬†skills like Business Units, Business Development, Product Management etc. maybe from blue sky thinking so younger can work well.
642287286462189600,Fri Sep 11 10:43:16 +0000 2015,11/ My bias is that "known" skills like Technology, Finance, HR, Marketing and Sales benefit more from experienced hires.
642287199266799600,Fri Sep 11 10:42:56 +0000 2015,10/ A direct report "span of control" of 8-10 with almost an equal mix of both - I think it's a recipe for supernormal success.

642286958429925400,Fri Sep 11 10:41:58 +0000 2015,8/ One should hire rock star experienced talent - but¬†the¬†‚Äúentrepreneurs at heart and in action‚Äù¬†variety; some just don‚Äôt get opportunities.
642286857254867000,Fri Sep 11 10:41:34 +0000 2015,7/ Also counter-examples of experienced hires and no value creation!¬†Our limited experience is that there is actually a best of both worlds.
642286748941185000,Fri Sep 11 10:41:08 +0000 2015,6/ Yet, Globally, Facebook had Sheryl Sandberg. Google had Eric Schmidt. Apple and LinkedIn inflected when founders returned with experience
642286611175096300,Fri Sep 11 10:40:35 +0000 2015,5/ When you are trying to change the World and innovate, is experience a liability by definition? Some version of this resonates with me.
642286532125024300,Fri Sep 11 10:40:17 +0000 2015,4/ The struggle is¬†‚Äúthe right thing‚Äù! Is it a Company of young go getters exclusively or does experience matter?!
642286454270378000,Fri Sep 11 10:39:58 +0000 2015,3/ And they want to do the right thing for Company building. So no debate there.
