804542981437083600,Fri Dec 02 04:29:29 +0000 2016,@stevenhorner6 it doesn't change peoples opinions of him, but of the world we live in.

804542180694118400,Fri Dec 02 04:26:18 +0000 2016,@TayGreenMusic yes sir. I know. My question is. Why would someone or some society depict a falsehood?

804540214626701300,Fri Dec 02 04:18:29 +0000 2016,@stevenhorner6 thinking about the way society brainwashes us into thinking what they want us to think about certain situations.
804539991070220300,Fri Dec 02 04:17:36 +0000 2016,@TayGreenMusic we're told that "God is white". Theologians know, but do all Christians.
804539573737062400,Fri Dec 02 04:15:56 +0000 2016,@TayGreenMusic I understand completely. As an African-American I have to wonder the toll it had on my ancestors that couldn't read but

804536983255208000,Fri Dec 02 04:05:39 +0000 2016,@burr_curtis if you're not a Christian then it probably doesn't matter to you and that's understandable.
804536732184117200,Fri Dec 02 04:04:39 +0000 2016,@burr_curtis as a Christian I take the Bible as truth. I don't know your beliefs. In the Bible it clearly states what he looks like.
804536530513563600,Fri Dec 02 04:03:51 +0000 2016,@TayGreenMusic of course no question. But I really would like to know why people would depict him like this? Just a simple question.
804536204934910000,Fri Dec 02 04:02:33 +0000 2016,@kings_fanatic why lie about someone who is your savior?
804536092858916900,Fri Dec 02 04:02:06 +0000 2016,@kings_fanatic I'm asking. Why?
804536024428937200,Fri Dec 02 04:01:50 +0000 2016,@kings_fanatic the Bible states clearly what he looks like.
804534786371047400,Fri Dec 02 03:56:55 +0000 2016,As a Christian I am ashamed of the way my savior Jesus Christ is depicted when it clearly states in the Bible what he looks like.

732416111296143400,Tue May 17 03:43:03 +0000 2016,Hellava win for OKC. For Russ to bounce back in the second half like he did, after the way he shot in first half was crazy.
