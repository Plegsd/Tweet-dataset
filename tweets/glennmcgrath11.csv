356051810080927740,Sat Jul 13 14:05:41 +0000 2013,I'm saying they need to decide on something clear cut for DRS. Not it's out this time but not out next time and the balls hitting both times
356049029441916900,Sat Jul 13 13:54:38 +0000 2013,DRS rule re LBW needs to be changed. To much grey area. It should more than 50% of the ball hitting leg stump then out less than 50% not out
