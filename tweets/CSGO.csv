190992009362804740,Sat Apr 14 02:36:58 +0000 2012,@Sniper257 Yep, a bug cropped up in our transition from testing to steam.  Looking at it.
190939463579467780,Fri Apr 13 23:08:10 +0000 2012,Keys have gone out for today - good luck.
190901230153908220,Fri Apr 13 20:36:14 +0000 2012,New update is out http://t.co/5wdknXZK Keys will come later.
190244551540211700,Thu Apr 12 01:06:50 +0000 2012,@revampedb Plenty of changes - including one that will shake you!
190244373034831870,Thu Apr 12 01:06:07 +0000 2012,@Mike_The_Maggot That work will come... but really?  You prefer the pad over mouse and keyboard?
190225360598732800,Wed Apr 11 23:50:34 +0000 2012,@xnailerx How are you trying to connect?
190225266784735230,Wed Apr 11 23:50:12 +0000 2012,Adding 3rd party servers and testing the server browser.
190094634733674500,Wed Apr 11 15:11:07 +0000 2012,Looking forward to HeatoN's CSGO return. http://t.co/ONRXozwh
189500626932211700,Mon Apr 09 23:50:44 +0000 2012,@kin2k1 You should start seeing some more servers this week.
189082136811286530,Sun Apr 08 20:07:49 +0000 2012,@Ankurre no region is being ignored.
188322248308957200,Fri Apr 06 17:48:17 +0000 2012,@deek_ we will do keys from us and to community sites next week.
188322122324639740,Fri Apr 06 17:47:47 +0000 2012,@iGAtrax this is a bit of a holiday weekend so next week.
188316717670346750,Fri Apr 06 17:26:18 +0000 2012,@iGAtrax maybe not. Much of the team is out of the office today.
188097318942281730,Fri Apr 06 02:54:30 +0000 2012,@BrinkerSC summerish.

187755807083995140,Thu Apr 05 04:17:27 +0000 2012,@SalLau nope. Scam.
187468410643423230,Wed Apr 04 09:15:26 +0000 2012,@xDownpour it will have private matches. Can we put this rumor to rest already?
187468017083494400,Wed Apr 04 09:13:52 +0000 2012,@blinkmeplz we have talked about it. In an early poll that was the #1 mod request.  Not at launch but maybe later.
187280387830059000,Tue Apr 03 20:48:18 +0000 2012,@Mu6o not sure how you can pre-order something that has no price or release date.
187279925068316670,Tue Apr 03 20:46:28 +0000 2012,@JaxeZero we will go into more detail. Now that we have the data we are modeling some scenarios to see what works best.
186909501201448960,Mon Apr 02 20:14:32 +0000 2012,@Wintastik every week we will fix some and probably add some. This is one of the rough spots of a real beta: an active churning code base
185900172658737150,Sat Mar 31 01:23:49 +0000 2012,@Spart029 working on it.
185807338593206270,Fri Mar 30 19:14:56 +0000 2012,@Pandabj0rnen if we did it by years played only - you would be around 5 millionth on the list.

185565324660318200,Fri Mar 30 03:13:15 +0000 2012,@PGApexjE early update.
185266395779571700,Thu Mar 29 07:25:25 +0000 2012,@lurppis_ check your direct msgs. I sent you a follow-up.
185154428066738180,Thu Mar 29 00:00:30 +0000 2012,@rconectnet we are working on this. Right now it is limited until we get some bugs worked out.
185137530650378240,Wed Mar 28 22:53:21 +0000 2012,@ninjowned yep. Working to get more severs in more areas.
185086230533373950,Wed Mar 28 19:29:30 +0000 2012,@Sp8ky yes they will be available and all working correctly thanks to the beta players.
185085698221686800,Wed Mar 28 19:27:23 +0000 2012,@PolarBro we have been doing them on Friday. Does that work keeping it consistent?
185085419359191040,Wed Mar 28 19:26:17 +0000 2012,@onlyL0RD yep. Thanks for the clip. The bots/nav need some work. To be fair they are blindfolded ;)
185083986190675970,Wed Mar 28 19:20:35 +0000 2012,@kiler280 we will do another call out for sites in a few weeks.  That's how we got the first round.
185069818842578940,Wed Mar 28 18:24:17 +0000 2012,@lurppis_ @revampedb are you in the current private pro-forum for cs:go?
184449644170985470,Tue Mar 27 01:19:56 +0000 2012,@rammi404 I know of one way we can test that theory...
184435954306650100,Tue Mar 27 00:25:32 +0000 2012,@revampedb Why in the world do you think that?  Simply not true.
184101980426338300,Mon Mar 26 02:18:27 +0000 2012,@RobB1337 You have to wait until you are selected.  The beta is not ready for an open call yet. thanks
184101869646393340,Mon Mar 26 02:18:00 +0000 2012,@DoctaWorm A better chance than if you didn't...  selections are not always based on when you filled it out.

183660944352743420,Sat Mar 24 21:05:56 +0000 2012,@LeRaldo @CPalmer82 Not to say we are done tweaking but one step is 3rd party servers playing with values.Server hosts have their own beta.
183660519440384000,Sat Mar 24 21:04:14 +0000 2012,@Verdu_CSS Nice work.
183655827465453570,Sat Mar 24 20:45:36 +0000 2012,@LeRaldo @CPalmer82 Past evidence doesn't prove that, most servers are run with some mod/changes.
183655609374216200,Sat Mar 24 20:44:44 +0000 2012,@CPalmer82 As mentioned in the blog, once the servers get rolled out we can see what settings get changed and what people prefer.
183653292331638800,Sat Mar 24 20:35:31 +0000 2012,@CPalmer82 server operators will have options there for what they want to do.   Right now we are looking at default settings.
183652992166281200,Sat Mar 24 20:34:20 +0000 2012,@TheRealMygaming This is what our 3rd party server testers are helping us with.  We want to make some perf improvements before we say.
183652739086155780,Sat Mar 24 20:33:19 +0000 2012,@lizana5195 Asking here or mailing us will not get you a key. Just fill out the survey and hold tight.
183652611763875840,Sat Mar 24 20:32:49 +0000 2012,@MarcinMater We still need to limit the size of the beta at this point.

183272447431294980,Fri Mar 23 19:22:11 +0000 2012,@blinkmeplz CS:GO will be the best version of CS on the respective platforms.  So best PC version, best 360 version, best PS3 version etc.

182624473076338700,Thu Mar 22 00:27:22 +0000 2012,@J1M0 Eventually yes.
182613593404096500,Wed Mar 21 23:44:08 +0000 2012,@CSbeatsRamen Do you have example locations where this is happening?
182519266594127870,Wed Mar 21 17:29:18 +0000 2012,@Lite_Brite_Iggy We saw this.  Working on it. It will get fixed, not sure what update.
182359652716122100,Wed Mar 21 06:55:03 +0000 2012,@CPalmer82 Source by default is based on a larger model.  All of the maps, models, props, everything would need to change.
182358865998917630,Wed Mar 21 06:51:56 +0000 2012,@Muffinabus During the beta performance will continually get better and then go bad then better. It is part of an active code base.
182352406577819650,Wed Mar 21 06:26:16 +0000 2012,@Boothy But then we would have to add punching! I think the knife is too much a hallmark of CS to remove it.
182351607969755140,Wed Mar 21 06:23:05 +0000 2012,@CPalmer82 That is the question.The hitboxes are obviously just one part of it along with accuracy etc.Adjust them all for the right feel.

181966971410202620,Tue Mar 20 04:54:41 +0000 2012,@JamieSkella @sileZnThe symptom is player's are not getting feedback on recoil. It's best to start with the problem and then find a solution
181963314493001730,Tue Mar 20 04:40:09 +0000 2012,@JamieSkella @sileZn To be clear. We look at everything. And try and evaluate most. That doesn't mean everything gets into the game.
181962090016292860,Tue Mar 20 04:35:17 +0000 2012,@pr1cetag0 People like this did not get that many keys from us.  They traded for them.

181177163247124480,Sun Mar 18 00:36:16 +0000 2012,@Nate3930K this is exactly what we wanted to do but a bug popped up so we delayed it. Without it the voting is then a bit broken.
181144958022074370,Sat Mar 17 22:28:18 +0000 2012,@kAppelkvist @erichasinternet you mean total system crash? It depends. Not many being seen. Does it happen every time?
181144661665132540,Sat Mar 17 22:27:07 +0000 2012,@iamitajen during this stage of the beta we only have US servers on the coasts. So again this is why we aren't ready to grow the beta 2 fast

181134908910084100,Sat Mar 17 21:48:22 +0000 2012,@MrRonando this is what we call a regression. A bug we fix that comes back. They are my least favorite bug... Thanks.
181134630659960830,Sat Mar 17 21:47:15 +0000 2012,@erichasinternet when you crash that sends data to us so we can analyze the issue.  We have started at the most frequent and work down.
181134261506670600,Sat Mar 17 21:45:47 +0000 2012,@kAppelkvist awesome. Thanks for giving it a fair shake.
181134137623707650,Sat Mar 17 21:45:18 +0000 2012,@Mitchellscheetz correct. Friends keys only go with certain pulls from the survey where we choose the account.

181090224724647940,Sat Mar 17 18:50:48 +0000 2012,@iamitajen because it is a beta?  That's why we just don't let everyone in. Need to get better server coverage.
181089995904397300,Sat Mar 17 18:49:54 +0000 2012,@iano200 with the recent keys all players also got one. Friend lying to you?

181051257711104000,Sat Mar 17 16:15:58 +0000 2012,@i_gordeev No it's not true. Every country seems to think this and it simply isn't true.

180880277323780100,Sat Mar 17 04:56:33 +0000 2012,@Kazuela07 sorry but that isn't in yet. We know it is an important feature.
180843710311964670,Sat Mar 17 02:31:15 +0000 2012,@chaddy_badger Arsenal mode is the original name of the mode.  The GG guys were good with our name choice as a nod to the roots of the mod.
180840853080772600,Sat Mar 17 02:19:53 +0000 2012,@lfc_7 @Arandomu That was an estimate to that point.  25+ million people have played CS.  We aren't ready to give them all a key yet.
180840515049230340,Sat Mar 17 02:18:33 +0000 2012,@sharkh20ster @TheHarrisShow To be fair that is a common point.we just want to put it into perspective of why that is not the best criteria.
180840055974264830,Sat Mar 17 02:16:43 +0000 2012,@chopstixZ_ Yes. SO BE NICE!
180839757385965570,Sat Mar 17 02:15:32 +0000 2012,@ko1ayo We currently are taking across all slices of data and when entered.  That gives everyone a fair chance.

179993538623311870,Wed Mar 14 18:12:58 +0000 2012,@weenus That is a pretty bad outlook considering we keep changing gameplay, feel, layout, looks, etc.

173998048651911170,Mon Feb 27 05:09:02 +0000 2012,@More_Js We can't add that to the fact page yet - because all of you haven't given your input on the game yet.
173997862470959100,Mon Feb 27 05:08:17 +0000 2012,@VampireCss CS has crazy play times.   600 hours in CSS makes you still a bit on the newb side of the equation - crazy.

173996403935285250,Mon Feb 27 05:02:30 +0000 2012,@RoccoCostello That is a bug... that is not really a fact question and should be fixed pretty soon.
173996099122630660,Mon Feb 27 05:01:17 +0000 2012,@Draklor_ Hell no.  This is Counter-strike.
173995600235343870,Mon Feb 27 04:59:18 +0000 2012,With the beta going strong,time to update the FACTS page.  Besides - how do I get a beta key - what questions do you have?

173221138640539650,Sat Feb 25 01:41:52 +0000 2012,@Redd1ng Australians should just be matching to them automatically.  If you aren't let us know and we can investigate.

170932897354747900,Sat Feb 18 18:09:13 +0000 2012,@banGert333 yes.  One reason to make CS:GO was so we had a game we could keep updating without breaking what players were accustomed to.

169921943183695870,Wed Feb 15 23:12:02 +0000 2012,@manbearcolt We currently have to keep the numbers smaller. Even with pre-orders we would have to limit the number of people. Same problem.

152560432618545150,Fri Dec 30 01:23:36 +0000 2011,Another stat,there is one kill for every 24 shots fired from the AK.The M4 is 29 shots to 1 kill.The leader is the AWP with 1 in 3. #CSGO
152559600497999870,Fri Dec 30 01:20:17 +0000 2011,You guys figured it out.  The AK is the #1 shot weapon with 42% of all rounds coming from it, the M4 is next with 36% of shots fired. #CSGO
152293640079802370,Thu Dec 29 07:43:27 +0000 2011,For CS:GO we track every single bullet shot.  Any guesses on the most fired weapon?
149270823335759870,Tue Dec 20 23:31:52 +0000 2011,@missharvey There are many things that can influence localized results and we are tracking everything so we will continue to break out stats
149270049818026000,Tue Dec 20 23:28:47 +0000 2011,@rhysmorgan You can never achieve perfect 50/50 but getting it to hover around 50% is important.  We want to make sure maps stay viable.
149269285586468860,Tue Dec 20 23:25:45 +0000 2011,It will be fun to watch this number over time as more weapons are added, player skill becomes wider, and new strategies are created.  #CSGO
149269042371366900,Tue Dec 20 23:24:47 +0000 2011,49% of the time CTs win.This matches our internal testing.It is important that we track data so we can measure changes. #CSGO
