590549639054647300,Tue Apr 21 16:16:20 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer if ur argument is true, then everyone-gov, drs &amp; everyone working for pharma has to be inherently evil &amp; wish harm to children.

590548498866659300,Tue Apr 21 16:11:48 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer for the health of my kids I  researched BOTH sides for 3 weeks &amp; came out w/peer reviewed medical studies that proved vac safety.
590547910942658600,Tue Apr 21 16:09:28 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer I shared factual information. it's terrifying to lead with fear and emotion instead of evidence.
590547509304496100,Tue Apr 21 16:07:52 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer disagree completly. Ppl cam only choose 4 themselves when they have gathered factual information upon which to make thier choice.
590533266123403300,Tue Apr 21 15:11:16 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer couldn't agree more. And I respect all decisions but do have strong opinions of my own based on evidence I've seen-just as u do.
590532797212844000,Tue Apr 21 15:09:25 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer agreed but that's not the argument u made in ur first tweet. U said I was choosing for others. Which is not correct.
590527915370143700,Tue Apr 21 14:50:01 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer that's called sharing, not making decisions for others.
590527904020303900,Tue Apr 21 14:49:58 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer Noone should listen to anyone but the FACTS. The proven, medical facts. Free of opinion, free of money influences, free of fear.
590526624849911800,Tue Apr 21 14:44:53 +0000 2015,@ann_hauer sad u interpret an op-ed as "making decisions for others". I chose to write abt MY journey &amp; what I learned. 2 very diff things.
