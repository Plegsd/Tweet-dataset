658009544107278300,Sat Oct 24 19:57:55 +0000 2015,So copy, experiment, destroy, or whatever makes your art flourish in a world that needs billions of unique voices to inspire each other.
658008286684278800,Sat Oct 24 19:52:55 +0000 2015,Each of our individual experiences will never be the same and thus our artistic voices are all unique.

658007849520402400,Sat Oct 24 19:51:11 +0000 2015,You can appreciate art for what it is to you. Where it came from is another layer entirely.
658007738962718700,Sat Oct 24 19:50:44 +0000 2015,Surely I've been inspired, consciously or subconsciously, by other artists or moments in life, and that's infused in my art.
658007590182387700,Sat Oct 24 19:50:09 +0000 2015,Emulation truly is the sincerest form of flattery. And more importantly, it's an incredible way to learn.

499735003882745860,Thu Aug 14 01:51:24 +0000 2014,Today's conversation was not in defense of critique. Critique is healthy and should be welcome. Please be supportive even of alternate views
