911274474024161300,Fri Sep 22 17:02:19 +0000 2017,What is weird is he didn't list exact earnings. (Based on his prior salary brags, Cobb may be on lower end of range) https://t.co/AwMv3N7jmO
911272660813992000,Fri Sep 22 16:55:07 +0000 2017,To clarify: Cobb's note about his capital isn't too unusual. Partners may borrow from the bank to front capital that a firm requires.

910307716807217200,Wed Sep 20 01:00:47 +0000 2017,Bottom line: Trump either isn't using private lawyers for wall-to-wall do-not-sleep crisis defense. Or  somebody else is paying other bills
910307006996762600,Wed Sep 20 00:57:57 +0000 2017,That's maybe half of each of these lawyers' month of August. Maybe not even that much, depending on what they're charging Trump.
910306608823115800,Wed Sep 20 00:56:22 +0000 2017,Sekulow, for hypothetically 130 hours. Dowd for maybe 100 hours. (We won't see lawyers they leverage to in filing-those are subcontractors)
910306111768682500,Wed Sep 20 00:54:24 +0000 2017,Back to the RNC figures. $230,000. That buys a typical, modest crisis/white collar defense attorney for ~230 hours.
910305431691649000,Wed Sep 20 00:51:42 +0000 2017,All this said, even baby lawyers don't come cheap. In DC, the bargain firms may bill them at $450 an hour.
910305155832336400,Wed Sep 20 00:50:36 +0000 2017,I have no idea if the Trump team is leveraging work down--Kasowitz surely was (is?), since the whole firm had (has?) the client.

908518154002890800,Fri Sep 15 02:29:42 +0000 2017,Months later, the nice lady who ran the Arts Center felt so sorry for us all that she mailed us each checks. Mine was for $7.
908517626502099000,Fri Sep 15 02:27:36 +0000 2017,Neither did the writer/director, and he was supposed to play the guy with the newspaper! But the show must go on. And it did.
908517200151109600,Fri Sep 15 02:25:54 +0000 2017,Opening night: Stuck performing in that church from the audition. Sold ~30 tickets. Theater critic from the Pgh Post-Gazette never showed
908516674982367200,Fri Sep 15 02:23:49 +0000 2017,But by god, did the cast stick with it. Some wanted the money, some just loved the idea of being in a play.
908516379271278600,Fri Sep 15 02:22:38 +0000 2017,This play was set in 1889 pre-flood. That was conveyed through some dowdy dresses, costume top hats, maybe a line about "the dam" and "rain"
908515431140532200,Fri Sep 15 02:18:52 +0000 2017,And: The play's tension is to come from the idea that all of the characters in the play will be killed in the Johnstown Flood.
908515064063381500,Fri Sep 15 02:17:25 +0000 2017,One of the older guys in the play at one point asked the writer/director why the play had no conflict. The answer? "It's a slice of life."
908514671518511100,Fri Sep 15 02:15:51 +0000 2017,Another scene was the entire cast in baseball uniforms dancing around the stage. That was the "dream ballet" sequence
908514383705321500,Fri Sep 15 02:14:43 +0000 2017,One scene(my big debut) was just people on stage pretending to prune flowers to decorate, and to hang flag bunting for a Memorial Day Parade
908513930020032500,Fri Sep 15 02:12:54 +0000 2017,One scene had her trying on her wedding dress. One scene had him talking to a man reading a newspaper about what it's like to be married.
908513766895169500,Fri Sep 15 02:12:16 +0000 2017,The play was about a woman (Daisy?) and her fiancé and her best friend. They were preparing for her wedding. All very happy.
908513404238876700,Fri Sep 15 02:10:49 +0000 2017,And the plot of what he had on paper curiously had no conflict. None, zilch.
908513168934293500,Fri Sep 15 02:09:53 +0000 2017,He handed us photocopied pages of the script, and the last few scenes were missing. He was still "working on them"
908512958833152000,Fri Sep 15 02:09:03 +0000 2017,On 1st day of rehearsal, we showed up at the Arts Center thinking we'd head to a real theater. The director led us to a back storage room.
908512490786566100,Fri Sep 15 02:07:11 +0000 2017,Little did I know that some of the juniors/seniors in my high school and even real adult pro actors gave up their summers to take roles too.
908511967761109000,Fri Sep 15 02:05:07 +0000 2017,I got cast as Flower Girl 1. Or something like that. OF COURSE I was all in.
908511730543874000,Fri Sep 15 02:04:10 +0000 2017,Our hometown would rebuild the shuttered steel mills and welcome theater festivals years in the future, because of this play we originated
908511352603512800,Fri Sep 15 02:02:40 +0000 2017,...that we'd win AWARDS, have HUGE audiences, take it on the road and GET PAID $100-$1000 stipends, depending on the role we landed
908510887497093100,Fri Sep 15 02:00:49 +0000 2017,The director told us he was founding a significant cultural experience for all of Johnstown, that the play would be BIG, an ANNUAL event ...
908510330510364700,Fri Sep 15 01:58:36 +0000 2017,My mom drove me to the church where they held the audition and sat in a pew while I read some scene about people buying...flags and flowers.
908509932319858700,Fri Sep 15 01:57:01 +0000 2017,Of course 14-year-old me saw this as THE shot at stardom. So I auditioned for this director/playwright when the Arts Center put out the call
908509329195663400,Fri Sep 15 01:54:38 +0000 2017,And its playwright was a big-time theater director from nearby Pittsburgh. Oh boy, was that Big City.
908508985224986600,Fri Sep 15 01:53:16 +0000 2017,The play was called "Flags And Flowers." It was about the great Johnstown Flood of 1889, one of the most horrific disasters in U.S. history.
908508558123307000,Fri Sep 15 01:51:34 +0000 2017,The neighborhood Arts Center, a historic building known for its antique doll collection, announced it would produce an original play

897960386925932500,Wed Aug 16 23:16:54 +0000 2017,What will the major law firms who still work for Trump (Jones Day, Morgan Lewis, Kasowitz, King &amp; Spalding, Hughes Hubbard) say and do?
897959598052712400,Wed Aug 16 23:13:46 +0000 2017,So now the questions are: How will these firm pledges materialize in legal work, court challenges, lobbying?

897958331666411500,Wed Aug 16 23:08:44 +0000 2017,For instance, when Trump issued the travel ban and thousands of their lawyers rushed to airports, few law firms took stances
897957860629401600,Wed Aug 16 23:06:51 +0000 2017,That's pretty stunning too. It's not often you see an entire firm get behind a cause.

895118927210188800,Wed Aug 09 03:05:57 +0000 2017,And in the context of all lawyers who took Trump-era federal jobs, Mueller group was some of the biggest earners in DC private practice
895117977724616700,Wed Aug 09 03:02:11 +0000 2017,So at Wilmer, Mueller and his investigation teammates came in well above avg 2016 pay per partner(profits per partner). They were prized
895117504326008800,Wed Aug 09 03:00:18 +0000 2017,In legal industy reporting, we figure out average pay for law firm partners by dividing net profit into a "profits per partner" (PPP) figure
895117118978621400,Wed Aug 09 02:58:46 +0000 2017,Looks like salaries to the outside world. But they're actually profits, since law firm partners are partial biz owners, not employees.
895116814908358700,Wed Aug 09 02:57:33 +0000 2017,For purposes of the Post story + my explanation, what equity partners at law firms (like the Mueller team folks from Wilmer) make ...
895116108906336300,Wed Aug 09 02:54:45 +0000 2017,This story explains how Wilmer sought to pay partners more than DC competitors, yet how competition is still fierce https://t.co/UeK3VZxUaX
895115536870367200,Wed Aug 09 02:52:29 +0000 2017,Rates also show how hard Wilmer is trying to compete with out of town law firms, including the NYC and Chicago firms that pay multimillions
895114919112257500,Wed Aug 09 02:50:01 +0000 2017,Quarles at $5M+ is eye-opening. Wilmer clearly cared about Quarles' contributions over decades. He was former Hale and Dorr managing partner
895113370499723300,Wed Aug 09 02:43:52 +0000 2017,As for the other Wilmer lawyers' pay, Rhee, Zebley have great resumes, were rising white collar stars. Makes sense they'd be around firm PPP
895113123467808800,Wed Aug 09 02:42:53 +0000 2017,Though we don't know how his contract was set up. Maybe he had clauses dictating how long he needed to stay at Wilmer, how much client work
895112776913440800,Wed Aug 09 02:41:31 +0000 2017,Of course Mueller, a big catch when the firm hired him, would get almost double. Almost surprised the firm didn't give him more, $5-7M, say
895111401219530800,Wed Aug 09 02:36:03 +0000 2017,Reminder that Wilmer Hale's firmwide average pay (aka profits) per partner was $1.9 million last year
895110216970358800,Wed Aug 09 02:31:20 +0000 2017,Makes sense Mueller made $3M+ at Wilmer Hale. I didn't expect the firm to have Jim Quarles' salary so much higher https://t.co/fGdln3UPiU
