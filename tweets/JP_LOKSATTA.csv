811599658778652700,Wed Dec 21 15:50:12 +0000 2016,In a cycle of 5 yrs, ₹100,000cr is spent in LS, LA &amp; local polls. Abt ten times is collected to sustain this. This vicious cycle must end.
811598655048122400,Wed Dec 21 15:46:12 +0000 2016,Most MPs spend ₹30-50cr to get elected. Illegitimate spend, vote buying &amp; black money r integral to our politics. We need reform, not drama.
811597936429666300,Wed Dec 21 15:43:21 +0000 2016,I opposed Lokpal's jurisdiction over PM &amp; report of 2nd ARC reflects my reasoning. Modi or MMS or any PM shd be accountable only to LS.
811597224861782000,Wed Dec 21 15:40:31 +0000 2016,Politics apart, no PM shd be subjected to casual allegations. Enquiry vs incumbent PM destabilises nation even if innocence is proved later.

810891209384169500,Mon Dec 19 16:55:04 +0000 2016,Other democracies didn't mature in a day-went thro long transition &amp; reform.Even now they have problems!We only need to hasten our maturity.
810890298859499500,Mon Dec 19 16:51:27 +0000 2016,Perpetual anti-political diatribe, moralising without understanding causality &amp; flippant, poorly conceived ideas do more harm than good.
810889762596716500,Mon Dec 19 16:49:19 +0000 2016,We can, and must, address these challenges by rational, systemic reform.Democracy, esp in a poor, illiterate nation, is tough.We can reform.
810889056791838700,Mon Dec 19 16:46:31 +0000 2016,The winner-take-all FPTP relying on marginal vote, overcentralisation delinking vote from outcomes, poverty &amp; politics as business r causes.
810888108535214100,Mon Dec 19 16:42:45 +0000 2016,But the real challenge is the 90% spend, mostly by candidates, to buy votes. Remember Atalji's famous quip! That needs systemic reform.
810887485802676200,Mon Dec 19 16:40:16 +0000 2016,Right now fear of retribution &amp; culture of black money r leading to large cash contributions to parties. With good sense it can be curbed.
810886914207195100,Mon Dec 19 16:38:00 +0000 2016,Cash funding can be curbed if parties agree not to victimise donors of rival parties&amp;if law provides for hefty penalties for cash donations.
810886389109657600,Mon Dec 19 16:35:55 +0000 2016,Post-Tehelka, parties came together &amp; enacted a good law giving tax incentives to donors.But ₹20k loophole is widely abused &amp; must be curbed
810885618045550600,Mon Dec 19 16:32:51 +0000 2016,Only 10% of election spend is by parties. Major parties r receiving large part in cash which shd be curbed. But real problem is 90% spend.
