601322774796312600,Thu May 21 09:44:56 +0000 2015,@byrneseyeview Hi Byrne, @SatoshiLabs/#TREZOR CTO here. Do you have any direct contact to @21dotco business development department please?
601018306393407500,Wed May 20 13:35:05 +0000 2015,@oleganza I get your concerns, but hacks like modified entropy won't work in #trezor because it's peer reviewed and digitally signed.
601017778309587000,Wed May 20 13:32:59 +0000 2015,@oleganza It cannot run undetectable backdoor, because the whole stack of #trezor is opensource with deterministic builds.
601012098081095700,Wed May 20 13:10:25 +0000 2015,@oleganza For users who don't understand concept of entropy validation, it is just another obstacle in UI, but doesn't improve security.
601011489546305500,Wed May 20 13:08:00 +0000 2015,I disagree on "unconditional entropy" thing. #TREZOR shows it on demand, there's no advantage in showing it to all. https://t.co/M95YQKrMLb
