446308830792544260,Wed Mar 19 15:34:51 +0000 2014,@dubroy It's because we use requestAnimationFrame. Browsers drop those calls when the tab is no longer active, for performance.

323918951019065340,Mon Apr 15 22:01:10 +0000 2013,@chris_vannoy Yeah, no doubt. I guess that's more of a commentary on poorly designed tools.
323918659561082900,Mon Apr 15 22:00:01 +0000 2013,Granted, URLs are low priority during big news events, but they at least should change the page title: "http://t.co/FhRba9qLlq viral video."
323917972911562750,Mon Apr 15 21:57:17 +0000 2013,@dkiesow A link that people have been tweeting: http://t.co/IlUgV5HGG4 The page title is "http://t.co/FhRba9qLlq viral video," too.
323917653532082200,Mon Apr 15 21:56:01 +0000 2013,@jonbukiewicz Of course. I guess the larger point is that the framework was designed with incorrect expectations on how it would be used.

322181153551433700,Thu Apr 11 02:55:47 +0000 2013,@ErikEvenson @tcollen Thanks guys. It'd be nice if they didn't break my site by automatically upgrading the Python version without warning.
322178269673816060,Thu Apr 11 02:44:19 +0000 2013,HEROKU I HATE YOU. Did a simple deploy and they decided to change the Python version, and now my site's down. Moving off of this pronto.

291323764245950460,Tue Jan 15 23:19:32 +0000 2013,@pqfuller Yes, it already supports shift+click to select arbitrary ones. This particular question was just about the keyboard shortcut. :)
291323660210417660,Tue Jan 15 23:19:07 +0000 2013,@waxpancake Cool. Yes, that's the plan (shift+up/down).
291321095951360000,Tue Jan 15 23:08:56 +0000 2013,@waxpancake OK, so always use the right-most annotation as the starting point. Thank you sir.

290108529115799550,Sat Jan 12 14:50:37 +0000 2013,Few may remember this, but Aaron Swartz kickstarted Django's magic-removal effort years ago. Django is 1000x better thanks to his feedback.
290106299612545000,Sat Jan 12 14:41:46 +0000 2013,RT @ftrain: Aaron Swartz is hilarious, humble, and good. He made a more interesting world. The news of his suicide is unbearable.
290103123429716000,Sat Jan 12 14:29:09 +0000 2013,Cannot believe this.
290102876888502300,Sat Jan 12 14:28:10 +0000 2013,Aaron Swartz was one of my favorite people, and I'm crying. http://t.co/kWzPuMsU

289424291991285760,Thu Jan 10 17:31:43 +0000 2013,Just launched undo/redo on @soundslice! It's pretty awesome if I may say. Worth the brain-melting journey to get there. http://t.co/9CCZXLJw
289095231473852400,Wed Jan 09 19:44:08 +0000 2013,@shildner I used @ScreenFlow to create them, and I made sure not to save audio with them. No other tricks beyond that! ScreenFlow is great.
289030117777342460,Wed Jan 09 15:25:24 +0000 2013,@etchalon @pjdoland Field configs in tables is a rite of passage. :-)
289019533161803800,Wed Jan 09 14:43:21 +0000 2013,@etchalon Whoa! I was copying and pasting HTML into documents and FTPing them. Would have *loved* your CMS!
289014744281673700,Wed Jan 09 14:24:19 +0000 2013,RT @codinghorror: "Would you like to install our free app?!?" is the new "It looks like you're writing a letter!"

288343572841902100,Mon Jan 07 17:57:19 +0000 2013,@skabaru Love that before/after thing!
288342619921215500,Mon Jan 07 17:53:32 +0000 2013,@bfirsh Would love to.
288341710508027900,Mon Jan 07 17:49:55 +0000 2013,@andy_c Yes, definitely -- that's on the todo list. Check out more info here: http://t.co/vV46AGTN
288335231612751900,Mon Jan 07 17:24:10 +0000 2013,Implementing "undo/redo" for the first time in my life. Gaining lots of respect for creators of text editors and other undoable things.
287962404422291460,Sun Jan 06 16:42:41 +0000 2013,@ulysseas Thanks -- yes, the Chipy talk featured an early version of the software.
287731691219464200,Sun Jan 06 01:25:55 +0000 2013,@benberkowitz Thanks for checking it out. :-) Suggestions/feedback welcome!
287690448296890370,Sat Jan 05 22:42:02 +0000 2013,@pamelafox I'm going to be adding something like that (combined with a voting system) for @soundslice. Haven't found an off-the-shelf thing.
287634233344794620,Sat Jan 05 18:58:39 +0000 2013,@_entreprenerd I haven't looked at openstack yet...I should!
287561968204783600,Sat Jan 05 14:11:30 +0000 2013,@gnat That's on the to-do list... For fast notes that are even-spaced, I suggest tapping out bars and using annotation splitting (see Help).

287317883481112580,Fri Jan 04 22:01:36 +0000 2013,@iandees I actually tried doing animated GIFs, but (1) the filesize was too large and (2) it took way too long to make good ones.
287302795135164400,Fri Jan 04 21:01:38 +0000 2013,@wilsonminer WHOA, totally forgot about that... It was ahead of its time.

286890882752450560,Thu Jan 03 17:44:51 +0000 2013,@jacobian I'm learning about buildpacks for the first time today -- I appreciate the tip.
286885206705709060,Thu Jan 03 17:22:18 +0000 2013,@pamelafox Fair point! I guess it's more of a question of where you draw the line of responsibility.
286884252006641660,Thu Jan 03 17:18:30 +0000 2013,@paulsmith Aha, I see what you're saying.
286883487250780160,Thu Jan 03 17:15:28 +0000 2013,@paulsmith Technically that's the way it works, because dependencies are listed in a requirements.txt file in the git repo.
286882742468218880,Thu Jan 03 17:12:30 +0000 2013,@roguelynn Cool -- will investigate.
286882386761887740,Thu Jan 03 17:11:05 +0000 2013,@craigkerstiens Last successful deploy was yesterday; app has been around for months. Could it be related to the Heroku Python changes?
286882166204424200,Thu Jan 03 17:10:13 +0000 2013,@roguelynn Interesting, and thanks. I'm not using buildpacks, though... never heard of those...maybe I should use them?
286881823701757950,Thu Jan 03 17:08:51 +0000 2013,@ddemaree Yeah, that's where I've been at as well...

286880610583187460,Thu Jan 03 17:04:02 +0000 2013,ARGH. Is the convenience of @heroku worth the feeling of absolute powerlessness when their service stops working?
286877564868366340,Thu Jan 03 16:51:56 +0000 2013,Great, @heroku deployment appears to be broken for Python. Some sort of pip issue they're having?  https://t.co/qGFsBLLe
