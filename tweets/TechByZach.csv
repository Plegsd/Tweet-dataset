484694429341474800,Thu Jul 03 13:45:31 +0000 2014,@E1NST1N3 the problem is there probably won't be anywhere to go unless he takes a paycut if he wants to compete for a title
484693510558199800,Thu Jul 03 13:41:52 +0000 2014,@E1NST1N3 shoot didn't know that. Yah Stephenson wants to get paid and I don't think indiana will do it.

484560483421126660,Thu Jul 03 04:53:16 +0000 2014,@E1NST1N3 it would be crazy though to see Bosh go back to Toronto. That team would be a serious contender in the East! Also I don't think
484559873120559100,Thu Jul 03 04:50:51 +0000 2014,@E1NST1N3 I think the most plausible thing is, is that their waiting to see what kind of free agents Riley will bring in to help first
