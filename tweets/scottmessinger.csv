788775170609668100,Wed Oct 19 16:13:50 +0000 2016,@toranb While I love state being immutable, it's way harder than I initially imaged to stop rerenders. E.g. redux-reselector for reducers.
788774398757072900,Wed Oct 19 16:10:46 +0000 2016,@toranb but for some drag &amp; drop animation stuff I did yesterday, I needed Ember.set to get the maximum perf so it would fit in a 16ms frame
788774176249315300,Wed Oct 19 16:09:52 +0000 2016,@toranb That all makes sense. I've been impressed by glimmer 2 -- it performs great when I replace the object with another object.
788759175723614200,Wed Oct 19 15:10:16 +0000 2016,@toranb I saw you made some commits for perf in the ember-redux repo.Do you see this approach as equal/better perf as mutable Ember objects?
788758426935496700,Wed Oct 19 15:07:18 +0000 2016,@toranb I worry about perf with this, though. My state tree isn't immutable so dispatches just mutate the state tree (using Ember.set).

651485878334980100,Tue Oct 06 19:55:12 +0000 2015,@wagenet Agreed. Baltimore City is often a city characterized by extremes.For context, I would drove around set of the Wire on way to school
651484898872696800,Tue Oct 06 19:51:18 +0000 2015,@wagenet And by "create structure", I mean in healthy, self-organizing ways that doesn't lead to chaos or harm.
651483989136556000,Tue Oct 06 19:47:41 +0000 2015,@wagenet I think the ability for kids to create structure is really important. And they often learn to create structure by experiencing it
651483837835382800,Tue Oct 06 19:47:05 +0000 2015,@wagenet Great question. Not sure in general, but my students had practically 0 minutes structured play outside of Playworks.
651120503927648300,Mon Oct 05 19:43:20 +0000 2015,@wagenet @lachlan But in my exp in struggling urban school,Playworks is incredible. Teaches the non-academic skills critical to life success

631647540526628900,Thu Aug 13 02:04:43 +0000 2015,While the upgrade path isn't trivial, it exists and sure is easier than rewriting the app in React.js. Thanks Ember core.
631647234568900600,Thu Aug 13 02:03:30 +0000 2015,I'm continually amazed by how dramatically diff architecture of an Ember 1x app is from an Ember 2x app. Props to core team for executing it

576741744370384900,Sat Mar 14 13:48:41 +0000 2015,@dagda1 Let me know when you do -- I'd love to work on that with you.
576741613763985400,Sat Mar 14 13:48:10 +0000 2015,@dagda1 Also, I really liked your implementation. I send deltas to server and thought the action is a nice place to do that.
576741182627274800,Sat Mar 14 13:46:27 +0000 2015,@dagda1 I completely agree with your post about data &amp; ember. I've been thinking about it for a while and it's good to know I'm not alone

569166608859598850,Sat Feb 21 16:07:48 +0000 2015,@mjackson Don't get me wrong -- I still love handlebars. But your comments help me understand the reasons why people prefer JSX. Thanks!
569166273931837440,Sat Feb 21 16:06:28 +0000 2015,@mjackson That makes a lot of sense. It seems Handlebar's use of blocks is a great example of programming language like behavior.
569158811719766000,Sat Feb 21 15:36:49 +0000 2015,Curried my first function. I feel amazing.
569158482945056800,Sat Feb 21 15:35:31 +0000 2015,@mjackson Not a knock on JSX or react ‚Äî I just find it interesting given React's preference for declarative over imperative coding styles.
569158384144027650,Sat Feb 21 15:35:07 +0000 2015,@mjackson Fair enough but I've wondered why templates aren't embraced by react. They're declarative in a way that the JSX I've seen isn't.
567728054051803140,Tue Feb 17 16:51:30 +0000 2015,@mjackson If I want to send JS errors to a service like airbrake, do I have to use window.onerror? Do I wrap components in try/catch?
567518852968230900,Tue Feb 17 03:00:13 +0000 2015,@mjackson Any advice on catching errors in React? Ember has Ember.onerror to catch any errors in app. Does React have onerror in components?

562341247801917440,Mon Feb 02 20:06:15 +0000 2015,@dgeb @bcardarella From what I can tell, the Ember core team puts developer ergonomics above overall system simplicity and data flow
562340657701068800,Mon Feb 02 20:03:55 +0000 2015,@bcardarella @dgeb I see React's view diffing as just an impl detail ‚Äî the compelling value is how they think about state and data flow

509726240811786240,Wed Sep 10 15:33:00 +0000 2014,@edsurge @panopen 8. Last point: I do 100% agree with paying faculty to collaborate on textbooks. Also happens in OSS. See Redhat &amp; Linux.
509725695761981440,Wed Sep 10 15:30:50 +0000 2014,@edsurge @panopen 7. Also, textbooks (K-20) are more like OSS than lesson plans, so easier to see OSS model.
509725481613402100,Wed Sep 10 15:29:59 +0000 2014,@EdSurge @panopen 6. My thoughts apply to K12 lesson sharing. Higher ed is different b/c # of lessons is 1/50 K12.
509724579909349400,Wed Sep 10 15:26:24 +0000 2014,@edSurge @panopen 5. OER won't work while orgs waste millions with their heads in the clouds chasing fantasies. They need to solve problems
509723796337885200,Wed Sep 10 15:23:17 +0000 2014,@edSurge @panopen 4. You can't put the energy into 3 OSS projects that you can into HUNDREDS of lessons.
509723563256201200,Wed Sep 10 15:22:22 +0000 2014,@edSurge @panopen 3. There are a handful of OSS per person or company. There are HUNDREDS of lessons per teacher per year
509723222645157900,Wed Sep 10 15:21:01 +0000 2014,@edSurge @panopen 2. Humans are self-interested. Github solves problem of collaboration for debs. By product is sharing with larger world.

496325632289423360,Mon Aug 04 16:03:46 +0000 2014,@leninnightingal @EdwinThwaites @shibley We have to stop comparing CC and ed to a utopia that doesn't exist. Is it better than what exists?
496325417884999700,Mon Aug 04 16:02:55 +0000 2014,@leninnightingal @EdwinThwaites @shibley Agreed. Being a knowledgeable teacher takes decades. Also, all people keep issues off agenda.

479291193121984500,Wed Jun 18 15:54:59 +0000 2014,@dgeb That's cool! I used a polling strategy so I didn't have to handle cases where a missing patch stops future patches from being applied
479289550624149500,Wed Jun 18 15:48:28 +0000 2014,@dgeb One of the challenges I encountered is enforcing order. Messages from the server have to arrive in order to the client and vice versa.

477544009393782800,Fri Jun 13 20:12:18 +0000 2014,I really appreciate Devise but why in the world would they redirect a failed registration to a different URL? All the relative links break.
477214068135034900,Thu Jun 12 22:21:14 +0000 2014,@schneems @sixwing Nothing in the previous app. Literally, nothing other than DB call and JSON response in a controller action.
477213546875330560,Thu Jun 12 22:19:10 +0000 2014,@schneems @sixwing The gave up trying to fix it 9 months ago w/different app. I'll try the UUID thing -- maybe we'll get a fix this time.
477213354386133000,Thu Jun 12 22:18:24 +0000 2014,@schneems @sixwing I've sent MB of logs to Heroku and no one has ever figured out why some requests just seem to die in the Heroku router
477213224572440600,Thu Jun 12 22:17:53 +0000 2014,@schneems @sixwing Thanks! Sadly, I've been through this w heroku b4. No consistency to controller/action. Just DB calls &amp; JSON response.
477211582045245440,Thu Jun 12 22:11:21 +0000 2014,@sixwing What confuses me is NewRelic shows my average memory stays pretty constant: http://t.co/jWKP1zaPuX and far below 512MB
477210828114894850,Thu Jun 12 22:08:22 +0000 2014,@sixwing Thanks! I'll take a look. Any good tools for finding a memory leak in rails?
477208894477856800,Thu Jun 12 22:00:41 +0000 2014,@sixwing Also, why would my app‚Äôs memory keep growing? Is that something wrong in my code or a characteristic of Puma?
477208761699147800,Thu Jun 12 22:00:09 +0000 2014,@sixwing My app should be thread safe. Thanks for the link. Shouldn‚Äôt a 512MB server be able to handle 2 workers and 3 threads?
477206509416628200,Thu Jun 12 21:51:12 +0000 2014,@sixwing Right now, min_threads is 3, max_threads is 3 and workers is 2. Which eats up more memory? Threads or workers?
477204575636582400,Thu Jun 12 21:43:31 +0000 2014,@sixwing Not that I can think of.
477204012144816100,Thu Jun 12 21:41:17 +0000 2014,@sixwing The H12s might have been caused when I lowered the Puma thread count to 1 and raised the workers to 5 (v189).I changed it back v190
477195912876290050,Thu Jun 12 21:09:06 +0000 2014,@sixwing I'd really appreciate it if you took a look. at the logs I'm not sure why the app's memory usage appears to grow over time.
477194475471532000,Thu Jun 12 21:03:23 +0000 2014,@sixwing This is a new app with a new server (Puma), so I was hoping the H12s would go away.
477194361000587260,Thu Jun 12 21:02:56 +0000 2014,@sixwing Thanks for your help with this, btw. I really like heroku and everyone I've talked to has been great, but I've hit H12 for a year
477194123753963500,Thu Jun 12 21:01:59 +0000 2014,@sixwing I am. I'm seeing R14s. Not sure why. I'm using Puma with fewer workers and threads than Heroku recommends. Any ideas?
477193203347886100,Thu Jun 12 20:58:20 +0000 2014,@sixwing Sadly, it‚Äôs happened with every app I‚Äôve had on Heroku. It‚Äôs gentle-waters-2168.
477184390204624900,Thu Jun 12 20:23:18 +0000 2014,@jakemauer Here‚Äôs how you do it: Digest::MD5.hexdigest(ActionView::Base.assets_manifest.assets.values.sort.join).
477178278956896260,Thu Jun 12 19:59:01 +0000 2014,.@heroku never fails to disappoint me. The H12 Timeout Errors happen to me without fail. Every day. Any server: Puma, Unicorn, Thin.
477115870385557500,Thu Jun 12 15:51:02 +0000 2014,.@mongohq‚Äôs support is fantastic. I asked if for help with the performance of a query &amp; they gave a helpful, detailed response within hours
476384583458770940,Tue Jun 10 15:25:10 +0000 2014,@trackjs Thanks for asking! Again, I think it‚Äôs the best approach to JS tracking out there.
476384317158199300,Tue Jun 10 15:24:06 +0000 2014,@trackjs 4) Better support for meta data about the user. E.g. their name, email, etc.
476384078124810240,Tue Jun 10 15:23:09 +0000 2014,@trackjs With track, it‚Äôs hard to make sense of how many different errors have happened or if I‚Äôm seeing one error 30 times.
476383983794929660,Tue Jun 10 15:22:47 +0000 2014,@trackjs 3) Grouping of errors and the ability to resolve them. Honeybadger does this better than anyone I‚Äôve seen.
476383841117274100,Tue Jun 10 15:22:13 +0000 2014,@trackjs 2) Better parsing of objects that are sent to tracks.error. I get [object] [object] more than once.
476383689845125100,Tue Jun 10 15:21:37 +0000 2014,@trackjs 1) Notifications. I have a SPA. An error on the client is just as bad as an error on the server for a traditional app
476379883702997000,Tue Jun 10 15:06:29 +0000 2014,Is there anyway to determine the fingerprint of an asset in rails? I‚Äôd like to notify the user the should refresh b/c the JS changed.
476375916730662900,Tue Jun 10 14:50:43 +0000 2014,.@trackjs is a great take on JS tracking, but not ready for primetime.I wish another service tracked console.logs b4 an error like trackjs

458267541652381700,Mon Apr 21 15:34:30 +0000 2014,@Twin66 I really agree with your suspicion of corporations. State education &amp; district leaders/curric writers reviewed standards. I was one.
458265139045990400,Mon Apr 21 15:24:57 +0000 2014,@Twin66 Blaming it on the ‚Äúelite‚Äù is just intellectual laziness. People on both sides care about kids. I think you care about kids.
458264648383733760,Mon Apr 21 15:23:00 +0000 2014,@Twin66 I‚Äôm confused by your confusing over standards vs curriculum. You can call the Common Core curriculum all day‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt make it true
457573365285273600,Sat Apr 19 17:36:06 +0000 2014,@Twin66 If the states had idea, control the creation, the process, and choice to adopt the standards, sounds like states rights to me.
457572904172269600,Sat Apr 19 17:34:16 +0000 2014,@Twin66 Also, let's remember that state's led the effort. State ed chiefs started discussing in 2007. NGA started work in 4/09...before RTTT
457572401773944800,Sat Apr 19 17:32:16 +0000 2014,@Twin66 You can't demand state's right and freedom then when your state makes an unforced choice, criticize the fed government for offering
457572155052396540,Sat Apr 19 17:31:17 +0000 2014,@Twin66 Also, I was looking at early drafts of the standards in 2009. There was time to review. And they were reviewed.
457571909886943200,Sat Apr 19 17:30:19 +0000 2014,@Twin66 Oh, you mean because you didn't like the choice your state made, it's a bribe? State's didn't have to accept the money. Freedom!
457561701353676800,Sat Apr 19 16:49:45 +0000 2014,@Twin66 No worse. Hopefully better. At worse, same ol' corporate crap. At best, a state led effort to share resources.
457560993036378100,Sat Apr 19 16:46:56 +0000 2014,@Twin66 It's always been a state lead and state controlled thing.
457560888224927740,Sat Apr 19 16:46:31 +0000 2014,@Twin66 Corporations step in when states fail to cooperate. I'm excited states are choosing to pool resources. CC came from Ntl. Gov Assoc.
457560503993118700,Sat Apr 19 16:44:59 +0000 2014,@Twin66 I agree. Corporate curriculum pretty bad. Common Core allows states to partner together to take corporate publishers out of picture
457559904413167600,Sat Apr 19 16:42:36 +0000 2014,@wycats Totally agree. 4 weeks is awesome. I've also been thinking of offering a longer, paid sabbatical every few years. Maybe 3 months?

457221112133615600,Fri Apr 18 18:16:22 +0000 2014,@Twin66 the question is not whether the new materials will be perfect--will they be better than the crap that's sold now?
457220670578262000,Fri Apr 18 18:14:37 +0000 2014,@Twin66 are you at all familiar with the atrocious curriculum paddled by the big corporate publishers aligned to the current standards?

193371654645219330,Fri Apr 20 16:12:49 +0000 2012,On a related note, Baltimore offers no advantage over other cities for starting an K12 EdTech company. Except it's cheap to live here.
193371089404043260,Fri Apr 20 16:10:35 +0000 2012,When people say "EdTech" they should clarify if they mean K-12, higher ed, or adult education. Not all markets are created equally.

156723857632399360,Tue Jan 10 13:07:34 +0000 2012,@davetroy I'm not sure one exists. I *think* I've seen studies showing little/no impact of 1:1 laptop initiatives. I'll check today.
156435910383251460,Mon Jan 09 18:03:22 +0000 2012,@jessgartner @davetroy The reasoning is normally "tech makes ed better!"instead of "this specific problem is uniquely solved by tech."
156435701779546100,Mon Jan 09 18:02:32 +0000 2012,@jessgartner @davetroy I think the edtech movement discredits itself by pushing for tech instead of articulating how tech solves ed problems
156434063899635700,Mon Jan 09 17:56:01 +0000 2012,@jessgartner @davetroy mentioned he hasn't heard a how or why the MacBooks will contribute to outcomes.

156412778352091140,Mon Jan 09 16:31:27 +0000 2012,@davetroy I agree. I think tech is seen as a silver bullet and poorly thought out.The problems it's supposed to solve are rarely articulated

153017230139994100,Sat Dec 31 07:38:45 +0000 2011,@wycats ember has cool naming conventions but I'm not sure what they all are. A quick conventions naming chart would really help me out.

91358900720373760,Thu Jul 14 04:10:33 +0000 2011,While I remain unenthused about devise, it turns out my problems weren't because of it. I was failing to pass a CSRF token with my AJAX req.

91228790872743940,Wed Jul 13 19:33:33 +0000 2011,@subelsky That's how I feel. I also don't want to write the recover password stuff.
91228507396505600,Wed Jul 13 19:32:25 +0000 2011,@mattdarby Are you using Omniauth for all your authentication? Do you have users enroll in your app? If so, how if you're using Omniauth?
91227768502747140,Wed Jul 13 19:29:29 +0000 2011,@subelsky I don't think my problems have to do with mongo...I think it's related to namespaces. Devise apparently hates them.with a passion.
91226627857588220,Wed Jul 13 19:24:57 +0000 2011,I'd just like to emphasize that my exp with devise makes me BAFFLED how it EVER got to have 4400+ followers on gh.I must be in the minority.

90576631441272830,Tue Jul 12 00:22:06 +0000 2011,However, since devise doesn't come with mongo mapper support out of the box, getting it working takes time.
90575644768993280,Tue Jul 12 00:18:11 +0000 2011,The devise + mongo_mapper problems have mostly been solved...I had both mongoid and mongo_mapper in my gemfile...devise tried using mongoid

77818468539432960,Mon Jun 06 19:25:43 +0000 2011,@tomdale I can agree that state over events in great. Regardless, I don't want to manually update DOM or use helpers. I want html.
77738386315685890,Mon Jun 06 14:07:30 +0000 2011,@Hwaet Thanks! I'll probably do this. Before I do, I want to define the problem a bit better. My understanding is too general at this point.
77735504078045180,Mon Jun 06 13:56:03 +0000 2011,@Hwaet I'm trying to figure out a good schema for a permission system in mongodb. Do you know of any good blog posts about the topic?
77735232207462400,Mon Jun 06 13:54:58 +0000 2011,@jonathanjulian I'm looking forward to your talk on rendering views client side. What templating language do you prefer? Mustache?
77722650918666240,Mon Jun 06 13:04:58 +0000 2011,@Colin_Campbell I think it could be made better by not just being handlebars.I like data-attr like knockout orbatman.js http://bit.ly/m0veUC
77586283995729920,Mon Jun 06 04:03:06 +0000 2011,@Colin_Campbell the simplest example: the todo list. I want to mark it up with ul and li tags that I declare and bind it to the model.
77582515178709000,Mon Jun 06 03:48:07 +0000 2011,@Colin_Campbell Thanks! I really like SC's features, but I want to declare my own markup, not have generated tags or use helpers. How?
77563659093680130,Mon Jun 06 02:33:12 +0000 2011,@tomdale If I have to manually update the DOM with observers, why would I use SC2? Why not backbone.js? Auto updating is the killer feature
77561706368348160,Mon Jun 06 02:25:26 +0000 2011,Sproutcore 2.0 is billed as a Backbone.js competitor.However, SC2.0 makes it near impossible to build a page in html & get the markup I want
77558633692528640,Mon Jun 06 02:13:13 +0000 2011,I'm like the data binding in batman.js...it makes so much sense. http://batmanjs.org/alfred.html
77554871561224200,Mon Jun 06 01:58:16 +0000 2011,I'm trying really hard to like the view layer on Sproutcore...but I can't get over my dislike of handlebar helpers. I like HTML.

77142027455832060,Sat Jun 04 22:37:47 +0000 2011,@wycats agreed. a long func is cramming to much in data-attr but shldn't a long func go in the model layer anyways regardless of data attr?

76333888905019400,Thu Jun 02 17:06:31 +0000 2011,@wycats I love data-attributes. They're transparent, easy for a designer to pick up, and simple to reason about. e.g. http://bit.ly/iorhnT
76328404449902600,Thu Jun 02 16:44:44 +0000 2011,@wycats I love the DOM updates but can that happen with simpler, more HTML driven handlebar templ? In the SC todo app, 2/17 lines are html.

76284280644448260,Thu Jun 02 13:49:24 +0000 2011,@webandy I'm confused...is this in partnership with LivingSocial? Aren't they an investor in you guys?
76132028898226180,Thu Jun 02 03:44:24 +0000 2011,@wycats I think the workings of {{collection ....}} is opaque and makes it hard to distinguish the diff between SC and handlebars.
76131454286954500,Thu Jun 02 03:42:07 +0000 2011,@wycats I'm going through the Sproutcore 2.0 todo app guide. The guide is easy to follow but I want more html and less handlebars.
76076654606303230,Thu Jun 02 00:04:22 +0000 2011,@eee_c That's what I figured. That's too bad. I would have loved to have heard @j3's talk. @j3 are you posting the slides?

17493829884055552,Wed Dec 22 08:17:08 +0000 2010,@j3 I had to require carrierwave as well. I copied and pasted the preinitializer off the bundler website. So weird. Easily 4 hours of work.
