856750060884774900,Tue Apr 25 06:01:46 +0000 2017,That final song as Alex turned over all the work of the Task Force was once again @HFTRR's 'Settle'.
856749760547504100,Tue Apr 25 06:00:35 +0000 2017,What a moment for Owlex. So now Alex must go deep undercover. And in one hell of a jacket.
856749279657861100,Tue Apr 25 05:58:40 +0000 2017,It's not just Ryan who got burned by the reporter, it's the whole task force and Claire!
856748596271620100,Tue Apr 25 05:55:57 +0000 2017,Well, that's one way to make Clay hate you again, Shelby.
856747758866186200,Tue Apr 25 05:52:37 +0000 2017,I have used that checkmate gif multiple times in my personal life, no lie.
856747082681425900,Tue Apr 25 05:49:56 +0000 2017,So a third Haas man falls for Shelby Wyatt ... and asks for a promise to never be more than friends at best.
856746662483578900,Tue Apr 25 05:48:16 +0000 2017,Alex's interaction with Maxwell has her shook ... and on a collision course with Ryan. And they're both just doing it to protect the team.
856744676979687400,Tue Apr 25 05:40:23 +0000 2017,So now we know who ordered the hit on Leon! And Sasha! What's your beef with the press? Ice cold, Alice Winters, ice cold.

856742303834165200,Tue Apr 25 05:30:57 +0000 2017,Ryan going rogue? Felix onto Raina? Theo rebuffing Shelby? Were the Collaborators ahead the entire time?

856741421574791200,Tue Apr 25 05:27:27 +0000 2017,Fun fact: this party was shot is an old Vanderbilt mansion. Felt exactly like the kind of place the Haas family would hang out.

856739148383739900,Tue Apr 25 05:18:25 +0000 2017,This sweet, soul song is Dinah Washington's 'Baby, You Got What It Takes'
856738821660004400,Tue Apr 25 05:17:07 +0000 2017,Ben Affleck as Batman. Not Ben Affleck in Batman. A subtle, but important difference.
856738498178568200,Tue Apr 25 05:15:50 +0000 2017,So Maxine and Elizabeth Warren are power lunching. To be a fly on that wall ...

706686504421236700,Mon Mar 07 03:42:46 +0000 2016,Thanks for getting #quantico trending you guys! Now sit back and relax... kidding!!! Gonna get crazy before its over!
706686325861326800,Mon Mar 07 03:42:04 +0000 2016,what? Alex? tricks? ;) https://t.co/pwfuWRYlXU
706686123339292700,Mon Mar 07 03:41:16 +0000 2016,This is the truth of Alex. She does what has to be done with integrity. Always has. Which is such a powerful stand for a character #quantico
706685485570252800,Mon Mar 07 03:38:43 +0000 2016,That's a hard lesson to learn: criminals don't fight fair. You don't go up against rules. You go up against ruthless enemies. #Quantico
706684976062931000,Mon Mar 07 03:36:42 +0000 2016,Being accused of being a terrorist gives Alex a unique view of the world something no other agent has. #Quantico
706684385743999000,Mon Mar 07 03:34:21 +0000 2016,@iiffiy its what we do best!
706683651061370900,Mon Mar 07 03:31:26 +0000 2016,Remember when Alex and Ryan couldn't be alone without tearing each others clothes off. Will #Ralex ever get their groove back? #quantico
706683156829773800,Mon Mar 07 03:29:28 +0000 2016,They call this the "Oceans 11" play. And it worked. #quantico

706681926715834400,Mon Mar 07 03:24:35 +0000 2016,How awful it must be to know that a student you taught became a terrorist... #Quantico

706679934140424200,Mon Mar 07 03:16:40 +0000 2016,Shelby vs. Iris is going to give you so much life. "Sorry. I just hit hard." #Quantico

706678008451616800,Mon Mar 07 03:09:01 +0000 2016,Theory One: Elias made up the second terrorist as a ploy to get people into ECC. Theory Two/Alex: He didn't work alone. #Quantico
706677784995885000,Mon Mar 07 03:08:08 +0000 2016,Love this apartment, it looks like a real NY apartment. One of those sets that completely screws up your sense of reality when you're on it.
706677090045796400,Mon Mar 07 03:05:22 +0000 2016,Also now wondering if bootycalled is one word per @Jay_A_Johnson or hyphenated? #Quantico
