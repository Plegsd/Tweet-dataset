900505714061443100,Wed Aug 23 23:51:07 +0000 2017,Ok. What have we learned? Sal wants NYC to be Athens. BdB thinks the homeless tide will turn. BdB promises to stay 4 yrs.Politics expensive.
900503971596468200,Wed Aug 23 23:44:12 +0000 2017,Are we getting a lightning round? The people want a lightning round! And we want Grace to question BdB on ethics.
