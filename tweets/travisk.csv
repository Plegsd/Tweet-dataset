534798250432561150,Tue Nov 18 20:00:13 +0000 2014,13/ and that also goes for Emil ..
534796282125352960,Tue Nov 18 19:52:24 +0000 2014,12/ I believe that folks who make mistakes can learn from them ‚Äì myself included.
534790769924919300,Tue Nov 18 19:30:30 +0000 2014,11/ And furthermore, I will do everything in my power towards the goal of earning that trust.
534790695157248000,Tue Nov 18 19:30:12 +0000 2014,10/ We are up to the challenge to show that Uber is and will continue to be a positive member of the community
534790627368914940,Tue Nov 18 19:29:56 +0000 2014,9/ But I will personally commit to our riders, partners and the public that we are up to the challenge
534790544510431200,Tue Nov 18 19:29:36 +0000 2014,8/ The burden is on us to show that, and until Emil‚Äôs comments we felt we were making positive steps along those lines
534790466454446100,Tue Nov 18 19:29:17 +0000 2014,7/ We must tell the stories of progress Uber has brought to cities and show the our constituents that we are principled and mean well
534790393351897100,Tue Nov 18 19:29:00 +0000 2014,6/ We must be open and vulnerable enough to show people the positive principles that are the core of Uber‚Äôs culture
534790305401544700,Tue Nov 18 19:28:39 +0000 2014,5/ We should tell the stories of progress and appeal to people‚Äôs hearts and minds
534790200132894700,Tue Nov 18 19:28:14 +0000 2014,4/ Instead, we should lead by inspiring our riders, our drivers and the public at large.
534790043605663740,Tue Nov 18 19:27:36 +0000 2014,3/ His duties here at Uber do not involve communications strategy or plans and are not representative in any way of the company approach
534789934490857500,Tue Nov 18 19:27:10 +0000 2014,2/ His remarks showed a lack of leadership, a lack of humanity, and a departure from our values and ideals

252519977175896060,Sun Sep 30 21:27:08 +0000 2012,@colinmlenton we are going to find a way to give those drivers the ability to cost-efficiently start their own business

252519506461749250,Sun Sep 30 21:25:16 +0000 2012,@colinmlenton I'm fairly certain that the folks ur hearing tipping issues from are drivers that aren't generally getting compensated enough

252514190797967360,Sun Sep 30 21:04:09 +0000 2012,@colinmlenton again, they would get that to their personal acct, and then the sedan co. would lower their % cut of the rest of the fare
