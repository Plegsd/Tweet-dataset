1491050880,Fri Apr 10 15:43:46 +0000 2009,Wondering... are corporate jets as luxe as we think they are?
1485998815,Thu Apr 09 20:54:21 +0000 2009,@nwjerseyliz Got it.... I was kinda in your 'hood this week. Dutchess Co & NYC. Switching to Spring anytime soon?
1485572397,Thu Apr 09 19:41:08 +0000 2009,@nwjerseyliz You saying there IS such a thing as bad publicity?
1446903311,Fri Apr 03 18:20:07 +0000 2009,Seems like most of Washington left when Congress did last night. Cept for Cherry Blossom tourists. They're filling the restaurants.
1425284202,Tue Mar 31 16:22:24 +0000 2009,In category of better late than never: Just came back from Pittsburgh. Seemed really cool. But the commute would do me in....
1397104265,Thu Mar 26 21:56:32 +0000 2009,@nwjerseyliz I'd choose door #4, escapism. & do we all wanna compete in our tales of woe? Or so it seems to me.
1396188858,Thu Mar 26 19:11:41 +0000 2009,@jdickerson Escape Hybrids have been the vehicle of choice on Cap Hill for a while, no? US-made, enviro-hip, more imposing than a Prius.
1390324372,Wed Mar 25 21:01:49 +0000 2009,@rumours78 Whoops! It got bumped. Tomorrow, presumably. The suspense (?) mounts.
1388101852,Wed Mar 25 14:16:06 +0000 2009,@rumours78 No, back in DC doing more interviews & writing. Piece should run abt 4.35ET.
1384414236,Tue Mar 24 22:24:19 +0000 2009,Still pondering The Region. Never had time to find a decent restaurant. Maybe have something on the air Wed afternoon.
1357342128,Thu Mar 19 23:33:57 +0000 2009,@nwjerseyliz Bunnies in yard, & radon under it? I remember NW Jersey was a, er, hotbed. But lovely if you don't excavate.
1357296797,Thu Mar 19 23:24:29 +0000 2009,@rumours78 Thanks for the tin yurl. Shoulda looked that up before I came out. But it doesn't tell me where to go for dinner.
1357258629,Thu Mar 19 23:16:23 +0000 2009,@nwjerseyliz Worked for a paper there in the 80s. Went from stranger-in-a-strange-land at first, to often missing it now.
1357228936,Thu Mar 19 23:10:37 +0000 2009,@rumours78 "The region"? Why? Makes it sound so isolated, pretty much the exact opposite of reality.
1357055354,Thu Mar 19 22:29:17 +0000 2009,In NW Indiana. Almost like being back in North Jersey, but with more elbow room.
1343355764,Tue Mar 17 17:31:39 +0000 2009,@hungrymarshall Whaddaya recommend, culinarily [?] speaking, for Lake Co & NW Ind?
1343310969,Tue Mar 17 17:24:11 +0000 2009,@DougHenwood -- Question: The bonuses go to gang that drove AIG into ditch, or to new gang hired to close down AIGFP? -- confused in DC
1337043440,Mon Mar 16 16:21:43 +0000 2009,@acarvin re Imus -- He'll learn, unless there's a denial thing going on here. Or he's in habit of writing "prostrate" for other reasons.
1323979086,Fri Mar 13 21:10:31 +0000 2009,Newspapers... cars... banks.... race to the bottom?
1311689707,Wed Mar 11 17:40:19 +0000 2009,Q: How many million$ can unions & corporations spend lobbying Employee Free Choice Act? What's per-cap cost per congressional vote?
1305788228,Tue Mar 10 15:24:22 +0000 2009,Earmarks! Pork! Omnibus! If they make your pulse race, join Ken Rudin, Reihan Salam (Atlantic) & me for an online chat. Noon ET, npr.org.
1301185069,Mon Mar 09 17:06:02 +0000 2009,@arthurat You mean every day isn't napping day? That's just wrong.
1300009460,Mon Mar 09 12:04:15 +0000 2009,@emptysandwich Hmm. RABA makes me wonder: boondoggle, long-range dev scheme, or both? Like Bridge to Nowhere, aka Ketchikan airport access.
1290582474,Fri Mar 06 22:51:16 +0000 2009,Another Friday afternoon, another indictment in the Abramoff case. Such symmetry. This time, a former ctte aide to Don Young.
1285425794,Thu Mar 05 21:51:06 +0000 2009,Back in Earmark World aka Congress: Pete Visclosky wants ethics investigation of PMA Group? But hopes someone else asks for it?
1285028950,Thu Mar 05 20:23:46 +0000 2009,@kateflaim What? You ditched the m/c & sidecar?
1278864737,Wed Mar 04 15:24:53 +0000 2009,@djcitymaus Thank you v much, DJCM. It's good to be seen.
1274884471,Tue Mar 03 18:30:47 +0000 2009,@npr100days How about a stop at Tunica MS? Casinos & cotton.
1259829176,Fri Feb 27 21:34:37 +0000 2009,@emptysandwich I'd say some is eye-of-beholder. But sometimes the beauty's in the no-bid contract, or the kickback, or... &c.
1258822791,Fri Feb 27 17:14:50 +0000 2009,Thinking about fraud & waste in Stim spending. IG Earl Devaney is sposed to keep a lid on it. Can he? Can anyone?
1251165837,Wed Feb 25 22:24:21 +0000 2009,@btx91 Tnx. Yeah, twas joint NPR-CIR project. Ended after the election, but still at http://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/
1250806838,Wed Feb 25 20:53:50 +0000 2009,Just read govt's sentencing memo on Dusty Foggo, fmr CIA #3 caught via Duke Cunningham case. Maybe the toughest such memo I've ever seen.
1250660358,Wed Feb 25 20:17:04 +0000 2009,@btx91 - Yeah, that's how I got here. Now wondering where it'll lead....
1250218331,Wed Feb 25 18:23:38 +0000 2009,@btx91 -- Why the shift? Secret Money Project & collab w Ctr for Investigative Reporting both ended. I'm back to solo reporting.
1249874482,Wed Feb 25 16:55:50 +0000 2009,@nancyscola -- Oh, like I'm doing now. ... Point taken.
1249701462,Wed Feb 25 16:12:21 +0000 2009,@Mlsif -- @nancyscola has a point, but what I got from Milbank was the inanity of MCs' Tweets. Whittman's sitting behind McCain? Oh wow.
1245863918,Tue Feb 24 18:36:51 +0000 2009,Hmm. Earmarks. By Wed night, if it wants, House can both pass bill w 8500 of 'em... and launch ethics probe of earmarks & cmpn money.
1245264254,Tue Feb 24 15:50:06 +0000 2009,@btx91 -- That's right, no longer a feed. Just a reporter's thoughts... or more likely, head-scratching type comments & questions.
