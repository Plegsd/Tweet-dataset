691525598984818700,Mon Jan 25 07:38:45 +0000 2016,6/ Track the growth funnel. New=Old+Acquired+Reactivated-Churn. Tons of insights to be gleaned here. Eg beware the leaky bucket.
691525549148106800,Mon Jan 25 07:38:33 +0000 2016,5/ Cohorts are invaluable, but can be noisy early. Consider engagement as a proxy in early days (e.g. DAU/MAU).
691525498816430100,Mon Jan 25 07:38:21 +0000 2016,4/ Users will change as channel split evolves. Measure blended CAC, but also paid CAC. Life a lot easier if unit economics works with latter
691525409742024700,Mon Jan 25 07:38:00 +0000 2016,3/ LTV more useful than % repeat, but harder to measure until retention curve flattens. Eg 12-month data is not 12x month 1 data :)
691525357778767900,Mon Jan 25 07:37:47 +0000 2016,2/ Eg. consider MAUs net of new installs. On a small base, %age growth numbers can look overly promising. So can %age of repeats.
