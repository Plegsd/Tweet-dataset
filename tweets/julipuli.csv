514883590916550660,Wed Sep 24 21:06:28 +0000 2014,@UnboxTherapy Can you DM me if you get a chance? Had a quick question about the bending videos.
514879413003878400,Wed Sep 24 20:49:52 +0000 2014,@PaulWMather I don't think there's any conspiracy here given the bending claims have been supported by third party images.
514879285090209800,Wed Sep 24 20:49:22 +0000 2014,@PaulWMather He says in the video it bent a bit in his pocket like the myriad other photos we've seen of a bent iPhone 6 Plus from a pocket

514827551064068100,Wed Sep 24 17:23:47 +0000 2014,No functional phone = no bending because you don't need to take it with you. Problem solved.
514826473878724600,Wed Sep 24 17:19:31 +0000 2014,No service remains after restart... and Touch ID is broken.

514286940695191550,Tue Sep 23 05:35:36 +0000 2014,@saboortweets No idea what the problem could be. I'd say try again later or visit the Apple Store and see if they can help there.
514286275642146800,Tue Sep 23 05:32:57 +0000 2014,@saboortweets I think it is, but I do upgrade with every new phone. iPhone 5s is still very capable, but larger screen is awesome.
514285584152399900,Tue Sep 23 05:30:12 +0000 2014,@saboortweets Sounds like it could possibly be a server issue, especially if you're not having general connection problems.

511690963169734660,Tue Sep 16 01:40:07 +0000 2014,@hmweinerman She turned 10 this year. Has had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy since 2, so might be seizures from blood clots going to her brain.
511690706306342900,Tue Sep 16 01:39:05 +0000 2014,@hmweinerman Otherwise seizures may be idiopathic and she'll go on anti-convulsives.

510899061151379460,Sat Sep 13 21:13:22 +0000 2014,@MarkasB Yeah, going to see if I can find some good reviews on it. One concern with Aura is lack of portability (for travel).
510898392277319700,Sat Sep 13 21:10:43 +0000 2014,@JackGMarch @Objective_Neo Yeah. Most exciting part about Ô£øWatch is how awesome it'll be 5 years from now.
