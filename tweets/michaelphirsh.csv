161637381861158900,Tue Jan 24 02:32:09 +0000 2012,Mitt relentless. Newt pauses for breath and seems to decide .... he's going to stay moderate Newt.. #FLDebate
161636807254097920,Tue Jan 24 02:29:52 +0000 2012,Now Mitt getting into it. Just effectively accused Newt about lying on the historian bit.. let's see how long moderate New lasts. #FLDebate

160178766457479170,Fri Jan 20 01:56:08 +0000 2012,....  but a good debater is not what you want in the WH. You want "steady," not unstable like Newt. Sorry Rick, you need to be less subtle
160177712512778240,Fri Jan 20 01:51:57 +0000 2012,OK, so Santorum just conceded that Newt's a much better debater than he is.....
160175480102862850,Fri Jan 20 01:43:05 +0000 2012,Rick and Newt tearing each other to shreds, and Mitt smiling up a storm....
160173986397949950,Fri Jan 20 01:37:08 +0000 2012,OK, so at least Santorum, with absolutely nothing to lose, is attacking Romney head on over health care even if Newt isn't.
160170349898645500,Fri Jan 20 01:22:41 +0000 2012,Mitt clearly loaded for bear going after Bain's critics... how many hours of prepping went into this defense today, i wonder?
160169651693817860,Fri Jan 20 01:19:55 +0000 2012,Newt's failure to attack romney is still puzzling, despite the grieff he's taken over attacking bain. why?
160168711372816400,Fri Jan 20 01:16:11 +0000 2012,Paul's talking about money. Which means it's time for a bathroom break.

159113953962758140,Tue Jan 17 03:24:57 +0000 2012,Perry piling imbecility upon stupidity: the housing market is stuck in the mud. Even the Fed wants Fannie and Freddie to cut principal

159110610855006200,Tue Jan 17 03:11:40 +0000 2012,Mitt shamelessly playing to the Right on a policy--negotiating with the Taliban--that he knows must happen, and that every general favors
159110140681920500,Tue Jan 17 03:09:48 +0000 2012,note that almost whatever Mitt says--even his hemming and hawing over tax returns--gets big cheers? another sign of a locked-up nomination
