200134067126153200,Wed May 09 08:04:14 +0000 2012,He told me that he had approached several television and news outlets to refute the story and make it up to me, but no one was interested..
200133128923250700,Wed May 09 08:00:30 +0000 2012,Because the man I met was about 6 foot four and had a Dutch accent". But by that time he had signed his statement.
200132203424915460,Wed May 09 07:56:50 +0000 2012,again, who was the celebrity he had supposedly met in the dark? They told him it was me, to which he replied "But that's impossible....

200124353243910140,Wed May 09 07:25:38 +0000 2012,A 'spokesman' says that I was never asked to participate. By which I suppose they mean they didn't actually have my phone number, so...
200123677084364800,Wed May 09 07:22:57 +0000 2012,So apparently I'm lying about being approached by the Leveson Inquiry.

199779616553046000,Tue May 08 08:35:46 +0000 2012,It's interesting don't you think, that not one newspaper went near the things I said in defence of gay teenagers last week.
