488844881092018200,Tue Jul 15 00:37:56 +0000 2014,@YouthAndWork @_SimonBlack Agree. For me, the moral argument is sufficient. For others, not the case, hence the econ/soc/psych points.
488841476948783100,Tue Jul 15 00:24:25 +0000 2014,@_SimonBlack Why not do both? Investing in pre-k frees up time and resources to enter the labor market

488783996449345540,Mon Jul 14 20:36:00 +0000 2014,@VassB Finally, the ‚Äúit‚Äôs too difficult to implement‚Äù argument can literally be used against any idea or policy. Let‚Äôs move past it.
488783424983797760,Mon Jul 14 20:33:44 +0000 2014,@VassB And for me, the moral argument is the most important. If we blv inequality must be reduced, need to start at earliest years.
488783280565518340,Mon Jul 14 20:33:09 +0000 2014,@VassB The argument wasn‚Äôt just OECD-based. OECD aside, the economic, social, psychological benefits are sufficient by themselves.
488773381450248200,Mon Jul 14 19:53:49 +0000 2014,@VassB We agree to partially agree.
488771735026536450,Mon Jul 14 19:47:17 +0000 2014,@VassB Haven‚Äôt assumed either way. You seem to be support it in theory but reluctant due to implementation worries.

488768776117035000,Mon Jul 14 19:35:31 +0000 2014,@VassB Ideally, I‚Äôd say combine the two. The psych/sociological research into early brain development is conclusive in terms of benefits.
488768400047341600,Mon Jul 14 19:34:02 +0000 2014,@VassB And, the Tories‚Äô $100/mo. cheque is a joke. Spoke to a mother last week who was paying $1,500/mo for quality care. That‚Äôs not just.
488768233646719000,Mon Jul 14 19:33:22 +0000 2014,@VassB Both gov‚Äôts should devote resources to it. Right now, we‚Äôre at 0.3% of GDP while we should be at 1%.

488765741823303700,Mon Jul 14 19:23:28 +0000 2014,@VassB And, as mentioned before, our int‚Äôl standing is abysmal. Spending 1/3 of what the OECD recommends. A clear indicator for doubling $
