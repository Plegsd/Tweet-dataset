564197184430567400,Sat Feb 07 23:01:05 +0000 2015,@ULoB_PornDoc my goal is not to fix the stigma of porn. It's to draw attention to an unregulated part of the industry which exploits teens.

562743541508878340,Tue Feb 03 22:44:50 +0000 2015,@CineKink yes, agreed. I think ultimately, we all want the same thing. Choice &amp;  equality &amp;  GENUINE empowerment for women in any industry.

562711834374176800,Tue Feb 03 20:38:50 +0000 2015,@kittystryker my intention is not to shame but to share stories. yes, every industry deserves equal respect, protection &amp; worker's rights.

562709758365696000,Tue Feb 03 20:30:35 +0000 2015,@CineKink a lot of loopholes in the wild west of porn industry that seem to be exploited.  Really want to open up a dialogue about this.
562709378126843900,Tue Feb 03 20:29:05 +0000 2015,@CineKink many stories to be told from porn world. I'm pro-sex, anti-exploitation. Good experiences don't negate bad ones. &amp; vice versa.
562708991013560300,Tue Feb 03 20:27:32 +0000 2015,@kittystryker of course porn movies, Hollywood movies, anything that depends on performances, is going to be performative. It's axiomatic.
562708476858994700,Tue Feb 03 20:25:30 +0000 2015,@kittystryker my gripe is that SOCIO-CULTURALLY, we seem more interested in performative "sexuality" than actual sexual pleasure for women.

506896553282666500,Tue Sep 02 20:08:50 +0000 2014,IMHO, the most salient issue in the next decade will be privacy. EVERYONE'S: Man, woman, celeb, not celeb. No question about that...
506890019957932000,Tue Sep 02 19:42:52 +0000 2014,.@bennyredmondy just bc you don't care doesn't mean it isn't important. If u didn't look at pics &amp; you don't care, then ur all good, right?
506885201608585200,Tue Sep 02 19:23:44 +0000 2014,.@bennyredmondy maybe you looked at these pics and feel defensive about your "right" to do so? Internet can distance us from accountability
506877201137299460,Tue Sep 02 18:51:56 +0000 2014,@bennyredmondy did you read the article?  Seen any leaked pics of naked celeb men recently? There is really nothing hilarious about this.
506870884863582200,Tue Sep 02 18:26:50 +0000 2014,YES TO THIS: http://t.co/G5Zmb80KWw  Don't look at those photos.  Don't perpetuate the war on women's privacy.  This is just the beginning.
