536971240976560100,Mon Nov 24 19:54:54 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify fortunately both ideas have considerable advantages to unit sales!
536971101809557500,Mon Nov 24 19:54:21 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify the industry is not familiar w per listener monetization. Jumping from units to streams hard enough.
536970560362647550,Mon Nov 24 19:52:12 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify the key is that both the existing and alt approaches have strengths and weaknesses.
536970301263720450,Mon Nov 24 19:51:10 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify the simple economics of the current model are already widely misunderstood.
536970225971781600,Mon Nov 24 19:50:52 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify if every listen on the service were "worth" a different amount, that would be confusing to everyone.
536969959755092000,Mon Nov 24 19:49:49 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify but that is ok because the simplicity of the model for the consumer and artist overrides.
536969841429590000,Mon Nov 24 19:49:21 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify because they are consuming more. They are effectively lower margin for Spotify.
536969348380766200,Mon Nov 24 19:47:23 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify not that I don't think there are certain advantages to your proposal :) just on balance.
536969199533305860,Mon Nov 24 19:46:48 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify for now, keeping things as simple as possible feels important for Spotify / streaming.

536968766517551100,Mon Nov 24 19:45:04 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify possibly. But you don't want the most active listeners to be worth the least per play.
536964047904587800,Mon Nov 24 19:26:19 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify you'd see higher per plays on mainstream music, lower on indie.
536963949288120300,Mon Nov 24 19:25:56 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify way fewer listeners consume long tail than mainstream. Opposite would be likely.
536946219046535200,Mon Nov 24 18:15:29 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify And if plays for one artist earn as much as plays for another.
536946142118817800,Mon Nov 24 18:15:10 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify Much cleaner if every artist is equally rewarded by any user listening to their music.
536946015232720900,Mon Nov 24 18:14:40 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify Which would = a financial incentive towards having certain users listen to me vis a vis others.
536945934022615040,Mon Nov 24 18:14:21 +0000 2014,@Sharkyl @JPClassix @aweissman @Spotify The alternative model would make plays from the most active listeners worth less.

473853656551276540,Tue Jun 03 15:48:10 +0000 2014,5/ @pmarca totally possible that tech-driven structural unemployment requires political, not just market, solutions.
473853407577395200,Tue Jun 03 15:47:10 +0000 2014,4/ @pmarca there is also plenty of valuable work that the market doesn't value well. Home work or raising children, for ex.

473853070330175500,Tue Jun 03 15:45:50 +0000 2014,2/ @pmarca no less than Keynes predicted a massive "leisure problem" when productivity gains eliminated the need for most jobs.

452598586895634400,Sun Apr 06 00:08:06 +0000 2014,@pmarca True dat. It is a genuine prob that most of electorate does not understand what's being voted upon, myself included.
452598399267655700,Sun Apr 06 00:07:21 +0000 2014,@pmarca This is really radical, and tricky given our terrible past with voting tests, but I actually think specific voting tests make sense.
452598243776397300,Sun Apr 06 00:06:44 +0000 2014,@pmarca I would generalize this and say that all of us need to be protected from any of us who don't know the facts of reality.

452597721677844500,Sun Apr 06 00:04:40 +0000 2014,@pmarca It is, but I believe it is largely symptomatic of a learned sense of irrelevance in the wider political-economy.

452536839241363460,Sat Apr 05 20:02:44 +0000 2014,@pmarca This is why we need, among other things, a voting holiday. Crazy that we don't have one.

407223531907211260,Sun Dec 01 19:03:50 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot my perception is biased just as yours is. All that matters is the underlying truth, however.

407208353274658800,Sun Dec 01 18:03:31 +0000 2013,Race is one of the stupidest things people have ever invented.
407208047359295500,Sun Dec 01 18:02:18 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot that's my real life. Both Max and I have been in interracial relationships for the past 6 years.
407055460131303400,Sun Dec 01 07:55:59 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot That was not how the script was written, directed, or performed. The actresses would confirm it.
407055174599856100,Sun Dec 01 07:54:51 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot But this is so expected of pop and rap videos these days that it never generates an outcry.
407055070266544100,Sun Dec 01 07:54:26 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot Also, it seems obvious to me that hundreds of music videos are far more objectifying of women, and esp black women, than ours.
407054641386381300,Sun Dec 01 07:52:43 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot Ultimately, I feel the art succeeded in creating a conversation about gender, race, and sexuality. Not much pop music does that.
407054247511851000,Sun Dec 01 07:51:09 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot That is a subjective view. The intention was for her to be truly in control at the end. And having been there...she was.
407048197366771700,Sun Dec 01 07:27:07 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot The video and song were meant to subvert and confuse racial, gender, and sexual orientation categories. Purposefully ambiguous.
407047727281745900,Sun Dec 01 07:25:15 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot I think that view is obsessed with oppression and is an infinitely recursive trap.
407040828410851300,Sun Dec 01 06:57:50 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot The second half of the video is a power reversal where she takes control.
407025410312925200,Sun Dec 01 05:56:34 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot I think that's a simplistic interpretation. The black character was totally self-possessed and agentive.

406680552700252160,Sat Nov 30 07:06:14 +0000 2013,@IamAgriot I see all people as fully human. Celebrating beauty and sexuality is different than objectifying.
