377611849254309900,Wed Sep 11 01:57:35 +0000 2013,Presidents moral case for action was passionate/compelling. However, the national security consequences were vague, left a lot on the table.

375298224291995650,Wed Sep 04 16:44:04 +0000 2013,A limited military strike -- which is not part of an overall strategy -- can do more harm than good.
375298023640662000,Wed Sep 04 16:43:16 +0000 2013,Limited military action can be effective.  Boots on the ground and an open-ended engagement are not required.
375297754991308800,Wed Sep 04 16:42:12 +0000 2013,I want to ensure it has intended effect of degrading Assads’ capabilities. A military strike cannot be ‘check-the-box’ action.
375297551664029700,Wed Sep 04 16:41:23 +0000 2013,I hope we can find some accommodation to ensure military action is effective, limited, and contains a ‘follow-on’ strategy.

374621659304820740,Mon Sep 02 19:55:38 +0000 2013,Now is the time for Pres. Obama to reshape public opinion. Why does Syria matter? American people won't/don't follow an uncertain trumpet.
374617707066716160,Mon Sep 02 19:39:56 +0000 2013,Syria is a cancer that is growing in the region. And over the past 2 years Pres. Obama has allowed the situation There to become a debacle.
374616719178096640,Mon Sep 02 19:36:00 +0000 2013,If we don't get Syria right, good luck in convincing the Iranians to change their behavior and their drive for nuclear weapons.

325621353447309300,Sat Apr 20 14:45:55 +0000 2013,A decision to NOT read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests.
325621229635649540,Sat Apr 20 14:45:25 +0000 2013,Under the Law of War, suspect must be humanely treated, consistent w/ the Detainee Treatment Act, domestic law, and the Geneva Conventions.
325621058575155200,Sat Apr 20 14:44:44 +0000 2013,As to any future trial, if this suspect is an American citizen, he is NOT subject to military commission trial. #Boston
325620634963017700,Sat Apr 20 14:43:03 +0000 2013,An enemy combatant is entitled to a habeas hearing before a federal judge with appointment of a counsel. Usually, w/in 30 days of capture.

325419654153633800,Sat Apr 20 01:24:26 +0000 2013,The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.

264084068419907600,Thu Nov 01 19:18:43 +0000 2012,What happened in #Benghazi was a failure of leadership by President Obama.
264075589072343040,Thu Nov 01 18:45:01 +0000 2012,President Obama was AWOL when it came to protecting our folks in #Benghazi, Libya.

263260923794427900,Tue Oct 30 12:47:50 +0000 2012,If #Benghazi had happened on President Bush's watch, there would have been a totally different response by the mainstream media.

260777837626265600,Tue Oct 23 16:20:56 +0000 2012,Based upon what we already know, this episode fits squarely into the realm of an act of terrorism.
260777551222419460,Tue Oct 23 16:19:47 +0000 2012,Difference in characterization b/w workplace violence &amp; act of terrorism is meaningful - in a variety of ways - to the victims and families.

258265302482165760,Tue Oct 16 17:57:01 +0000 2012,Mr. President, were you informed of these attacks on our Libyan consulate? If not, why not?
258264797643173900,Tue Oct 16 17:55:00 +0000 2012,This attack was preceded by an earlier IED attack against the Consulate in April 2012.

145224018138632200,Fri Dec 09 19:31:18 +0000 2011,Given its recent actions, the NLRB as inoperable could be considered progress.
145223606631280640,Fri Dec 09 19:29:40 +0000 2011,I will continue to block all nominations to the NLRB until we get satisfactory answers regarding their role in this entire saga.
145223395083157500,Fri Dec 09 19:28:50 +0000 2011,There are disturbing questions about possible collaboration between the Machinists union and the NLRB against Boeing.
145223176815783940,Fri Dec 09 19:27:58 +0000 2011,I’m glad the ridiculous complaint against Boeing has gone away, but........
145222785231364100,Fri Dec 09 19:26:24 +0000 2011,A congressional investigation to answer questions about the NLRBs role, attitude, and relationship with the parties is definitely warranted.
145222341335580670,Fri Dec 09 19:24:38 +0000 2011,I find the whole episode between the Machinists union and the NLRB against Boeing highly suspicious.
145222037605072900,Fri Dec 09 19:23:26 +0000 2011,It would be completely unacceptable for the NLRB, which is supposed to be an independent arbiter, to be used and help in a union’s bidding.
145221324288180220,Fri Dec 09 19:20:36 +0000 2011,I have real concerns the NLRB complaint was used as a negotiating tool against Boeing.
145216967706558460,Fri Dec 09 19:03:17 +0000 2011,However, it’s hard to celebrate an event (NLRB complaint against Boeing SC) which never should have happened.
