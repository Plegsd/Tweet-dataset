777455216195100700,Sun Sep 18 10:32:22 +0000 2016,@bhargavsoni After today I have completely boycotted them too @jetairways
777454706603937800,Sun Sep 18 10:30:21 +0000 2016,And to top it off, no instructions given in the beginning of the flight about how to use your life jacket and safety exits. Wow! @jetairways
777454502609727500,Sun Sep 18 10:29:32 +0000 2016,The pilot TELLS us he knew the AC isn't working, and he still decided to go ahead with the flight. What world are you living in??@jetairways
777454129505378300,Sun Sep 18 10:28:03 +0000 2016,@jetairways No bro, you can't just be 'concerned'. How do you let a flight take off when you know the AC isn't working? HOW?
777452418103595000,Sun Sep 18 10:21:15 +0000 2016,On top of that you have your staff throwing people into the aircraft in the worst way possible. Insanity at its peak @jetairways
777451897863098400,Sun Sep 18 10:19:11 +0000 2016,You have a criminal on our flight and you're risking lives of the civilians. No ventilation, not enough oxygen. Boycott @jetairways
777451748784955400,Sun Sep 18 10:18:35 +0000 2016,And why is all this happening?Because Asaram Bapu is on the flight and the airconditioning doesn't suit him. Are you kidding me? @jetairways

777451081731223600,Sun Sep 18 10:15:56 +0000 2016,The pilot tells us he knew the AC wasn't working in the previous flight, but he still decided to fly the passengers. @jetairways
777450879544811500,Sun Sep 18 10:15:08 +0000 2016,Claustrophobic for 1 hour 15 mins because there's no ventilation whatsoever, let alone the AC. Risking lives of your passengers @jetairways

621915709879115800,Fri Jul 17 05:33:54 +0000 2015,@Uber_HYD Hence, for a journey of let's say 15 kms, I spent for a journey of 25 kms. How would you justify the driver's behaviour?
