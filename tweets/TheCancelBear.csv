912337879992545300,Mon Sep 25 15:27:55 +0000 2017,@nAuntie That too.
912335935722999800,Mon Sep 25 15:20:12 +0000 2017,@Booch535 Predictions begin next week. But probably not yet.
912331453056340000,Mon Sep 25 15:02:23 +0000 2017,Claws: sharpened. Sense of smell: acute. Reflexes: fast.  It’s hunting season.
911033021809164300,Fri Sep 22 01:02:53 +0000 2017,@Mark_Da_Silva_ “Speechless” starts Season 2 next week. The Bear doesn’t closely track summer shows. Hibernation and all.
910937684725690400,Thu Sep 21 18:44:03 +0000 2017,@UltimoLeo Highly unlikely it will get an early hook. Only 8 episodes w/big investment upfront. Whether it keeps go… https://t.co/tVHkLxVUdo
910918043160674300,Thu Sep 21 17:26:00 +0000 2017,@K0jiii The Bear never tells people to stop watching; only predicts when shows themselves will stop. Your time is your own.
910916838367879200,Thu Sep 21 17:21:12 +0000 2017,@SamMawPT Fair play to you.
910916105098678300,Thu Sep 21 17:18:18 +0000 2017,@robotictom Thank you sir, but your profile pic is making the Bear even hungrier.
910915785496973300,Thu Sep 21 17:17:01 +0000 2017,There may be slight tweaks to the Renew/Cancel formula as well. TBD while the Bear crunches some numbers.
910915021026324500,Thu Sep 21 17:13:59 +0000 2017,Meantime still digesting “Downward Dog” and the last bit of “24: Legacy.” That should tide the Bear over.
910914488307765200,Thu Sep 21 17:11:52 +0000 2017,Annual review of the Third Season Rule and shows affected by it coming early next week. Predictions begin Oct. 3.
910914165698687000,Thu Sep 21 17:10:35 +0000 2017,Greetings. The calendar says fall starts tomorrow, but the Bear is awake and hungry.
905524894410174500,Wed Sep 06 20:15:33 +0000 2017,@jondlloyd Most likely no predictions till after the first full week of the season.

900032661237923800,Tue Aug 22 16:31:22 +0000 2017,@AraWagco Sometimes the Bear likes to snack in silence.

872836112452124700,Thu Jun 08 15:22:00 +0000 2017,One last meal before falling back into hibernation. Get over here, “24: Legacy.” #chomp #zzzz
869606177038110700,Tue May 30 17:27:23 +0000 2017,The Bear will awaken briefly if and when “24: Legacy” gets an up or down vote. Till the fall, then. Cheers.
869605245483143200,Tue May 30 17:23:41 +0000 2017,The Bear had a better record this season than last. Most misses had to do with network/studio ownership, which may get more weight next year
869605072862421000,Tue May 30 17:23:00 +0000 2017,The Bear is heading into hibernation, but before he goes, a look back at this season’s predictions: https://t.co/syw13PUMVK
868210168135376900,Fri May 26 21:00:09 +0000 2017,Honestly, the Bear has some end-of-season-itis, in addition to being quite full. So predictions wrap-up after the long weekend. Apologies.
867047824743125000,Tue May 23 16:01:25 +0000 2017,The Bear wasn’t expecting a late meal of “Chicago Justice” but will take it. With a side of cheese fries. #chomp
866314432351268900,Sun May 21 15:27:10 +0000 2017,@jeffastrof @trialanderror The Bear is patient.

865615352188817400,Fri May 19 17:09:16 +0000 2017,@AustinHighsmith It’s definitely on the card. The Bear had “Last Man” as a likely renewal but knows that in network… https://t.co/iqS8t85g84
864880388195459100,Wed May 17 16:28:47 +0000 2017,Last course of the week (probably): “Training Day” and “Ransom.” #chomp #huntingseason
864697903511732200,Wed May 17 04:23:40 +0000 2017,@laurabwise A few days ago now. Honestly the meals kind of blur together this time of year.
864313713515524100,Tue May 16 02:57:02 +0000 2017,“Quantico” escapes the Bear, with the dubious distinction of being the lowest-rated returning show on ABC next season. The Bear is patient.
864154237839781900,Mon May 15 16:23:20 +0000 2017,Urp. The Bear’s starting to get full. But, OK, maybe just a little “Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders” as a pre-lunch appetizer. #chomp
864114487594545200,Mon May 15 13:45:22 +0000 2017,The Bear has had a place reserved for “Scream Queens” for months now. Like with a good steak or bottle of wine, aging can be good. #chomp
863970703435018200,Mon May 15 04:14:02 +0000 2017,@mxedtr Plenty to eat this week. The Bear will not go hungry.
863968179005141000,Mon May 15 04:04:00 +0000 2017,“Code Black” somehow escapes the Bear again. But the Bear is patient.
863573473708343300,Sun May 14 01:55:35 +0000 2017,@1stPrtyGmr Money talks.
863468338294509600,Sat May 13 18:57:48 +0000 2017,@DrBravo2 So it would appear. Interesting times we live in.
863203737996841000,Sat May 13 01:26:23 +0000 2017,The Bear didn’t think “2 Broke Girls” would be canceled. It is. Will eat up anyway, with a side of cupcakes. #chomp
863166069103620100,Fri May 12 22:56:42 +0000 2017,@len_massaar True. Still feeling a little bit full from yesterday tbh.
863160138739441700,Fri May 12 22:33:08 +0000 2017,@VariousCrap It does happen every now and then. The Bear is only ursine.

862827695121608700,Fri May 12 00:32:07 +0000 2017,@4evaOutlander It was, this year. That tweet is from a year ago.
862794146217635800,Thu May 11 22:18:49 +0000 2017,@cooljimnews The Bear thanks you for reading.
862792291538399200,Thu May 11 22:11:26 +0000 2017,@jcwilmeth Or, much more likely, its price tag was going to be more than ABC wanted to pay next season.
862791915783299100,Thu May 11 22:09:57 +0000 2017,@MatPDouglas May is always good #huntingseason.
862789432272973800,Thu May 11 22:00:05 +0000 2017,So either NBC is running 4 hours of “This Is Us” a week next season or the Bear is going to get *very* fat on peacock a year from now.
862767421081374700,Thu May 11 20:32:37 +0000 2017,Never expected to see “The Goldbergs” at the Bear’s table this season. Tip of the paw for the 2-season pickup.
862726742162780200,Thu May 11 17:50:58 +0000 2017,The Bear had “Son of Zorn” juuust on right side of the bubble. “APB” and “Making History” long doomed. #chomp #huntingseason
862516682094506000,Thu May 11 03:56:16 +0000 2017,Honestly, the Bear didn’t expect to be snacking on “Last Man Standing” but such is #huntingseason. Just an appetizer for what’s coming.
862497644597432300,Thu May 11 02:40:37 +0000 2017,@kceezie Safe to say that *won’t* be the hot trend again anytime soon.
862436146353250300,Wed May 10 22:36:15 +0000 2017,If the Bear didn’t know better, he’d think NBC was renewing/canceling stuff just to mess with his average. “Blindspot” in, “Timeless” out.
862159042038333400,Wed May 10 04:15:08 +0000 2017,Ahem. It's next year. #chomp #SleepyHollow https://t.co/E7mKecg3Cy
862047648584478700,Tue May 09 20:52:30 +0000 2017,@DrJ_EFC_FAN There can be room for both, it would seem. “Taken” is 16 episodes and needs a new showrunner, so probably not back in fall.
862046402075086800,Tue May 09 20:47:32 +0000 2017,@DrBravo2 Not too often, but the Bear is only ursine, after all.
862046211884404700,Tue May 09 20:46:47 +0000 2017,@KalliopePL If you click that link you can see for yourself.
862044545634226200,Tue May 09 20:40:10 +0000 2017,“Taken” is the first incorrect prediction for the Bear so far this season. So it goes.

861784644567670800,Tue May 09 03:27:25 +0000 2017,@RhodeToLove Not likely. Multiple prior reports of plans to pare down the cast should it go another year, which it probably will.

859441517236244500,Tue May 02 16:16:40 +0000 2017,@ncbjd It ended its season a month or so ago. No official word one way or the other yet.
859440656829296600,Tue May 02 16:13:14 +0000 2017,@ncbjd The Bear thought “I didn’t know that was still on” jokes were canceled even longer ago.

840295809866424300,Fri Mar 10 20:18:27 +0000 2017,There’s a reason the Bear makes a presumption of renewal for CW shows. Paw tip to “The 100,” which was tabbed as likely pickup.
839232002276610000,Tue Mar 07 21:51:16 +0000 2017,@pasteljupiter None right now. “Frequency” and “No Tomorrow” have finished their seasons.
839231316352725000,Tue Mar 07 21:48:32 +0000 2017,@freckledblake Not really. “Frequency”/“No Tomorrow” would be reaches regardless. “The 100” still seems likely.

834456369243762700,Wed Feb 22 17:34:36 +0000 2017,@PattyPodcast It’s wrong. 6 CW shows this season lower than “The 100” (not 4): “TVD,” “Crazy Ex,” “No Tomorrow,” “Frequency,” “Reign,” “JTV"
834454358637105200,Wed Feb 22 17:26:37 +0000 2017,@PattyPodcast 2nd part first: It’s not second to last on the network - 4  shows lower. And the first part is exactly what the Bear said.
834452576628273200,Wed Feb 22 17:19:32 +0000 2017,@PattyPodcast It’s lower than last season. So is everything else. It's middle of the pack this season, and CW doesn’t cancel shows like that

831236795572576300,Mon Feb 13 20:21:10 +0000 2017,The Bear had “Lucifer” as a tossup for renewal. This is a marginal pickup, and not the last one for broadcasters between now and May.

785901756534272000,Tue Oct 11 17:55:54 +0000 2016,@jnbernstein The CW has smaller reach, is a secondary channel in a number of markets, tolerates lower numbers. Shall the Bear continue?
785893877420990500,Tue Oct 11 17:24:36 +0000 2016,@RDavidOnTheWire It’s in the second year of a 2-year deal, so not a sure thing yet.

785581497747066900,Mon Oct 10 20:43:19 +0000 2016,@KevinInChains It was. It’ll fall below that with the move, but there’s a good deal of wiggle room for it.
785524619138637800,Mon Oct 10 16:57:18 +0000 2016,CW also renews most everything, so short of outright disaster “Supergirl” heads to its new home with a presumption of renewal from the Bear.
785524398279110700,Mon Oct 10 16:56:25 +0000 2016,The CW says it thinks “Supergirl” will be one of its top 3 shows. After last week, that bar is not terribly high.
784770002113081300,Sat Oct 08 14:58:43 +0000 2016,@PeeWeeWinston First one last year wasn’t till November. The Bear is patient.

784096088387006500,Thu Oct 06 18:20:49 +0000 2016,@Your1Backup Pretty much guaranteed renewal. 3rd season + owned by CBS = safe.
783705015273730000,Wed Oct 05 16:26:50 +0000 2016,@GlennRunn Doing fine, thanks for asking.
783697769798049800,Wed Oct 05 15:58:03 +0000 2016,@Dark_Uber Just as there are fans for every show, so are there opposing forces for every show.
783697201830572000,Wed Oct 05 15:55:47 +0000 2016,“No Tomorrow,” on the other hand…   The Bear makes a presumption of renewal for CW shows given recent history but is nonetheless on lookout.
783696570319417300,Wed Oct 05 15:53:17 +0000 2016,3. Come to think of it, the Bear doesn’t hate to disappoint anti-“Flash” folks. It is how it is.
783696265062125600,Wed Oct 05 15:52:04 +0000 2016,2a. Third season + network/studio ownership = near-certain renewal.
783696122833346600,Wed Oct 05 15:51:30 +0000 2016,2. The Third Season Rule is in full effect here. “Flash” is owned by Warner Bros., which also co-owns The CW.
783695832671395800,Wed Oct 05 15:50:21 +0000 2016,1. The CW, a network that barely cancels anything these days, won't cancel its top-rated show, which it almost certainly will still be.
783695584267935700,Wed Oct 05 15:49:22 +0000 2016,The Bear hates to disappoint the anti-“Flash” forces, but it’s going nowhere, for a number of reasons.
783405082742173700,Tue Oct 04 20:35:01 +0000 2016,The Bear believes the particular legal term for those “Conviction” ratings is “ouch.” See you soon.
783400565623566300,Tue Oct 04 20:17:04 +0000 2016,@sfdialways Probably, and not much.
783355647790166000,Tue Oct 04 17:18:35 +0000 2016,@JLM247 Premieres, NFL-affected or not, are typically among the 2 or 3 highest-rated episodes of a season. So.
783349168831991800,Tue Oct 04 16:52:50 +0000 2016,@MSUandUGA Not big. It premiered on time in most of the U.S. this week and didn’t change from early to final ratings.
783348618040193000,Tue Oct 04 16:50:39 +0000 2016,@WOThornton Shows about/set around sports don’t typically do big numbers, and FOX did it no favors w/scheduling.

783319477182042100,Tue Oct 04 14:54:51 +0000 2016,@MattVolk So noted. Fixed and updated.

783273719078658000,Tue Oct 04 11:53:01 +0000 2016,Some statistically minded friends of the Bear have noted a small error in the Renew/Cancel formula for Friday shows. The Bear thanks them.
783132010793492500,Tue Oct 04 02:29:55 +0000 2016,@bansheebabe Probably somewhat as people watch more cable news coverage. Hard to quantify across all of TV though.
783028488047501300,Mon Oct 03 19:38:34 +0000 2016,@hueynym First season did reasonably well, somewhat unexpectedly, and ratings improved late. Long layoff is hurting it.
783018764254052400,Mon Oct 03 18:59:55 +0000 2016,@ddonigan120 The Bear does not hunt summer shows.
782981646022684700,Mon Oct 03 16:32:26 +0000 2016,@bansheebabe Not really, no. Financial incentives aren’t as big for studios/nets in second seasons as in third.
782971214012620800,Mon Oct 03 15:50:58 +0000 2016,@AsToldByThomas To an extent, but it’s likely FOX will let it play out its run through the fall.
782970143412359200,Mon Oct 03 15:46:43 +0000 2016,“The Sopranos” could get away with being off the air for a year-plus. “Secrets and Lies,” not so much.
781882984613879800,Fri Sep 30 15:46:44 +0000 2016,So “Notorious” held in week 2. The Bear is patient.

780861818713497600,Tue Sep 27 20:08:59 +0000 2016,@TVPredictor Prefer to take a cautious approach for middle-of-the-pack shows when the sample is so small.
780807479823179800,Tue Sep 27 16:33:04 +0000 2016,@ClaireKDublin Sure thing. It premieres Oct. 11 here.
780804382556205000,Tue Sep 27 16:20:46 +0000 2016,@ClaireKDublin Because it hasn’t premiered yet. No ratings to index.
780793031079243800,Tue Sep 27 15:35:39 +0000 2016,The Bear is also confidently predicting that “Presidential Debates” will return as a limited series in 2020.

780782849104359400,Tue Sep 27 14:55:12 +0000 2016,@DSGNTD_PLYR The Bear doesn’t do political statements. The Bear is just about numbers.

779349720627941400,Fri Sep 23 16:00:27 +0000 2016,@phatmanshortman The Bear cares not for politics. But “Notorious” has potential to do more collateral damage to ABC than “Pitch” does to FOX
779345130650075100,Fri Sep 23 15:42:13 +0000 2016,ABC likely to have less patience w/“Notorious” than FOX will w/“Pitch.” Table being set.

778621441528860700,Wed Sep 21 15:46:32 +0000 2016,Four new series premieres, four pretty good starts in the ratings. The Bear may be dining on some more seasoned fare this year.

732934676495536100,Wed May 18 14:03:38 +0000 2016,@TVMaury If they’d wanted to renew it, they would’ve just renewed it rather than seeing if someone else wanted it.
732931853577912300,Wed May 18 13:52:25 +0000 2016,Not taking a bite of “Limitless” just yet. But regardless of what CBS says, it’s warming in the oven.
732614869912932400,Tue May 17 16:52:50 +0000 2016,@everybetty Final prediction last week was that it would be renewed. Looking like that may be incorrect.

649662326539292700,Thu Oct 01 19:09:03 +0000 2015,The Bear was tending to some cubs earlier today. But there is not much to remark upon “Code Black’s” unremarkable start.
649662097316405200,Thu Oct 01 19:08:08 +0000 2015,@AngelaC16837914 So far, “Rosewood” is performing somewhat better. Most of FOX is a mishmash in the mid-1s.

649270558862012400,Wed Sep 30 17:12:18 +0000 2015,“Limitless” had pretty good week 2 retention. The Bear suspects other CBS shows may be easier to catch.
648891076934271000,Tue Sep 29 16:04:23 +0000 2015,Don’t get too excited yet, “Castle” fans. Increase last night due at least in part to NFL pre-emption.
648888722189062100,Tue Sep 29 15:55:01 +0000 2015,@Adelaide0916 It’s a long season. And remember: Shows only need outrun the others on their network to avoid the Bear.

593438644574105600,Wed Apr 29 15:36:13 +0000 2015,#Undateable &amp; #OneBigHappy ratings hit season lows
593438497890967600,Wed Apr 29 15:35:38 +0000 2015,For those keeping score at home, #NCIS, #TheVoice &amp; #AgentsOfSHIELD ratings hit series lows
593435873800159200,Wed Apr 29 15:25:12 +0000 2015,Never a good sign when a show (#TheMysteriesOfLaura) gets replaced with a repeat of a *different* show.
593435579431301100,Wed Apr 29 15:24:02 +0000 2015,@FonderofRiddles no, AC ratings were in a much higher rated part of the season
593435505192083500,Wed Apr 29 15:23:44 +0000 2015,What’s on the #bearchow menu tonight? With #bearchow #TheMysteriesOfLaura pre-empted for a CF repeat, nothing.

593434439998287900,Wed Apr 29 15:19:30 +0000 2015,#AgentsOfSHIELD ratings (1.4 A18-49) back to their lows, but it’s out of the bear’s reach this season
593434048044732400,Wed Apr 29 15:17:57 +0000 2015,#iZombie ratings (0.7 A18-49) rise, even if pre-emption boosted, the bear’s not catching it this season
593433709459574800,Wed Apr 29 15:16:36 +0000 2015,#Undateable ratings (1.2 A18-49) go low, but the bear still thinks it escapes him
593433549514014700,Wed Apr 29 15:15:58 +0000 2015,Random 20/20 ratings (1.4 A18-49) far better than the #bearchow #Forever it pre-empted
593433390013030400,Wed Apr 29 15:15:20 +0000 2015,#OneBigHappy ratings (0.9 A18-49) go fractional, #bearchow potential at maximum already
593433095484801000,Wed Apr 29 15:14:10 +0000 2015,#WeirdLoners ratings (0.6 A18-49) stay embarrassing, soon it will end in #bearchow
