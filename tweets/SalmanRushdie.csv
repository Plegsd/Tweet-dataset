201415507214213120,Sat May 12 20:56:13 +0000 2012,I am not a low-boat kind of guy, @Shteyngart. My son says if I go to his birthday he will buy me a plane when he's a rockstar. Better offer.
201395765501898750,Sat May 12 19:37:46 +0000 2012,@Shteyngart How big is your yacht? I wouldn't want to be on some small sausage dog of a yacht. I prefer the Great Dane type of vessel.
201385298687565820,Sat May 12 18:56:11 +0000 2012,@Shteyngart I have no May plans except for my son's birthday but I will cancel that immediately.

199967613646929920,Tue May 08 21:02:48 +0000 2012,A little premature with the SR engraving, @Shteyngart. Maybe you should now propose to Seth Rogen.
199966271851339780,Tue May 08 20:57:29 +0000 2012,@Shteyngart I'm sorry. I guess you're just not the girl for me. Now if you had read Gogol - but, forget it. Pico Iyer, you can have him.
199964075067850750,Tue May 08 20:48:45 +0000 2012,@Shteyngart did you bring roses? was there a ring? I don't think so. Next time, try a little kneeling. It really helps. Just a tip.
