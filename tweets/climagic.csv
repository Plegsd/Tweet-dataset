806538479098351600,Wed Dec 07 16:38:52 +0000 2016,@chrisheithoff Its specifically for bypassing aliases. So if you have an alias for cd (ie. alias cd='cd -P'), \cd will bypass that alias.

806217796229140500,Tue Dec 06 19:24:36 +0000 2016,@nixcraft Depends on what you want I guess. If you just want a pid, then pgrep is great.
