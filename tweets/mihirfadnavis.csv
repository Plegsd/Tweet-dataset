910032929685782500,Tue Sep 19 06:48:52 +0000 2017,@NotSoSnob You mean people have finally decided not to pay to watch shitty movies? Shocking behaviour.

907663721455132700,Tue Sep 12 17:54:29 +0000 2017,JJ Abrams is a decent replacement but I would have loved to see Brad Bird directing Episode 9.

907528798362579000,Tue Sep 12 08:58:21 +0000 2017,@SethShruti It made sense thematically, but tonally it could have been handled better I think.
907528064170647600,Tue Sep 12 08:55:26 +0000 2017,@SethShruti Good show but when that dance started in the finale I couldn’t stop laughing.

900416840278691800,Wed Aug 23 17:57:58 +0000 2017,@MakkadManav I guess. Because nothing consequential happened.
900416488397574100,Wed Aug 23 17:56:34 +0000 2017,Every time the side characters appeared in Defenders - Foggy, Coleen, Misty, Trish, Karen, Clair - I wished Punisher showed up and shot them
900415817262788600,Wed Aug 23 17:53:54 +0000 2017,@MakkadManav DD S2 is actually very good.
900415295633993700,Wed Aug 23 17:51:50 +0000 2017,Many similarities between Defenders &amp; BvS. Dour look, boring action, poor character dynamics, lame team up, awful villain, false end death.
900414380872958000,Wed Aug 23 17:48:11 +0000 2017,The trailer for The Defenders featured Nirvana’s ‘Come as you are’. Looked fuckin cool. The actual show is a dour and tiresome piece of shit
900401226302574600,Wed Aug 23 16:55:55 +0000 2017,@bisprad 60k is too expensive.
900275857259933700,Wed Aug 23 08:37:45 +0000 2017,@Airtel_Presence As you can see there is no improvement at all. Pls get this fixed asap because it’s getting really frustrating now. Thanks.

900074172008812500,Tue Aug 22 19:16:19 +0000 2017,@srizzler I’ll take Fury Road in a pen drive. Are the rear speaker cables long enough?
900073316341428200,Tue Aug 22 19:12:55 +0000 2017,@srizzler Ok. Looks like my final choice is going to be between the Onkyo 3800 and the Yamaha 2910. Will check both in showroom.
900069596216143900,Tue Aug 22 18:58:08 +0000 2017,@srizzler Any particular reason how the Onkyo beats the Yamaha?
900066724170670100,Tue Aug 22 18:46:44 +0000 2017,@srizzler Which model and how does it compare to the Yamaha?

898195888123891700,Thu Aug 17 14:52:42 +0000 2017,@UrbanLadder Alternatively, if you could send the 2.5’ shelves in the same order it’s fine.
