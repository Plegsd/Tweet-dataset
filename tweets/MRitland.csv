567149520568320000,Mon Feb 16 02:32:37 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain why do you think they use toys? BECAUSE THEY ARE PREY DRIVEN TO CHASE IT.
567147646968557600,Mon Feb 16 02:25:10 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain dogs bred for high genetic prey drive i.e police dogs for detection work couldn't be further from that
567142535357669400,Mon Feb 16 02:04:52 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain but most of the ones I deal with are.
567142473542008800,Mon Feb 16 02:04:37 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain a dog so driven to chase a prey object that nothing reward wise you can offer is more enticing. Again few dogs are like this
567141866265530400,Mon Feb 16 02:02:12 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain marker training and body language is the backbone to communicating with a dog in my "so called" trainer opinion
567141654457376800,Mon Feb 16 02:01:22 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain I believe most people cause pain stress and fear without realizing it. I believe in using as many tools as possible to achieve

567139120359555100,Mon Feb 16 01:51:17 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain correctly or incorrectly. To say "I don't believe in using X" says to me you don't know how to properly utilize that tool
567138806000672800,Mon Feb 16 01:50:02 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain remember reward and punishment is in the eye of the beholder - just like with people. All equipment are tools that can be used
567138585048928260,Mon Feb 16 01:49:10 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain I believe in predominant +R learning for sure, but I also think again every dog is different and some need +p
567136061294276600,Mon Feb 16 01:39:08 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain we agree on that- and that's my point is that every dog is different and making that blanket statement is a hard way to start
567133454626598900,Mon Feb 16 01:28:47 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain I think every dog/handler is different and there is no blanket answer. It's a starting point that I think gets over complicated
567129902126600200,Mon Feb 16 01:14:40 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain it's simple math. Adding and subtracting reinforcement/punishment to get desired results.
567129352228196350,Mon Feb 16 01:12:28 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain http://t.co/Tzf9C7vGFv
567127398613671940,Mon Feb 16 01:04:43 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain you are incorrect - positive and negative mean adding and subtracting. For both reinforcement and punishment -Not bad and good
567125883245183000,Mon Feb 16 00:58:41 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain and -R completely depends on what the R is. Blanket statements like that show inflexibility in my view
567123765511737340,Mon Feb 16 00:50:17 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain negative reinforcement is withholding the reward. That was in response to your "not jumping up and getting loved or get nothing
567121742133338100,Mon Feb 16 00:42:14 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain I can only say the same thing so many times- visual cue is what, reinforcing is why.
567121085116600300,Mon Feb 16 00:39:37 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain are you actually reading anything I'm posting?
567117285689524200,Mon Feb 16 00:24:32 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain again- making my point. The visual cue you speak of doesn't communicate any of that. It's simply the pretext
567116255711076350,Mon Feb 16 00:20:26 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain you're making my point. Why being the "fun" is the positive reinforcement. Not the visual cue you give the dog
567115405487927300,Mon Feb 16 00:17:03 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain thought about it - and there's not a behavior a dog can do that you can't extinguish through negative reinforcement
567115126583480300,Mon Feb 16 00:15:57 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain appear to have disappeared? What does disappear mean? To not appear - so if a dog doesn't do it then it's irrelevant if he
567114684084416500,Mon Feb 16 00:14:11 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain point frame of reference for a beginner to understand. Have you actually read the book or just listened to one interview?
567114527158706200,Mon Feb 16 00:13:34 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain its on a book on how to start to train. So me stating an over simplification of how we comm vs. how dogs comm is a starting
567114218684420100,Mon Feb 16 00:12:20 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain agreed- but that's still not the why. You've taught what it means but not why they are supposed to. And in ref to the interview
567111177512054800,Mon Feb 16 00:00:15 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain to test that theory - stop regarding the dog after the cue and watch behavior disappear. If it was why- it wouldn't
567110970971922400,Sun Feb 15 23:59:26 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain I understand that- but a cue means only what. Not why. Reward based on what motivates the dog is not part of that equation.
567109049942933500,Sun Feb 15 23:51:48 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain ok-but your visual cue doesn't tell the dog why - it simply says "to" - reward or punishment is the why
567107762320994300,Sun Feb 15 23:46:41 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain I disagree 100%. I always prefer dog offering behavior on its own and it being marked and reinforced. Self discovery &gt; cueing
567107112644268000,Sun Feb 15 23:44:06 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain there's a big difference between a "man" and adult male
567106246092660740,Sun Feb 15 23:40:40 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain but to that point - exactly.  Visual cues don't communicate a reason as to why do it now instead of later. Reinforcement does
567105271906852860,Sun Feb 15 23:36:47 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain A "man" doesn't need to be asked
567104052387778560,Sun Feb 15 23:31:57 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain from my perspective of what I've seen its a humans lack of understanding how to communicate what we want. Hence my wording
567100436688023550,Sun Feb 15 23:17:34 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain my point was simply that they learn very differently than we do. Trying to get humans to see the world from dog perspective
567092551107092500,Sun Feb 15 22:46:14 +0000 2015,@Lokota_Rain it's in comparison to the other senses in which they use to communicate - in relation to the contrast in how we communicate
