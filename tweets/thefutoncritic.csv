341972656184229900,Tue Jun 04 17:40:09 +0000 2013,#Delirium: busted pilot; "Reef Madness"-esque vibe comes off as silly; leads never sell the central romance; never squares circle about cure
341972139462770700,Tue Jun 04 17:38:06 +0000 2013,#OnceWonderland: for better/worse just doesn't feel any different from parent show; Lowe has charms; some inside baseball if new to the show
341971791876616200,Tue Jun 04 17:36:43 +0000 2013,#Believe: vague mythology, backstory gets frustrating; weird fight sequences; that said, actually enjoy leads, "Highway to Heaven" premise
341971424325541900,Tue Jun 04 17:35:15 +0000 2013,#Reckless: awkwardly plotted, executed; case of the week plays as afterthought; never quite gets a handle on what it wants to be; odd pickup
341971131600883700,Tue Jun 04 17:34:05 +0000 2013,#Lucky7: relentlessly dreary for a show about having something extraordinary happen; very few likable characters; just didn't connect to it
341970843477348350,Tue Jun 04 17:32:57 +0000 2013,#Ironside: just a solid, well-made procedural; Underwood as usual is great; supporting cast is amusingly colorful; Ironside INO but so be it
341970523292569600,Tue Jun 04 17:31:40 +0000 2013,#Resurrection: slow burn is an understatement; pinhole view of "big event" nice change of pace; doesn't seem in any rush to give answers
341970093846179840,Tue Jun 04 17:29:58 +0000 2013,#TheGoldbergs: really wanted to like but just feels flat; "real life" nods only compound the disappointment; maybe will turn into something
341969817777098750,Tue Jun 04 17:28:52 +0000 2013,#KillerWomen: Helfer is all sorts of great, has unexpected vulnerability; solid, twisty opening case; supporting cast doesn't get to do much
341969453388550140,Tue Jun 04 17:27:25 +0000 2013,Twitter apparently ate these so apologies for the repost...
339792250039062500,Wed May 29 17:16:00 +0000 2013,#MindGames: Zahn can be a little too much at times; ends up essentially punting on its already tenuous concept; could do w/o closing twist
339792201167011840,Wed May 29 17:15:48 +0000 2013,#BackintheGame: actually a lot of fun; the kids are fantastic; balances heart, funny well; couldn't think of a better #TheMiddle companion
339792149103124500,Wed May 29 17:15:36 +0000 2013,#Betrayal: plays kind of like PG-13 episode of #RedShoeDiaries; no legit reasons for why leads are unhappy, come off as selfish as a result
339792013669068800,Wed May 29 17:15:03 +0000 2013,#TrophyWife: Akerman seems game for anything; Tsai steals the show as adopted son; wish it was sharper, funnier; plays very "only on TV"
339791945817796600,Wed May 29 17:14:47 +0000 2013,#SuperFunNight: literally the CBS version filmed as single-cam, but with equally unfunny cutaways; genuinely confused why this is on the air
339791888888496100,Wed May 29 17:14:33 +0000 2013,#Intelligence: so great to have Holloway back on TV; some genuinely cool, fun moments; mythology a little muddy; unapologetically "CBS"
339791822996004860,Wed May 29 17:14:18 +0000 2013,#Hostages: feels more thought out than similar fare; still plot holes aplenty; pilot is all setup but closing sizzle promises crazy to come
339791772983119900,Wed May 29 17:14:06 +0000 2013,#TheCrazyOnes: not surprisingly Robin being Robin; Wolk actually a nice surprise here; closing blooper is fun; but show needs to be funnier
339791657480355840,Wed May 29 17:13:38 +0000 2013,#Mom: actually better than you'd think; big, brassy in the usual Lorre way; Faris, Janney fun together; has real POV; may be something here
339791561892192260,Wed May 29 17:13:16 +0000 2013,#TheMillers: you'll either love its fart and old people sex jokes or be out rather quickly; over-the-top Bridges, Martindale steal the show
339791490769371140,Wed May 29 17:12:59 +0000 2013,#WeAreMen: all the usual refrains: wish it was funnier, more distinct; cold open straight from #HappyEndings pilot; cast gives me faith tho
339791410742046700,Wed May 29 17:12:39 +0000 2013,#FriendswithBetterLives: your standard nuts-and-bolts friends sitcom; no standout performances, laughs; ultimately just forgettable stuff
339791358808182800,Wed May 29 17:12:27 +0000 2013,Time for a few more pilots...
339439082558083100,Tue May 28 17:52:38 +0000 2013,@JWalkShrugs Thanks! Yes, full thoughts to come on all of the above soon (including busted pilots). Just sharing some gut reactions.
339437408699432960,Tue May 28 17:45:59 +0000 2013,Will have more written up this afternoon.
339437314205958140,Tue May 28 17:45:36 +0000 2013,#MastersofSex: plays like a movie instead of TV; Sheen, Caplan both daring, bold; simply unlike anything you'll see on TV; all in good ways
339437269142364160,Tue May 28 17:45:26 +0000 2013,#RayDonovan: Schreiber is 50 kinds of awesome; enjoyably pulpy, slick; sexual abuse stuff is unsettling; a lot of plot for just 1 hour of TV
339437175806496800,Tue May 28 17:45:03 +0000 2013,#TomorrowPeople: like #Arrow, emerges fully formed, slick out of the gate; well cast, directed; easily one of this year's strongest pilots
339437106558558200,Tue May 28 17:44:47 +0000 2013,#The100: wish it was grittier, darker; speeds past interesting char development, dynamics; that said, still filled with loads of potential
339437032583602200,Tue May 28 17:44:29 +0000 2013,#StarCrossed: likable in spite of its endless navel gazing; sadly doesn't bother with any metaphors to situation; plenty of silly plot turns
339436967102144500,Tue May 28 17:44:14 +0000 2013,#SleepyHollow: surprisingly entertaining despite being batshit crazy; you'll either drink the Kool-Aid or think it's the dumbest thing ever
339436876614209540,Tue May 28 17:43:52 +0000 2013,#TheBlacklist: kind of bonkers in an entertaining way; Spader enjoyably chews the scenery; plot turns a little obvious; could be fun though
339436783697817600,Tue May 28 17:43:30 +0000 2013,#Crisis: the "everybody has a secret" angle a little too convenient; wish it was more slick, polished; Mulroney a little broad for my taste
339436681323225100,Tue May 28 17:43:05 +0000 2013,#SeanSavestheWorld: unabashedly sitcom-y, for better or worse; filled with "only on TV" plots, char turns; Hayes does all the heavy lifting
339436583461732350,Tue May 28 17:42:42 +0000 2013,#WelcometotheFamily: concept has potential; just wish it was funnier; O'Malley, Chavira have a nice spark; their wives don't get much to do
339436466990112800,Tue May 28 17:42:14 +0000 2013,#MichaelJFoxShow: Fox surprisingly game to poke fun at himself; supporting cast unexpectedly strong, funny; genuine laugh out loud moments
339436345757937660,Tue May 28 17:41:45 +0000 2013,#AboutaBoy: the Cliff's Notes version of the movie; doesn't add anything new; cast is likable but hard to replicate Grant, Hoult, Collette
339436280955932700,Tue May 28 17:41:30 +0000 2013,Holiday weekend allowed for lots of pilot watching...
337274307883454460,Wed May 22 18:30:35 +0000 2013,All for now, hopefully can get through more by the weekend.
337274000608743400,Wed May 22 18:29:22 +0000 2013,#AlmostHuman: easily will win the #Fringe crowd; stunning visuals; Ealy, Urban have very distinct rapport; mythology presents learning curve
337271953595437060,Wed May 22 18:21:14 +0000 2013,#Mixology: "mixed" for sure (rimshot!); high concept aspect doesn't add anything; wish it was funnier; chars just fit types, no standouts
337270914238521340,Wed May 22 18:17:06 +0000 2013,#PrettyMessy (aka Pulling): busted pilot; Slate, Schaal being Slate, Schaal; filled with "only on TV" chars, stakes; just doesn't inspire
337270225722540000,Wed May 22 18:14:22 +0000 2013,#FamilyGuide: more smile funny, than actually funny funny; low stakes plot doesn't inspire; that said, can be darn cute when it wants to be
337269249833832450,Wed May 22 18:10:29 +0000 2013,#Reign: silly, naive view of history; weirdly set in France but nobody has accent; too many actors look alike; don't get the hype
337268838330679300,Wed May 22 18:08:51 +0000 2013,Have time to talk about a few more pilots...
336572699876917250,Mon May 20 20:02:39 +0000 2013,ABC drops #FamilyTools this Wednesday, May 22 in favor of #ModernFamily repeat - http://t.co/zU2rfITC37
336519587736743940,Mon May 20 16:31:36 +0000 2013,Will try and get through some more tonight, a bunch of ABC and CW ones just came in.
336518143688208400,Mon May 20 16:25:52 +0000 2013,#GangRelated could be a keeper. Does a nice job setting up the pulls of both worlds. Pilot looks slick, expensive. Potential abound.
336516760612266000,Mon May 20 16:20:22 +0000 2013,#Rake is disappointing, just misery for the sake of misery. No window into Kinnear's character, just self destructive for the sake of TV.
336514445620690940,Mon May 20 16:11:10 +0000 2013,#Dads is exactly what you think it's going to be. That's good news or bad news depending on how you feel about the previous sentence.
336513914613420000,Mon May 20 16:09:04 +0000 2013,Want to like #Enlisted more, just hits all the expected beats. More caricature driven than character driven. Like the cast though.

71196013230178300,Thu May 19 12:50:26 +0000 2011,@poniewozik Very much so. Whole show plays as found footage. Finds clever ways to get around the usual documentary claustrophobia tho.
71194973869047810,Thu May 19 12:46:19 +0000 2011,Will have more thoughts this evening, tomorrow; "first looks" will start as soon as brain recovers from upfront week.
71194118067453950,Thu May 19 12:42:55 +0000 2011,Made the mistake of watching "The River" before bed - absolutely unlike anything on TV; some real holy shit moments; fun twists; I'm in
71193957031350270,Thu May 19 12:42:16 +0000 2011,"Person of Interest" just wonderful; plot develops unexpectedly; Emerson just kills it; some great old school stunt work; clever direction
71193833479741440,Thu May 19 12:41:47 +0000 2011,"Alcatraz" is brimming with possibilities, leaves you wanting more; Sarah Jones is a star; wish trailer didn't give away so much, spoils fun
71193709403832320,Thu May 19 12:41:17 +0000 2011,While we wait for The CW, some pilot thoughts. Probably made a mistake starting with these. Going to be tough to top...

70962428946563070,Wed May 18 21:22:16 +0000 2011,Oddly, no trailer for "The 2-2." I guess that's a wrap for CBS!

70958312786632700,Wed May 18 21:05:54 +0000 2011,"A Gifted Man" - strong showcase for Patrick Wilson, the crowd seems to really dig all these dramas
70956751339536380,Wed May 18 20:59:42 +0000 2011,"Unforgettable" trailer feels like it's fresh off the CBS procedural conveyor belt, in other words it should do well.

70952069107945470,Wed May 18 20:41:06 +0000 2011,"How to Be a Gentleman" - could be fun, I want to like it more; Rhys Darby is always a good thing

70595532418072580,Tue May 17 21:04:21 +0000 2011,"Scandal" likewise looks slick; "The River" has potential to be crazy awesome.
70594330812882940,Tue May 17 20:59:34 +0000 2011,"Revenge" trailer looks sharp, how can you not like Emily VanCamp? "Missing" sizzle doesn't do much but script was great.

70590251789332480,Tue May 17 20:43:22 +0000 2011,Hey look, actual laughs from "Suburgatory." It's followed by a clip reel of "Modern Family" which is not fair to any new show.
70589025332895740,Tue May 17 20:38:29 +0000 2011,"Apartment 23" could be fun - trailer doesn't really do it justice though.
70588596603715580,Tue May 17 20:36:47 +0000 2011,"Last Man Standing," "Man Up" pretty standard fare - oh the foibles of middle-aged white guys!

70231375667671040,Mon May 16 20:57:19 +0000 2011,"Terra Nova" trailer doesn't seem to add much to TCA footage. But hey, it's CGI dinosaurs kids!
70229968466100220,Mon May 16 20:51:43 +0000 2011,"Allen Gregory" - animation looks sharp but not exactly packed with laughs.
70229376884686850,Mon May 16 20:49:22 +0000 2011,"I Hate My Teenage Daughter" - shrug, not my cup of tea, FOX multi-camera shows looked/felt the same for years.

70171778990870530,Mon May 16 17:00:30 +0000 2011,Thanks! @adamstotsky "to build a homer" by cinematic orchestra for AWAKE
70171670970769410,Mon May 16 17:00:04 +0000 2011,Not sure how to feel about "Smash" - hard to shake obvious "Glee" connection, it's an ensemble but plays like The Katharine McPhee Show.
70169340057620480,Mon May 16 16:50:49 +0000 2011,Greenblatt jokes "good luck, Kevin Reilly" on following that piece of news.
70169221379801090,Mon May 16 16:50:20 +0000 2011,Donald Trump takes the stage and indicates he's not running for president.
70167309691527170,Mon May 16 16:42:44 +0000 2011,...just a fantastic trailer and hook, can't wait. Anyone know the song used? #Awake
70166244271210500,Mon May 16 16:38:30 +0000 2011,Chills from "Awake" trailer already...
70166014788239360,Mon May 16 16:37:36 +0000 2011,Next: "Chelsea" (makes me actually miss "Whitney"), "Bent" (shrug, could be cute), "BFF" (looks fun, please somehow keep Adam Pally!)
70161200473833470,Mon May 16 16:18:28 +0000 2011,More awkwardness: NBC Sports head Dick Ebersol brings out a bag of foam footballs and throws one into the audience.
70160408924782590,Mon May 16 16:15:19 +0000 2011,Jimmy Fallon filler bit (singing "Have a Comcastic Day!") goes over awkwardly, includes second dig at Paul Reiser today.
70158700559601660,Mon May 16 16:08:32 +0000 2011,"Grimm" likewise plays weird, CGI kind of wonky, as is creepy take on "Sweet Dreams" by Eurythmics for theme
70156505105694720,Mon May 16 15:59:48 +0000 2011,"Whitney" - yeah, let's just pretend that didn't happen; "Prime Suspect" - uneven trailer, lots of broad comedy beats for some reason.
70154088691662850,Mon May 16 15:50:12 +0000 2011,BTW, don't know if this is news but Greenblatt mentioned next "Biggest Loser" season will be old vs. young; "Harry's Law" will add to cast
70153709363015680,Mon May 16 15:48:42 +0000 2011,"Free Agents" trailer goes over less enthusiastically, not a lot of laughs.
70152264886652930,Mon May 16 15:42:57 +0000 2011,"Up All Night" trailer: a charming Christina Applegate and lots of bleeped swearing - I'm in!
