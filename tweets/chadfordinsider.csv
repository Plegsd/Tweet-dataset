668975319609573400,Tue Nov 24 02:11:59 +0000 2015,Ben Simmons finishes with 21 points, 19 rebounds &amp; 7 assists for LSU. Henry Ellenson with 16 pts, 10 rebounds for Marquette
668961903218061300,Tue Nov 24 01:18:41 +0000 2015,But saying that Simmons plays like LeBron or Magic doesn't mean scouts think he's as good as those guys. Has a looong way to go to get there
668961341084823600,Tue Nov 24 01:16:27 +0000 2015,For the record, the Celtics scout was joking. Every team I've spoken with has Simmons No. 1. For most, there isn't a close 2nd...
668957580484411400,Tue Nov 24 01:01:30 +0000 2015,The good news? Long-time GM w/ great draft record to me: "Anyone who doesn't have Simmons No. 1 should be fired." https://t.co/CxqGYxcsnC

614259765561163800,Fri Jun 26 02:31:55 +0000 2015,Milutinov the 1st draft-and-stash pick of the draft. Cavs would‚Äôve taken him if they didn‚Äôt trade. Classic Spurs. You‚Äôre on @franfraschilla
