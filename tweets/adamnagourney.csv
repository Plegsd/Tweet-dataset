783499708295635000,Wed Oct 05 02:51:01 +0000 2016,Win or loose, did Pence do anything tonight to win new votes for Trump (as opposed to raising his own stock in the GOP heading into 2020)?
783498238410104800,Wed Oct 05 02:45:11 +0000 2016,And that was one where Kaine could have had a better retort: Have you seen Trump's tax returns? How do you know? https://t.co/jqYN30Ob40

783489817740914700,Wed Oct 05 02:11:43 +0000 2016,This is the moment when Pence wishes he could sneak a look at his watch.
783488400846237700,Wed Oct 05 02:06:05 +0000 2016,Elaine Quijano is interrupting when she shouldn't -- and standing back when she shouldn't. Debate moderating is tough -- but very important.
783487127623307300,Wed Oct 05 02:01:02 +0000 2016,Watching Pence (and Kaine) is a reminder of just how dramatically unprepared Trump was for his debate.

783483947376185300,Wed Oct 05 01:48:24 +0000 2016,Pence does not have an easy job here. Just stating the obvious
783478884561936400,Wed Oct 05 01:28:17 +0000 2016,Pence just caught up in the who-is-using-the-most-obviously-canned-line fight wiht his "here we go again" moment. Followed by silence.
783477925723058200,Wed Oct 05 01:24:28 +0000 2016,Trump used the tax code brilliantly." -- A Pence line we will probably hear again, from Democrats.
783475451461185500,Wed Oct 05 01:14:38 +0000 2016,1 reason 1st debate was so engaging was moderator stepped aside and let them debate. Hope Elaine Quijano  does that; so far, not so much

755946997711040500,Thu Jul 21 02:06:23 +0000 2016,Question: Did Pence just fall out of the lead of the convention story? Answer: Probably.
755946129557229600,Thu Jul 21 02:02:56 +0000 2016,Cruz just basically dissed, in a very public way, the Republican nominee for president. Don't forget, Rubio did NOT. He all but endorsed him
755945633186472000,Thu Jul 21 02:00:58 +0000 2016,Delegates on floor were yelling "KEEP YOUR PLEDGE" to Cruz, referring to pledge to support nominee. Cruz did not.
755944827204804600,Thu Jul 21 01:57:46 +0000 2016,They are booing Ted Cruz. He might have wore out his welcome with the Trump crowd. He mentioned Trump's name twice.
755943111797473300,Thu Jul 21 01:50:57 +0000 2016,If Cruz gets the nomination in 2020, look back to tonight as  the moment that started it. Like Obama at Democratic convention in 2004
755942167307247600,Thu Jul 21 01:47:12 +0000 2016,Think Trump is throwing his shoe at the television screen right now?
755941479617531900,Thu Jul 21 01:44:28 +0000 2016,Cruz is talking about Trump almost as much as Trump talked about Pence at the VEEP roll-out last Saturday. I.E. not so much. .
755939911166005200,Thu Jul 21 01:38:14 +0000 2016,If Trump was hoping for Cruz endorsement,  looks unlikely. Trump had no choice but giving him a spot, or risk a very divided convention.

755935398464028700,Thu Jul 21 01:20:18 +0000 2016,The way to distinguish GOP speakers: The "vote against Clinton" crowd vs. the "vote FOR Trump" crowd. Ryan/McConnell in 1st. Walker in 2nd.
755921198333165600,Thu Jul 21 00:23:52 +0000 2016,Suspect the "Lock her Up" chant that has become emblem of GOP presidential convention is as rough as any I can recall at conventions.
755919462541459500,Thu Jul 21 00:16:58 +0000 2016,Laura Ingraham at Trump convention laid down gauntlet to, among others, Ted Cruz: "You must honor your pledge to support Donald Trump. Now."

755588660389478400,Wed Jul 20 02:22:29 +0000 2016,By point of comparison: With another nominee, speakers this hour would probably have been George W. Bush. John McCain and/or Mitt Romney.

755579264938803200,Wed Jul 20 01:45:09 +0000 2016,This might be the last high-profile political speech in Chris Christie's career. He's trying to make the most of it.
755578639903625200,Wed Jul 20 01:42:40 +0000 2016,Would Pence ever give a slash-Clinton speech like the one Christie is giving? Could  he? That's subtext of this speech in Cleveland.
755577933956165600,Wed Jul 20 01:39:52 +0000 2016,Watch Christie give his "what-might-have-been" lesson to Trump as he gives his convention speech tonight. First up: The case against Clinton
755575821276807200,Wed Jul 20 01:31:28 +0000 2016,Talking in book language: No blurb quotes from Ryan for Trump to put on his book jacket.
755574984643227600,Wed Jul 20 01:28:08 +0000 2016,Very skillful Ryan speech, says all he needs about Trump &amp; focuses on Obama-Clinton time-for-a-change. He's okay if Trump loses or wins.
755570402542235600,Wed Jul 20 01:09:56 +0000 2016,Still stunning to hear Mitch McConnell get booed at the convention. Also there are empty seats on the floor for him.
