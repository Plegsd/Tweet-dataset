366979607179702300,Mon Aug 12 17:48:51 +0000 2013,In great hands here at SuperAudioMastering with Simon Heyworth and his assistant Andy. So good to be… http://t.co/CsQY73IuVf
366868371591008260,Mon Aug 12 10:26:50 +0000 2013,I've mixed every song apart from the end of #TheLlisteningChair (gonna take me a week to put that last 3sec line together from 634 samples!)
366868052693876740,Mon Aug 12 10:25:34 +0000 2013,and he can slot it in later in the week.  Will do running order + spaces between songs. I've got a close 'rough' version of new song for ref
366867385933762560,Mon Aug 12 10:22:55 +0000 2013,..... And also the 'new' song (track 14 :) as I felt it better to get everything else 100% done. Today will master everything but that...
366865445229301760,Mon Aug 12 10:15:12 +0000 2013,Felt superhuman last night! Amazing flow in the studio!! Loved it loved it. The middle section in #MTM is now a completely different melody!
366864913349619700,Mon Aug 12 10:13:06 +0000 2013,My car wouldn't start so Alex Goodman (filmmaker who was there filming my final moments last night) is driving us both down :) nearly there!
366662311399784450,Sun Aug 11 20:48:01 +0000 2013,#TheListeningChair is now added to the DONE list :) Need to be at MAstering in Devon for 8am which is 10 hours from now and 4 hours drive! x
366431567742107650,Sun Aug 11 05:31:08 +0000 2013,Have succumbed to sleep and have brought my head to rest on my pillow rather than where it was trying to rest, at the desk. Zzz for now x
366414587081392100,Sun Aug 11 04:23:39 +0000 2013,@rahrahmaybe new ones :) x
366414529996922900,Sun Aug 11 04:23:26 +0000 2013,@MimAbbyMason well... there are 600+ of these so will certainly take me a while as some are noisy too so will need to de-noise! x
366414344432517100,Sun Aug 11 04:22:42 +0000 2013,@rahrahmaybe not quite yet! xx
366413638795411460,Sun Aug 11 04:19:53 +0000 2013,well that was a slightly longer departure from mixing than I'd had in mind! All #WhoAmInow samples in computer + will cut up + sort later! x
366394549276389400,Sun Aug 11 03:04:02 +0000 2013,Getting a spot of exercise in to give me energy for the next round of mixing while they're recording in :) http://t.co/48Ft2AW76c
366388134038077440,Sun Aug 11 02:38:32 +0000 2013,how long do you think it takes 634 who am I now's to record into the computer? will let you know in a bit!
366384384967852000,Sun Aug 11 02:23:39 +0000 2013,it's actually really amazing hearing them all strung together! Love that so many of you will be on this song :) x xx wooP!
366383885837279200,Sun Aug 11 02:21:40 +0000 2013,634 who am i nows! Yowza, that's going to take me a weeee while to put together! ha... am now recording all the audio into my computer :) x
366355214351081500,Sun Aug 11 00:27:44 +0000 2013,#MindsWithoutFear now has louder verse bass and additional kick/snare sound for definition. Somehow these 'little' things take hours! x
366299874506969100,Sat Aug 10 20:47:50 +0000 2013,#Entanglement done :) I really love this song. Excited for you to hear when it finds your ears. Xx
366292595774722050,Sat Aug 10 20:18:54 +0000 2013,Ok.... Just did a bounce of #YKWTFM with .5db on the vocals. Seems to be nice :) also... There was this weird 'clacky' sound in big section
366292330212376600,Sat Aug 10 20:17:51 +0000 2013,@dec23k ha.. Weirdly you actually don't want to hear the kick.. When It was in, it slowed down the mix... The bounce is in the space left x
366272899813879800,Sat Aug 10 19:00:38 +0000 2013,So I went completely overboard with #Lifeline's kick last night (this morning). I think I'd lost a little perspective perhaps! Back on track
366272503972245500,Sat Aug 10 18:59:04 +0000 2013,@Garsh_its_Marsh actually it's still months away from being released but I will be finished in my studio with the mixes as of Monday. :/
366136883471855600,Sat Aug 10 10:00:10 +0000 2013,Takes a while to wind down after mega mix session. Off for a helicopter ride (birthday present) in 5hrs! Find song order in the clouds? Zzz
366093228191129600,Sat Aug 10 07:06:41 +0000 2013,Final #Lifeline mix. More kick and have doubled up the Marxophone part with @Soniccouture's extended piano so hear more note than rattle :)
366048559344271360,Sat Aug 10 04:09:12 +0000 2013,Seems #Run-time was nowhere NEAR finished! New calmer middle section, simpler intro, de-essed + other bits and bobs. Made all the difference
365941413269090300,Fri Aug 09 21:03:26 +0000 2013,All these 'who am I now' samples on @SoundCloud are AWESOME! Saturday night, I'll hit record to capture them one by one and have a wee cuppa

364529831369007100,Mon Aug 05 23:34:19 +0000 2013,Bit disjointed for studio time today as outside world starts to creep back in. Hitting the Heap hay early for a head start tmw x night all x

364235608304414700,Mon Aug 05 04:05:10 +0000 2013,Beginning of Me The Machine :) I never expected it to take me here but It's oddly machine dream perfect!  http://t.co/ZJrCTrtwCP
364181513299955700,Mon Aug 05 00:30:13 +0000 2013,There's no song on the album yet that just comes in straight with the lyric....hmmmm.... gonna have a go...
364181256281796600,Mon Aug 05 00:29:12 +0000 2013,a thought crossed my mind while eating my fruit salad. Perhaps #MeTheMachine needs its whole intro ditching + come in straight at the verse?
364078895861350400,Sun Aug 04 17:42:27 +0000 2013,@Luke_Brown great :) well you're gonna love the new mix. Lots more bass in it :)

364067238359625700,Sun Aug 04 16:56:08 +0000 2013,Ahh.. I don't know though actually... Erm... They all are like my babies. I feel bad having favourites. They change over time too. X
364066567489064960,Sun Aug 04 16:53:28 +0000 2013,@GeorgeBrooks3 @DemeMeanie agreed! Bloody annoying!

364065125155602400,Sun Aug 04 16:47:44 +0000 2013,The 7 songs are #Lifeline #PropellerSeeds #NeglectedSpace #MindsWithoutfear #XiziSheKnows #YouKnowWhereToFindMe #Telemiscommunications x
364064257597390850,Sun Aug 04 16:44:17 +0000 2013,@bitbin hmmm... For me personally very important as a body of work but am all too aware maybe only 1% of people will listen as an album! X
364061339393605600,Sun Aug 04 16:32:41 +0000 2013,Out of interest... What's your favourite out of the seven songs I've released already? Xx
364060173221904400,Sun Aug 04 16:28:03 +0000 2013,I  am now going to go for a walk and form a new plan! Album won't be released now until November but you're gonna get an awesome extra song!
364059705527640060,Sun Aug 04 16:26:12 +0000 2013,Decision is ... To spend a week extra on it then really enjoy this last stretch. Adding an extra song was a bit much so close to the end xx
364040034787545100,Sun Aug 04 15:08:02 +0000 2013,Oh my GOD!!!!!! I've just slotted in some strings parts that Vince and Emma (aka geese, who toured with me) have recorded for me. Awesome!!
363942138809417700,Sun Aug 04 08:39:02 +0000 2013,Oscillating between I'll manage it by Tuesday + needing another week! Another 24 hour day now sleep again for a few hours. Xx
363368628063698940,Fri Aug 02 18:40:06 +0000 2013,So my plan is eat soup, sleep as long as possible, then go for a 59.5 minute long car ride to listen to mixes so far. Long album for me :) x
363358806811484160,Fri Aug 02 18:01:05 +0000 2013,argh! ok... i didn't go to sleep but I did write the verse lyrics for the new song! ON A MEGA ROLL! xxx
363331349500801000,Fri Aug 02 16:11:58 +0000 2013,Gonna take me a couple of days to follow its lead. Very surprising! Can't wait for you to hear! (if I keep it!) I really have to go to bed!
363330786495168500,Fri Aug 02 16:09:44 +0000 2013,well... I never in a million years expected #meTheMachine to take me there! The chorus sounds like you've walked into a french cafe! xx
363259987659092000,Fri Aug 02 11:28:24 +0000 2013,@wickwox actually not recently. It's a bit flat.... Maybe should switch back though these next few days to stop this happening x

363256983752687600,Fri Aug 02 11:16:28 +0000 2013,A breakthrough with #MeTheMachine. Time to let the live version stay the live version (#theGloves) + studio version be the studio version!
363256502577938400,Fri Aug 02 11:14:33 +0000 2013,My ankles are completely swollen from being in the same spot mixing/re-recording in a 12 hour marathon mix. Didn't even go to the loo!

361982980652138500,Mon Jul 29 22:54:02 +0000 2013,#Lifeline sounds way better but maybe even a tad more bass + piano. Currently beefing up #NeglectedSpace + resinging 'Stop in the...' vocal

329420093983432700,Wed May 01 02:20:45 +0000 2013,Ooh that chord led to many places including a rabbit hole. Was a fun trip! #MeTheMachine = 99% done. Sneaked some mbira in among machines.

328635892463976450,Sun Apr 28 22:24:37 +0000 2013,Been beavering away on what I thought was final mix day for #MeTheMachine when this total curveball chord came in and got me all excited! x
328635238689423360,Sun Apr 28 22:22:01 +0000 2013,@budhammers I am having similar thoughts. Amazing really! I've been one version of me for so long. Am ready to unlock some other ones ...

328343062352904200,Sun Apr 28 03:01:01 +0000 2013,Had a mad 3 hr session jamming on piano making weird noises with my voice. Not often I get the house to myself :) Good thoughts came from it

324319799117217800,Wed Apr 17 00:34:00 +0000 2013,@rahrahmaybe family time... :) more travel and study x
324318973959237600,Wed Apr 17 00:30:43 +0000 2013,Mixing #TheListeningChair is rather tedious! So many vocals = lots of gremlins like mouth clicks, pops and tons of delicate de-easing! Xx
323258616234786800,Sun Apr 14 02:17:14 +0000 2013,@LupeFiasco well then! Xx Let's keep in touch :) xx

323244165225910300,Sun Apr 14 01:19:49 +0000 2013,@rahrahmaybe Yup. definitely need list of songs/lyrics on there. I was thinking of 'Bite sized lifeboats, I'll fix your smashed up head' x
323243566795206660,Sun Apr 14 01:17:26 +0000 2013,@ProjectAIP that's not true actually. I wrote songs as early as 5 but being bullied at boarding school certainly helped my songwriting!
323242766085804000,Sun Apr 14 01:14:15 +0000 2013,Searching If I'd used 'quick fix' in a song b4/ not to repeat myself. So many incorrect lyrics everywhere! e.g. http://t.co/RrGMDmigcL :/

321642470242938900,Tue Apr 09 15:15:15 +0000 2013,@JonathanAngwin am currently asking myself that question. Should i leave as is, or tweak a bit (namely redo some vox/sort bass) for album? X
318152431798190100,Sun Mar 31 00:07:05 +0000 2013,@hausofdavid not now... But soon xx
318152170669219840,Sun Mar 31 00:06:03 +0000 2013,@M_D_Witt read that wrong.. It won't be released before the album I don't think as I can't find the cash to make the video I want. X
318151919774359550,Sun Mar 31 00:05:03 +0000 2013,@M_D_Witt had a listen to that too today and decided the studio version's not all that bad :) another few days it'll be ready for the album.
318150809420447740,Sun Mar 31 00:00:38 +0000 2013,Finished #TheListeningChair lyric today. Was never quite happy with the final section. A few months break from it was just the thing :)

315848067259711500,Sun Mar 24 15:30:22 +0000 2013,@Guy_Garvey ha! What did you do? Keep it/ ditch it?

304403652477583360,Thu Feb 21 01:34:20 +0000 2013,@Nylons my dear dad's dear dad. Involved reading the newspaper (which i also fear) + looking up words we didn't know...
304402244579770400,Thu Feb 21 01:28:45 +0000 2013,That idea blossomed while jamming video ideas with  Rod Temperton (the guy who wrote Thriller, it wasn't MJ), which is pretty cool :)
304400322825179140,Thu Feb 21 01:21:07 +0000 2013,@rahrahmaybe yup, maybe to prove I can do it? Articulate myself on some level at least. I don't say 'er' in songs :) (maybe I should once..)
304399840941584400,Thu Feb 21 01:19:12 +0000 2013,I wanted make a crowd sourced video of people dancing to my version of #Thriller with what they fear on the screen in text. #Still may do.
304397126933311500,Thu Feb 21 01:08:25 +0000 2013,force fed the dictionary put the fear of words into me : came out during scribbling. it's one of the reasons I write songs I think
304351328556175360,Wed Feb 20 22:06:25 +0000 2013,Indeed! Been waiting to! #ifihadglass I'd hook them up w/my gloves to help me navigate music making in 3D http://t.co/gjbkaDXumH @vincentgr

304339981583937540,Wed Feb 20 21:21:20 +0000 2013,@solobasssteve too true. Perhaps the final song with nudge me to ask it more often outside of music. Easy to lose track.
304338208634830850,Wed Feb 20 21:14:17 +0000 2013,@ianshepherd @laurawasylyshen @neilhimself not yet! Will check it out. Thank you x
304337224621781000,Wed Feb 20 21:10:23 +0000 2013,@solobasssteve well said. Which is probably why I find myself asking it today again. To bottle into a song feels like a good challenge :)

280062461007253500,Sat Dec 15 21:31:08 +0000 2012,@Hanna_Preston not sure to be honest. I don't listen to my own music but this piece will change on every listen/jog so perhaps?
280062144492498940,Sat Dec 15 21:29:53 +0000 2012,@live1052 I do that often. :) half the time, I 'fix' musical problems in the studio during a jog! X
280061961272717300,Sat Dec 15 21:29:09 +0000 2012,@rahrahmaybe nop! Strangely I rarely listen to music full stop.
280061178506514430,Sat Dec 15 21:26:02 +0000 2012,I love jogging + music but I can't listen to music when I run, which is why I like the challenge of making a #JoggingMusicApp x
280056664470732800,Sat Dec 15 21:08:06 +0000 2012,Joggers/runners. If you listen to music while exercising, do you tend to run on the beat or not. Does your jog change speed with the tempo?
280018562582716400,Sat Dec 15 18:36:42 +0000 2012,That was very helpful! 118 - 172bpm roughly. Fave tempos around 120-150. Hmm... food for thought! #JoggingApp @RJDJ @DizzyBanjo
280011009408782340,Sat Dec 15 18:06:41 +0000 2012,out of interest everyone... if you do jog... what's your favourite jogging tune? #JoggingApp @rjdj @dizzyBanjo
