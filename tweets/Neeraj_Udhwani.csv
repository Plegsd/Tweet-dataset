671204923607023600,Mon Nov 30 05:51:38 +0000 2015,@akshayerathi also, Film like Tamasha create value for the production house. Haider wasn't a superhit but UTv gained immensely by backing it
671204704748232700,Mon Nov 30 05:50:46 +0000 2015,@akshayerathi it's too early to pass a judgement on this. Tamasha is not a flop like shaandar was. Time will tell if it makes a profit
