66051173618163710,Thu May 05 08:06:41 +0000 2011,"Can I be the space for this?" is the primordial spiritual practice. Usually, or always, you will find that, yes, you can be.
66051010988224510,Thu May 05 08:06:02 +0000 2011,Presence is when you're no longer waiting for the next moment, believing that the next moment will be more fulfilling than this one.
66050986598342660,Thu May 05 08:05:57 +0000 2011,Waiting is a state of mind, the usual state of mind.
66050740061339650,Thu May 05 08:04:58 +0000 2011,To be in the grip of an opinion means to be in the grip of your mind and mistaking that for who you are in essence.
25293172712144896,Wed Jan 12 20:48:56 +0000 2011,You can't wait for the end of your problems for you to be present. It has to be done wherever you are—which is now.
25293075341381630,Wed Jan 12 20:48:33 +0000 2011,Feel a sense of lack and then try to create abundance. Your power is greatly diminished.
25293060011196416,Wed Jan 12 20:48:30 +0000 2011,If you want abundance, you need to find that sense of fullness first, which is inseparable from the present moment.
13403973440507904,Sat Dec 11 01:25:30 +0000 2010,... Ultimately what you do is secondary. But how you do it is primary.
13403948371148800,Sat Dec 11 01:25:24 +0000 2010,Some may do great things; others may do things that look less significant on the surface....
11239425887444992,Sun Dec 05 02:04:22 +0000 2010,A greater intelligence is available to you when you no longer reject, deny, or 'don't want' what is.
11239394304331776,Sun Dec 05 02:04:15 +0000 2010,Bring a 'yes' to the isness, because it's pointless to argue if it already is.
11239302990139392,Sun Dec 05 02:03:53 +0000 2010,Instead of creating expectations of what should or should not be happening, cooperate with the form that this moment takes.
23855722412,Tue Sep 07 21:54:46 +0000 2010,If aligned with the moment, the kind of action you take is qualitatively different then when you deny or dislike the present moment.
21856479037,Sun Aug 22 20:34:19 +0000 2010,Ultimately, it's not what happens "out there" that upsets you, it's what happens in your mind.

13798637338,Tue May 11 17:01:36 +0000 2010,Creativity arises out of the state of thoughtless presence in which you are much more awake than when you are engrossed in thinking.
13214804159,Sat May 01 23:50:29 +0000 2010,Do not equate unconsciousness with who the person is.

12586985311,Wed Apr 21 16:57:30 +0000 2010,The only existence what we call 'future' has is as a thought in your head. Beyond that there's no such thing as future.

11833646276,Thu Apr 08 17:11:31 +0000 2010,Whenever you step out of the noise of thinking, that is meditation, and a different state of consciousness arises.
11786942118,Wed Apr 07 21:15:26 +0000 2010,The short cut is any spiritual teaching that cuts through the long way, the painful way of waking up.
11786935449,Wed Apr 07 21:15:17 +0000 2010,Suffering the consequences of unconsciousness is the fire that burns up the false ego, but that's the long, slow, painful way.
11782625411,Wed Apr 07 19:34:19 +0000 2010,How do I know? Because you are here, listening, watching, sensing the power of presence within yourself.
11782608823,Wed Apr 07 19:33:56 +0000 2010,A transformation of consciousness is already happening at this moment.
10733225024,Fri Mar 19 17:39:13 +0000 2010,No need to wait for the next moment or some other bit of information before you can become present, alert, still, and aware in the Now.
10526144099,Mon Mar 15 17:08:09 +0000 2010,There's absolutely nothing to work out in your mind; it's too simple.
10526140775,Mon Mar 15 17:08:04 +0000 2010,To be present here is to be rooted in yourself, in being. It's to feel that subtle sense of aliveness.
10526077084,Mon Mar 15 17:06:24 +0000 2010,Welcome to the present moment. Here. Now. The only moment there ever is.

8820268231,Mon Feb 08 18:57:01 +0000 2010,Take responsibility for your state of consciousness Now. This is what the entire teaching really is about.
8652195133,Thu Feb 04 23:14:33 +0000 2010,Are you one with life or a thought form?
8650956201,Thu Feb 04 22:40:25 +0000 2010,Is it possible for you to embrace uncertainty, and not demand that you should know what is going to happen to you in your life situation?

4995584144,Mon Oct 19 17:13:28 +0000 2009,They're being pulled out of now, which is all there ever is-life itself. Nothing else ever exists except now.
4995580171,Mon Oct 19 17:13:17 +0000 2009,Very few human beings are actually where they are, rooted in the presence of now. They are continuously reaching out for more.
4899694924,Thu Oct 15 22:03:18 +0000 2009,...that deepest truth of human existence is already emerging in you as you sit here and listen.
4899666384,Thu Oct 15 22:01:56 +0000 2009,Even as you sit here and follow the words that progressively explore the deepest truth of human existence...
4866977990,Wed Oct 14 17:27:03 +0000 2009,...looking, perceiving the aliveness, sensing the aliveness that is all around you, even in stones? There's always a choice.
4866971958,Wed Oct 14 17:26:46 +0000 2009,Or are you there as aware consciousness, the field of conscious presence...
4866942809,Wed Oct 14 17:25:28 +0000 2009,Wherever you may be, ask yourself: Are you there as the carrier of your personal history plus your problematic future?
4842111191,Tue Oct 13 19:14:35 +0000 2009,Look around the room a few times a day as if you had just been born into that room.
4842104053,Tue Oct 13 19:14:15 +0000 2009,We can bring that into everyday life through being aware of the inner energy field of the body, being alert to sense perceptions.
4842096079,Tue Oct 13 19:13:53 +0000 2009,...the dimension of no thought out of which all wisdom comes, and that which is also in you.
4842093288,Tue Oct 13 19:13:45 +0000 2009,She or he is simply aware of the dimension of stillness...
4842080495,Tue Oct 13 19:13:11 +0000 2009,The wise woman, the wise man has nothing that you don't have.
4838329877,Tue Oct 13 16:19:58 +0000 2009,...because underneath all your thinking there is the stillness of pure being, pure consciousness, the timeless dimension of yourself.
4838317871,Tue Oct 13 16:19:26 +0000 2009,You are the vastness in which these thoughts appear and disappear...
4838171623,Tue Oct 13 16:12:52 +0000 2009,You are not your thoughts; they come and go.
4838166203,Tue Oct 13 16:12:37 +0000 2009,You are not what happens; you are the space in which it happens.
4745661306,Fri Oct 09 21:50:24 +0000 2009,The now is deeper, the now is who you are as the space of conscious presence that makes it all possible, that makes the whole world possible
4745646396,Fri Oct 09 21:49:44 +0000 2009,Not the content that fills this moment. That's not the now. That's what happens in the now, the content.
4745638427,Fri Oct 09 21:49:22 +0000 2009,What is the now? Not the content that fills this moment with sense perceptions, with experiences, with thoughts and emotions.
4743805292,Fri Oct 09 20:26:05 +0000 2009,You're not here any longer as the carrier of your personal history, but you're here as an alive field of aware presence.
4743799072,Fri Oct 09 20:25:48 +0000 2009,And allow quite simply an alert presence to be there.
4743788782,Fri Oct 09 20:25:20 +0000 2009,To be free of thousands of years of conditioning does not require time or future. At this moment you can step out of the movement of thought

4348487674,Thu Sep 24 18:43:33 +0000 2009,Most egos have conflicting wants.  They want different things at different times or may not even know what they want.....
4348459382,Thu Sep 24 18:42:07 +0000 2009,Yet, if you look more closely, that is to say, through your own immediate experience, you find that there are not many moments at all.
4348445088,Thu Sep 24 18:41:23 +0000 2009,Time is seen as the endless succession of moments, some "good", some "bad"....
4348416168,Thu Sep 24 18:40:03 +0000 2009,Thinking is no more than a tiny aspect of the totality of consciousness, the totality of who you are.
2895443085,Tue Jul 28 19:25:35 +0000 2009,"Am I at ease at this moment?" is a good question to ask youself frequently.
2895430695,Tue Jul 28 19:24:49 +0000 2009,Make it a habit to moniter your mental-emotional state through self-observation.

1690905692,Sun May 03 23:38:56 +0000 2009,Conscious listening...not the words or the thoughts you're thinking, "what can I do, how can I help?", it's your full attention given.

1689904477,Sun May 03 21:22:59 +0000 2009,Even without your life's stories, your fears, your desires... you are still there.  That is your true self.
1689890762,Sun May 03 21:21:07 +0000 2009,Regarding my last question...There's something there, but you can't define it.

1681558331,Sat May 02 21:20:21 +0000 2009,@SincerelyTiff One may feel threatened and become defensive or aggressive if they are clinging to their opinion as if they WERE the opinion.
1681371860,Sat May 02 20:52:05 +0000 2009,Notice when you feel aggressive or defensive.  Is it because you are identified with a mental position?
