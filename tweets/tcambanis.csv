927281994794496000,Sun Nov 05 21:10:30 +0000 2017,Good thread on Saudi machinations in Lebanon, likely to backfire on their authors. https://t.co/ROPQdA8TIc

927264624919171100,Sun Nov 05 20:01:28 +0000 2017,14. Easy for one miscalculation to upset the equilibrium and spark wider regional war. (end thread)
927264595244388400,Sun Nov 05 20:01:21 +0000 2017,13. Not wise to depend on restraint and strategic thinking from this lot.
927264553121079300,Sun Nov 05 20:01:11 +0000 2017,12. Risks higher b/c Saudis, Trump willing to gamble. Israel might restrain b/c it would suffer in war w Hezbollah
927264518836809700,Sun Nov 05 20:01:03 +0000 2017,11. Despite destabilizing maximalism in Syria, Nasrallah now can position as restrained statesman
927264486238629900,Sun Nov 05 20:00:55 +0000 2017,10. Saudis want winner-takes-all outcomes, quick resolutions. Balance of power shifts on longer timeframe
927264457016868900,Sun Nov 05 20:00:48 +0000 2017,9. Saudi patrons undermined, humiliated, bankrupted Hariri; their Lebanese losing perch in Sunni community
927264419834421200,Sun Nov 05 20:00:40 +0000 2017,8. Lebanon contested, but resignation from Saudi underscores weakness of Hariri &amp; his sponsors. Can't change Hezbollah dominance.
927264275059667000,Sun Nov 05 20:00:05 +0000 2017,7. Trump impetuous, indifferent or unaware if missteps engulf Middle East in more avoidable wars
927264242671259600,Sun Nov 05 19:59:57 +0000 2017,6. Iran able to deter direct challenges with credible threats; goals accomplished in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon
927264216595226600,Sun Nov 05 19:59:51 +0000 2017,5. Saudi lacks capacity, strategic patience, insight. Terrible at leveraging cash &amp; power.
927264187860045800,Sun Nov 05 19:59:44 +0000 2017,4. Risks going forward depend on strategic context, goals of Saudi, Iran &amp; US
927264156272783400,Sun Nov 05 19:59:37 +0000 2017,3. Hard to imagine Saudi collapsing, but equally hard to imagine it acquiring capacity to steer region
927264123699769300,Sun Nov 05 19:59:29 +0000 2017,2. Nasrallah speech intended to calm fears of civil strife in Lebanon or war with Israel.
927264077008818200,Sun Nov 05 19:59:18 +0000 2017,1. Further thoughts on Lebanon after Nasrallah speech &amp; night of long knives in Saudi (thread)

926899899723124700,Sat Nov 04 19:52:11 +0000 2017,13/Implications and reach of Hariri resignation ought to be clearer in a few days. / end
926899865333968900,Sat Nov 04 19:52:03 +0000 2017,12/However, just like yesterday, pre-resignation, Hezbollah &amp; Israel can still avert war that suits neither
926899774783131600,Sat Nov 04 19:51:41 +0000 2017,11/Catastrophic war could break out between Israel &amp; Lebanon because of electoral campaigning gone amok
926899733213433900,Sat Nov 04 19:51:32 +0000 2017,10/All Lebanese parties posturing for domestic constituencies. So are Netanyahu &amp; Trump.
926899686031740900,Sat Nov 04 19:51:20 +0000 2017,9/Risks of miscalculation higher with Lebanese government more fragile.
926899633804148700,Sat Nov 04 19:51:08 +0000 2017,8/Volume of voices saying war more likely now makes me wonder: why the fear-mongering?
926899586760929300,Sat Nov 04 19:50:57 +0000 2017,7/…  Hariri &amp; co can fare better, preserve their communities &amp; minority share of power, although unlikely to play smart or strategic
926899401116799000,Sat Nov 04 19:50:12 +0000 2017,6/Hariri, backers &amp; allies simply cannot win confrontation in Lebanon w Hezbollah; …
926899364450234400,Sat Nov 04 19:50:04 +0000 2017,5/Whatever motives, fundamental balance of power same: Hezbollah &amp; allies stronger in Lebanon, but w limits to control
926899257252155400,Sat Nov 04 19:49:38 +0000 2017,4/Maybe Saudi wants to give #Hariri another try; but discredits judgment of both that resignation announced from KSA.
926899193087774700,Sat Nov 04 19:49:23 +0000 2017,3/#Hariri weak politician w bad instincts. Lost Saudi support in recent years. Eroded popularity.
926899087139590100,Sat Nov 04 19:48:57 +0000 2017,2/More clarity after a few days, with #Nasrallah speech on Sunday, but some fundamentals:
926899012799729700,Sat Nov 04 19:48:40 +0000 2017,1/#Hariri resignation in #Lebanon provokes hot takes and anxiety; that’s a design feature of the move
