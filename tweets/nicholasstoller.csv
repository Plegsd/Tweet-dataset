771703512925401100,Fri Sep 02 13:37:09 +0000 2016,In which scenario Kevin is a Buddha like figure neither waiting nor trying to wait nor doing. Just being.
771703492276781000,Fri Sep 02 13:37:04 +0000 2016,Or if Kevin neither waits nor does perhaps the correct title is Kevin Is.
771703471322099700,Fri Sep 02 13:36:59 +0000 2016,Or just Kevin Does.
771703449431969800,Fri Sep 02 13:36:54 +0000 2016,Which leads me to believe the show could include moments when Kevin isn't waiting but rather doing. So why isn't it called Kevin Can Do?
771703427562897400,Fri Sep 02 13:36:49 +0000 2016,Unless Kevin isn't waiting. It's just he has the ability to wait should the need for waiting arise. In which case Kevin Can Wait works.
771703269345357800,Fri Sep 02 13:36:11 +0000 2016,And if Kevin Can Wait has nothing to do with Heaven Can Wait why isn't it just called Kevin Waits? Seems pithier.
771703232993329200,Fri Sep 02 13:36:02 +0000 2016,Or does Kevin Can Wait have nothing to do with heaven or the aforementioned film and its premise shall remain mysterious until its premiere?
771703185031434200,Fri Sep 02 13:35:51 +0000 2016,Or in Kevin Can Wait is it that Kevin James literally waits in heaven? IE he's in purgatory due to transgressions committed during his life?
