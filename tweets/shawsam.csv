867959339872526300,Fri May 26 04:23:27 +0000 2017,When I was at Iowa "Jesus' Son" was the King James Bible. I used to carry the FSG paperback around in my pocket. I read it every year.

865628872720568300,Fri May 19 18:03:00 +0000 2017,But I held onto it. It's moved across state lines, across the country. For 26 years it's hung in a succession of dark closets, waiting.

865625725985890300,Fri May 19 17:50:30 +0000 2017,I never, ever missed an episode of Twin Peaks. I loved and obsessed over all 30. Even the embarrassing "Little Nicky" run.
865625610973925400,Fri May 19 17:50:02 +0000 2017,In our household that was like Nietzsche proclaiming, "God is dead."
865625454455042000,Fri May 19 17:49:25 +0000 2017,When the pilot ended we all sat in bewildered silence. Then my dad turned and announced, "There goes Cheers."
