160298089893216260,Fri Jan 20 09:50:17 +0000 2012,@Mozzie21 I just know what's appropriate in this forum. It is painfully obvious that you don't

160286605834321920,Fri Jan 20 09:04:39 +0000 2012,@stevesmith49 Dolgopolov looks reasonably dynamic. Will be tough to beat tonight I think

160282065772879870,Fri Jan 20 08:46:37 +0000 2012,@Mozzie21. Very funny you poor man's Spaniard. You resemble Carla Suarez Navarro. Get that gap narrower between your eyebrows and hairline.

159253320068907000,Tue Jan 17 12:38:44 +0000 2012,@joeyskid @mozzie21. Thank you. It was Manly like behaviour at best.

159249252667752450,Tue Jan 17 12:22:35 +0000 2012,What about Lleyton Hewitt lying flat on his back after his epic 1st round win against the great Cedric Marcel Stebe? Totally appropriate.
