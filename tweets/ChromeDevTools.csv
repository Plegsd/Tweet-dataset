535561163816177660,Thu Nov 20 22:31:46 +0000 2014,@kctang wow, that's a tiny viewport. We build the device mode with virtual viewport for that: simulate narrow without resizing the browser.
535560349731131400,Thu Nov 20 22:28:32 +0000 2014,@mirceadesign nope, should be there in Canary. In Timeline, make sure "Paint" checkbox is checked, then record and click on a big grey bar

535557672511078400,Thu Nov 20 22:17:53 +0000 2014,@shovemedia I can see how that could be annoying. We should probably fix the tab navigation all around.
535140948611571700,Wed Nov 19 18:41:59 +0000 2014,@rctneil weird. If still happening, can you file a bug at http://t.co/Z2y2ZShepo and pass us the link? We'll investigate.
