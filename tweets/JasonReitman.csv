5107934247,Fri Oct 23 21:55:10 +0000 2009,Body Snatchers was pretty great. I always have to get over the hump of the over acting in classic films, but the story really worked.

5099844867,Fri Oct 23 15:55:18 +0000 2009,@edgarwright To be fair, I also said "Big Trouble In Little China" was one of the most underrated films of all time.

2340859450,Fri Jun 26 07:28:08 +0000 2009,Screening went great. Damn if I'm not going to reorder the first act again. Will dream about various combinations.
2329440191,Thu Jun 25 17:45:24 +0000 2009,Just reviewing some Jenn's Body trailers. Then off to the UITA screening. Fingers crossed. Followed by BadMeaningBad rehearsal. Busy day.
2316504106,Wed Jun 24 21:21:55 +0000 2009,On the way to Bad Meaning Bad rehearsal. Big show Friday at Cinespace. www.badmeaningbad.com
2303190427,Wed Jun 24 00:51:14 +0000 2009,A lot of interest in coming to the screening Thursday. Two things. 1. No. 2. You're going to enjoy it so much more when it's done.
2302575486,Wed Jun 24 00:00:12 +0000 2009,Worked on temp music today. Gearing up for a small screening Thursday. Thirty college students. I always start with that to test the waters.
2301959401,Tue Jun 23 23:08:40 +0000 2009,RT - @firstshowing I absolutely LOVE this poster for Up in the Air, as seen at CinExpo. http://is.gd/1b1HN
2295512181,Tue Jun 23 15:01:23 +0000 2009,RT - @katerbee You should do a mashup of yourself and that Swedish vamp movie "Let the Right One In" and call it "Let the Reitman In"
2260869627,Sun Jun 21 02:54:11 +0000 2009,Worked through a page of notes today. I have five scenes to tweak tomorrow before we screen again. Starting to place a lot of music.
2243212567,Fri Jun 19 20:09:52 +0000 2009,Reorder seems to work. Going to screen it this afternoon for a few friends to check. Def getting rid of the song.
2240343648,Fri Jun 19 16:37:59 +0000 2009,Screened again for small inner circle. Going to reorder the first act again. Ready?  Scenes 4-14, opening titles, 15-33, 1, 34-35, 2.
2228625853,Thu Jun 18 21:40:45 +0000 2009,Apparently as prevalent in the other movie as that "Bow Bow, Oh Yeah" song was in Ferris Bueller.
2228585029,Thu Jun 18 21:37:34 +0000 2009,I spent the day cutting to the song. It really works. I've never actually seen the other movie... but my office is giving me crap about it.
2223365102,Thu Jun 18 15:10:58 +0000 2009,Torturing myself over whether or not I can use a song that was used prominently in this mediocre remake from ten years ago.
2213553620,Wed Jun 17 22:31:46 +0000 2009,Just tried a new song against the packing sequence... Works beautifully... Don't worry, I'll include the ballet version on the DVD.
2209734169,Wed Jun 17 17:44:03 +0000 2009,Just moved the monorail scene back to its original spot. I was wrong.
2199219773,Wed Jun 17 00:11:17 +0000 2009,@diablocody I can't rewrite testicular history... but I might be able to show you the film soon...
2198375121,Tue Jun 16 22:59:32 +0000 2009,I love making my dad cry. Back in the editing room and cutting up a storm. Prob going to cut another five minutes this week.
2194564450,Tue Jun 16 16:57:57 +0000 2009,About to show a rough cut to my dad. Remember what it was like to show your homework to your folks...? Imagine a feature film.
2185764307,Tue Jun 16 00:52:14 +0000 2009,Running Time: 1 hour 59 minutes 34 seconds. Auditioning a few songs against picture right now.

2160374759,Sun Jun 14 01:52:17 +0000 2009,About to take part in one of the hallmarks of good editing... At the Grove seeing a trashy movie to boost my confidence.
2158031493,Sat Jun 13 21:35:34 +0000 2009,Moved the monorail scene later and it's working like a charm. Yes, I'm editing on Saturdays.
2137071694,Fri Jun 12 21:38:01 +0000 2009,Reorder of scenes worked like a charm. Thank you all for your confidence, except @RockRollGhost @TryTheWine @PaperHeartMovie who doubted me.
2134157333,Fri Jun 12 17:40:23 +0000 2009,tried it - RT @EthanRunt Start with scene 54, then 23, 1, 67, 29, end credits, 78, 15, 32, 23 again then opening titles, then studio logos?
2133308159,Fri Jun 12 16:33:39 +0000 2009,Today's experiment: Open the movie with scene 2. Follow it with scene 3. Go to opening titles. Then show scene 1.
2119969147,Thu Jun 11 18:06:11 +0000 2009,Watched the film last night. 2nd act is really working. Lots of little trims to make. Cutting a couple scenes. Will be under 2 hrs by Mon.
2109329099,Wed Jun 10 22:32:38 +0000 2009,@diablocody 1. I'm telling mom. 2. Per Sneakers Reboot casting: Pitt as Redford. Redford as college aged flashback Redford.
2108059494,Wed Jun 10 20:42:28 +0000 2009,@mindykaling Phenomenal screenplay. Remember hearing it took twelve years to write. Updating IMDB now: Kaling/Reitman Sneakers Reboot (2021)
2106650412,Wed Jun 10 18:41:04 +0000 2009,Everyone in my office is annoyed because we're cutting a crying scene, so it's just constant wailing coming from the editing room.
2092822476,Tue Jun 09 18:41:12 +0000 2009,Just got a sample of my new opening titles from Shadowplay, who did Juno and Smoking... These guys are awesome in a bottle.
2076627611,Mon Jun 08 14:40:13 +0000 2009,Week four of editing begins today. I'm two scenes and three montages away from a first cut. Current running time: 2 hours 4 minutes.
2066168443,Sun Jun 07 17:00:57 +0000 2009,This is the first and perhaps only tweet I will ever write. I'm three weeks into editing. I'll try to be as forthright as possible.
