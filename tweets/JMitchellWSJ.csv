889494560136626200,Mon Jul 24 14:36:43 +0000 2017,11) but I'm told by people smarter than me that it's mostly prestigious schools with highly selective admissions
889494381992042500,Mon Jul 24 14:36:01 +0000 2017,10) One important note. Many colleges are indeed still charging significantly charging more...
889494081700847600,Mon Jul 24 14:34:49 +0000 2017,9) For publics, higher state appropriations in recent years has relieved pressure for them to charge students more.
889493884245594100,Mon Jul 24 14:34:02 +0000 2017,8) Credit constraints also possible. Maximum in fed grants/loans haven't been raised in years, and many students can't get private loans
889493502152912900,Mon Jul 24 14:32:31 +0000 2017,7) Base effects. After such a big runup in tuition, it now doesn't take a big percentage increase to collect a lot more tuition dollars
889493297676390400,Mon Jul 24 14:31:42 +0000 2017,6) That points to more price-sensitive consumers, something that's backed by surveys.
889493199961690100,Mon Jul 24 14:31:19 +0000 2017,5) Enrollment shifts. Anecdotally, many private schools say more consumers willing to opt for cheaper public schools if price too high
889493002095407100,Mon Jul 24 14:30:32 +0000 2017,4) Also appears to be oversupply. # of colleges grew sharply from 1990s through 2010. Now, many -- namely for profit schools--closing
889492210768646100,Mon Jul 24 14:27:23 +0000 2017,3) Also, demographics. Lower birth rates are constraining pool of students. New h.s. grads rose roughly 18% 2000-2010 but up 2% this decade
889491873508839400,Mon Jul 24 14:26:03 +0000 2017,2) Lower demand. College enrollment over 4% this decade. Partly cyclical--when labor market is good, more would-be students opt to work
889491525272469500,Mon Jul 24 14:24:40 +0000 2017,1) College/grad-school tuition surged for decades but is now growing just under 2%. Many factors… https://t.co/4t8Rbtuuxv

755488500380635100,Tue Jul 19 19:44:29 +0000 2016,so constantly berating the media for citing high-balance defaulters is misplaced. they aren't the norm, for sure (5)
