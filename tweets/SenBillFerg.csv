846759299867164700,Tue Mar 28 16:22:03 +0000 2017,@morbrem @briangaither which is why no 10-mo shutdown not happening and rents are stabilized and why merchants have signed extended leases.
846759087685713900,Tue Mar 28 16:21:13 +0000 2017,@morbrem @briangaither you have every right to disagree with compromise. All 4 of us in 46th fought for tenants, that's just factual.

846754174641590300,Tue Mar 28 16:01:41 +0000 2017,@morbrem @briangaither it was pt of negotiation to get City's support for impact district. Again, part of legislating is compromise.
846752291977936900,Tue Mar 28 15:54:12 +0000 2017,@briangaither it's not on the floor yet, I don't think.
846751923642531800,Tue Mar 28 15:52:45 +0000 2017,@morbrem @briangaither but fundamentally, to suggest we haven't fought for concessions for merchants is inaccurate.
846751768910463000,Tue Mar 28 15:52:08 +0000 2017,@morbrem @briangaither we have tried to balance lots of interests. I understand if you disagree with compromise.
846751600836313100,Tue Mar 28 15:51:28 +0000 2017,@morbrem @briangaither we didn't negotiate operator deal. We created conditions for no shutdown, lower rents, and return of merchants.

845459785390735400,Sat Mar 25 02:18:15 +0000 2017,@morbrem the provision isn't to extinguish it, it's to protect it from being extinguished in 180 days.

845453019252711400,Sat Mar 25 01:51:22 +0000 2017,@morbrem you'd have to ask her. But she said it directly to me on at least 3 different occasions.

845451610432196600,Sat Mar 25 01:45:46 +0000 2017,@morbrem the legislation gives breathing room for whatever she decides to do.
845451512868491300,Sat Mar 25 01:45:23 +0000 2017,@morbrem she is on a monthly lease. For no cause, her lease could be non renewed next month. In which case she'd have 180 days to sell.
845451285943902200,Sat Mar 25 01:44:28 +0000 2017,@morbrem and that she wanted to sell asap. We created incentives for operator to purchase. Didn't force either side.
845451007022772200,Sat Mar 25 01:43:22 +0000 2017,@morbrem she expressly told us, as did her lawyer, that she wanted to sell her license. We added extra time to not force it be sold.
845443605280018400,Sat Mar 25 01:13:57 +0000 2017,@morbrem the entire point is that it doesn't force her, it gives her options.

845433239128997900,Sat Mar 25 00:32:46 +0000 2017,@morbrem @thompsonjuliet and we're giving her the ability to continue doing business and monetize her license as a separate asset.

761023517747884000,Thu Aug 04 02:18:40 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober totally agree.
761023011768053800,Thu Aug 04 02:16:39 +0000 2016,@DavidPontious @chris_merriam I think it's perfectly fair for someone to oppose the project or TIF. At some point it gets to a yes/no vote.
761022548993716200,Thu Aug 04 02:14:49 +0000 2016,@DavidPontious @chris_merriam I think focus on current vs new Council is misplaced focus. Timing more related to project length &amp; start.
761021756710596600,Thu Aug 04 02:11:40 +0000 2016,@DavidPontious @chris_merriam that's fair in the issuance of bonds. But the net impact of faster bond issuance doesn't change. Still set.
761021079322185700,Thu Aug 04 02:08:59 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober you absolutely cannot get better schools, safer neighborhoods AND lower taxes w/o increasing population.
761020818390261800,Thu Aug 04 02:07:56 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober I get the concerns. And I think there will be additional changes. But all those issues require growing population.
761020657681391600,Thu Aug 04 02:07:18 +0000 2016,@DavidPontious @chris_merriam @KarenDeCamp Harbor Point didn't impact school funding.
761020533827743700,Thu Aug 04 02:06:48 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober of course not. Incremental needed. But if we don't increase by 100k in next 25 years, City legitimately cannot sustain.
761019861136908300,Thu Aug 04 02:04:08 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober we have a city built for 1M ppl with 625k paying to maintain it. That simply doesn't work long term.
761019631347707900,Thu Aug 04 02:03:13 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober I'm much more concerned about the Administration consistently withholding funds from City Schools, like happened today.
761019448572518400,Thu Aug 04 02:02:30 +0000 2016,@chris_merriam @KarenDeCamp but it all goes to my bigger point of who determines best. Someone will be upset, regardless.
761019239318761500,Thu Aug 04 02:01:40 +0000 2016,@chris_merriam @KarenDeCamp that's a different point than their legal standing.
761018989833101300,Thu Aug 04 02:00:40 +0000 2016,@chris_merriam @KarenDeCamp I'm not demonizing anyone. I respect Karen immensely. I'm simply noting legal standing of legislative bodies.
761018728125337600,Thu Aug 04 01:59:38 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober the study is just that, a study. A formula comes out of a bill turned into law. Two very, very different things.
761018316961878000,Thu Aug 04 01:58:00 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober yes, and Baltimore City does not benefit by remaining poor.
761018079576895500,Thu Aug 04 01:57:03 +0000 2016,@KarenDeCamp on the point of hearings, yes, because that's the job. There is no new Council. There are party nominees.
761017876937486300,Thu Aug 04 01:56:15 +0000 2016,@KarenDeCamp I think it's clear the 1st offer was not taken. And it's still being debated and potentially altered. That's the process.
761017664764424200,Thu Aug 04 01:55:24 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober it's not MSDE. It's the state legislature.
761017149976551400,Thu Aug 04 01:53:22 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober we could and likely will calculate wealth change by year completely differently.
761017035857858600,Thu Aug 04 01:52:55 +0000 2016,@melissa_schober a hold harmless is virtually impossible with a ed formula reauthorization coming in 2 years.

761016432956088300,Thu Aug 04 01:50:31 +0000 2016,@KarenDeCamp extending the logic, basically they should pack up now and stop legislating. A term is a term.

758505033356804100,Thu Jul 28 03:31:06 +0000 2016,@ThBaltimoreChop @paulmgardner yup, and we did that this year for the next 3 years until we reauthorize the education funding formula.
758504838787240000,Thu Jul 28 03:30:20 +0000 2016,@paulmgardner you asked for $1. That was shown. Now, it's not good enough bc you say so. At what point do you actually mean what you say?
758504304114176000,Thu Jul 28 03:28:13 +0000 2016,@ThBaltimoreChop @paulmgardner we're talking ed funding formula. You can't have it both ways.
758504074622808000,Thu Jul 28 03:27:18 +0000 2016,@ThBaltimoreChop @paulmgardner fine, if value isn't created then BC not relatively more wealthy than other jurisdics and ed $ not impacted.

758501478709338100,Thu Jul 28 03:16:59 +0000 2016,@paulmgardner this is also not true. If value of property exceeds bond repayment, revenue goes to general fund. That's how TIFs work.
758501205689589800,Thu Jul 28 03:15:54 +0000 2016,@paulmgardner ok. How about a thirty year agreement with 6 neighborhoods worth a minimum of $39m. Not $1, $39m dollars.
758497594431582200,Thu Jul 28 03:01:33 +0000 2016,@paulmgardner accepting growth as a problem necessitates that Baltimore stay poor relative to state. That's not a winning strategy.

758427238987595800,Wed Jul 27 22:21:59 +0000 2016,Well, if you thought there wasn't much interest in Port Covington, you were wrong. Guessing about 450 at hearing. https://t.co/SL9xfSVRM1

758310999770431500,Wed Jul 27 14:40:05 +0000 2016,Hopefully we can all move forward to ensure that City Schools maximizes this opportunity. I know they can and they will.
758308926513418200,Wed Jul 27 14:31:51 +0000 2016,Now debating closure of Northwestern HS. State asks city to close buildings for less space, now complaining district is closing a school.
758307575716872200,Wed Jul 27 14:26:29 +0000 2016,Of course we should hold City Schools accountable for efficient spending. No question. But focusing on old problems is waste of time.
758306931824033800,Wed Jul 27 14:23:55 +0000 2016,We have real challenges w/ City Schools, I'll be 1st to admit, but we have to solve new problems, not harp on fixed issues of past.
758306647345365000,Wed Jul 27 14:22:48 +0000 2016,Unfortunately, our Comptroller at BPW this AM is raking City Schools over coals for problems that were fixed 18 months ago.
