681896671345692700,Tue Dec 29 17:56:50 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan so much Indian unis have still to learn. We have a long long way to go.
681896105710243800,Tue Dec 29 17:54:35 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan My fear too. I have actually seen this happening over 4 years. Shocking it was, when my friends and I realised it.
681895526984331300,Tue Dec 29 17:52:17 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan Hence the wait for 10-15 years, by when these younger ones will become influential enough.
681894813898158100,Tue Dec 29 17:49:27 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan Just director isn't enough. Senate blocks a lot of the changes. We have a non UoR director right now.
681894619735437300,Tue Dec 29 17:48:40 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan CE is the only saving grace for R in terms of anything national. Expected of course, based on history.
681894364117770200,Tue Dec 29 17:47:40 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan Basically the UoR influence has to die out.
681894276247113700,Tue Dec 29 17:47:19 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan There are a bunch of good, young profs. So I am partly hopeful for a change over next 10-15 years, if not more.
681894006549119000,Tue Dec 29 17:46:14 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan I think you and I will both agree on this: we can't expect R to be involved in something like this, for a variety of reasons.
681893667540348900,Tue Dec 29 17:44:53 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan I'm pretty sure they weren't. But the way they avoid taking stance anyway, I doubt they ever will be.
681893125174906900,Tue Dec 29 17:42:44 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan I don't think it's malicious either. I just don't expect R to take a stand, ever, on anything controversial.

681891060939767800,Tue Dec 29 17:34:32 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan WTH. Those 50+ other profs did not have classes and research? See the list, most are "technical people".
681890313435152400,Tue Dec 29 17:31:34 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan Ok. But I doubt these profs would release such statement on their own either. They are 10 of them, they can form a group too
681890037403746300,Tue Dec 29 17:30:28 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan Nope. Complaints were against torrents. They simply bought a filter and applied it, without caring about the consequence.
681889650168827900,Tue Dec 29 17:28:56 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan Also, I have direct info on how DC came about. SDSLabs brought it. There's been no change on the narrative from higher end.
681889361667866600,Tue Dec 29 17:27:47 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan They don't want any complaints of illegal activity (right in this). So they blocked majority of the internet. (totally wrong)
681888756169769000,Tue Dec 29 17:25:23 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan It's been some time since you left. NetNeutrality issue is new on national scale but censorship came to R recently.

681886573130952700,Tue Dec 29 17:16:42 +0000 2015,@sen_sushobhan There are 10 CSE profs in IITR. 50+ is a big number in comparison. IITR bureaucracy is _run_ by profs. So yes, there is...

487184476556894200,Thu Jul 10 10:40:05 +0000 2014,@AbhishekChou that's where I disagree. I think when there is no successful model, there is nothing to replicate.
487183413049192450,Thu Jul 10 10:35:51 +0000 2014,@AbhishekChou Disagree. The right step would have been to make the newer 8 IITs and older 7 world class before expanding

487181665521778700,Thu Jul 10 10:28:55 +0000 2014,@AbhishekChou the older IITs themselves need major restructuring, so there is no model to replicate in the first place.
