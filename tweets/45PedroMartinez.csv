920495052505444400,Wed Oct 18 03:41:37 +0000 2017,The Cubs look tired. They don’t have any energy and that’s the first thing you need in the postseason

919773902112526300,Mon Oct 16 03:56:01 +0000 2017,Girardi needs good pitching now more than ever. He needs Sabathia to hold the Astros for enough innings, till the team makes some runs
919773391464386600,Mon Oct 16 03:53:59 +0000 2017,My daddy is the man with the red hair #Dodgers #Turner https://t.co/OiC9oQwvzg
919773052656697300,Mon Oct 16 03:52:38 +0000 2017,For Lackey he said he had no excuses, he just missed location. I like that. No excuses. He gave it up, nothing else.
919772436446498800,Mon Oct 16 03:50:12 +0000 2017,As a player you have to be ready to do anything for your team, specially during playoffs! You need to have your cleats on!
919771113432993800,Mon Oct 16 03:44:56 +0000 2017,@Dodgers have great arms in that bullpen. Maeda is a rookie pitcher but a veteran in Japan and knows how to attack hitters
919770823640191000,Mon Oct 16 03:43:47 +0000 2017,Turner plays with a bit of a chip on his shoulder. He reminds me a lot of @garysheffield , playing the game with the same intensity
919769303758639100,Mon Oct 16 03:37:45 +0000 2017,I think the turning point of the game was when Lester pitched to Turner on the 5th. I would have walked him, and faced Bellinger
919766124023119900,Mon Oct 16 03:25:07 +0000 2017,It’s late in the season, Davis have been used a lot, he might need some stretching or some extra time to recover
919765758456029200,Mon Oct 16 03:23:39 +0000 2017,I think Davis is not totally healthy; I didn’t like the way he looked last game. That might be the reason why Maddon didn’t use him tonight
919704701809000400,Sun Oct 15 23:21:02 +0000 2017,With Lester on the mound hopefully the Cubs can turn the page around and get in the winning circle
919696131852038100,Sun Oct 15 22:46:59 +0000 2017,When you compare today’s Cubs and Dodgers line ups, both are equally as good, but Roberts makes a huge difference, because he’s a mastermind
919421262354673700,Sun Oct 15 04:34:45 +0000 2017,Mi hermano Yasiel Puig @YasielPuig todo un orgullo cubano y latino con el bate en esta serie!
919420694869487600,Sun Oct 15 04:32:30 +0000 2017,But Dave Roberts also deserves to be a DADDY tonight; his decisions and moves tonight gave his team the W!!
919420385912873000,Sun Oct 15 04:31:16 +0000 2017,What Justin Verlander did today reminds me a lot of the great things that happened to me!! He is the DADDY of the night
919418204690288600,Sun Oct 15 04:22:36 +0000 2017,At this point in his career, Verlander knows how to combine his stuff.  He’s a veteran and he’s enjoying his maturity in baseball
919417332937740300,Sun Oct 15 04:19:08 +0000 2017,The injury Verlander had, has forced him to become more of a finesse pitcher that a power pitcher.
919416418675970000,Sun Oct 15 04:15:30 +0000 2017,Anybody that loves baseball loves fundamentals, and enjoys watching them being executed
919416238236987400,Sun Oct 15 04:14:47 +0000 2017,The rule that was applied in tonight’s game was ok; but it takes away the emotion from the game and the fans

919352231400497200,Sun Oct 15 00:00:27 +0000 2017,When you face a tough hitter you have to respect what he’s doing, but try to find a way to stop him from doing more damage
919351430921769000,Sat Oct 14 23:57:16 +0000 2017,Kershaw will be facing a hitting team in the Cubs. They could ambush him, but I think his concentration level will be high tonight
919350625212731400,Sat Oct 14 23:54:04 +0000 2017,I’m expecting Kershaw to do great things tonight. His stuff was crispy on his last outing
919348634445066200,Sat Oct 14 23:46:09 +0000 2017,Adversities make you or break you  The Cubs have been through a lot and that is just making them show resiliency
919348420569194500,Sat Oct 14 23:45:18 +0000 2017,I’m not worried about the amount of pitches Quintana made. I’m more concerned with his mindset, knowing his wife is not completely ok

918707671393476600,Fri Oct 13 05:19:12 +0000 2017,Dusty lift up your head my man!! You did an outstanding job with the Nationals!!
918705208762314800,Fri Oct 13 05:09:25 +0000 2017,Davis got gutsy, and his breaking ball got sharper. He got a little breather at the end with the play review, and was able to get the 3 outs

918628454593069000,Fri Oct 13 00:04:25 +0000 2017,I see a balanced line up in the Cubs. I think they have to create situations by making more contact, specially in the middle of the line up
918624863698522100,Thu Oct 12 23:50:09 +0000 2017,Didi’s a late bloomer and now he understands the game better. People say that we, the players from the islands develop later. Might be true
918623306034577400,Thu Oct 12 23:43:58 +0000 2017,Taylor seems to be really focused and he’s doing the little things he has to do. Without Werth on the line up, I would move him up to hit
918621005056217100,Thu Oct 12 23:34:49 +0000 2017,Now that the Nationals found a small hole in Rizzo’s swing, they will try to do damage, but they still have to be cautious
918617119327162400,Thu Oct 12 23:19:22 +0000 2017,Scherzer knows that his contributions might be limited tonight but he could make a difference. I just hope he doesn’t come in too early

918282140306915300,Thu Oct 12 01:08:17 +0000 2017,As a veteran, my best advice to Strasburg is to remember that the better you do, the more expectations you build on people’s mind
918273431308775400,Thu Oct 12 00:33:41 +0000 2017,Felicito a Strasburg por la tremenda salida de hoy. Este es el tipo de lanzador que sabemos que es, y hoy lo demostró!

916899352215457800,Sun Oct 08 05:33:35 +0000 2017,I think Scherzer won’t try to over do anything. Infielders will be watching out for defensive plays to back him up, in case he needs it
916898249872683000,Sun Oct 08 05:29:12 +0000 2017,Greinke will need 100 % concentration, 100 % control and 100 % of his stuff to be on point to beat the Dodgers

915799928479404000,Thu Oct 05 04:44:52 +0000 2017,At this point Kershaw knows his body enough to understand what it means to compete and to be successful in the playoffs

915682827550806000,Wed Oct 04 20:59:33 +0000 2017,My main concern in a playoff game was to realize what I had. I would be calmed, but I wanted to finish quick and get you out quick
915681828538916900,Wed Oct 04 20:55:35 +0000 2017,I don’t disregard the importance of a play off game but you have to keep your composure.
915676731675217900,Wed Oct 04 20:35:19 +0000 2017,Severino is full of talent, but the inexperience in the playoffs didn't help him execute. He needed to slow down a bit, but he'll be fine

900135694013800400,Tue Aug 22 23:20:47 +0000 2017,Los Cubs tuvieron la oportunidad de enterrar a cualquier equipo y no lo hicieron. Han disminuido el paso y eso le puede costar caro
900135289087307800,Tue Aug 22 23:19:11 +0000 2017,Como está Joey Votto cualquier lanzador debe ser cuidadoso. El se cobrará cualquier error que cometa un pitcher
900134113407094800,Tue Aug 22 23:14:30 +0000 2017,Someone like Jhon Lackey needs to step up and pitch a bit better. The Cubs bullpen has struggled a bit lately

900128508353151000,Tue Aug 22 22:52:14 +0000 2017,As a pitcher if you are going to nibble around a hitter you have to know what you're doing and to whom you're doing it
900126549265055700,Tue Aug 22 22:44:27 +0000 2017,In any situation where I see Votto coming up, he is not getting anything to hit. If you make a mistake he is going to make you pay.

872966122332713000,Thu Jun 08 23:58:37 +0000 2017,If a pitcher becomes predictable hitters will ambush him.
872961989743697900,Thu Jun 08 23:42:11 +0000 2017,I don't see the make up, presence  or confidence I saw in Gerrit Cole before, specially during play offs
872958931714310100,Thu Jun 08 23:30:02 +0000 2017,The history in Boston has always been the same. Boston is a small town and the Sox are the number one team. The attention is always there
872958438543945700,Thu Jun 08 23:28:05 +0000 2017,I think Price need to realize that who he in Boston is going to draw attention. He just has to keep his answers honest with the media.
872951069285986300,Thu Jun 08 22:58:48 +0000 2017,After a big game like a no-hitter, you just have to try to take whatever was working for you and execute it on the next game

872303081723134000,Wed Jun 07 04:03:55 +0000 2017,If I noticed a hitter didn't like a pitch around an area over the plate, I would go back to that same area.
872300481816784900,Wed Jun 07 03:53:36 +0000 2017,La tendencia del béisbol llevará a ver lanzadores pasando menos tiempo en el montículo, pero brazos con mayor velocidad
872299968777908200,Wed Jun 07 03:51:33 +0000 2017,Scherzer has the stuff to strike out 20 today: Nasty slider, great movement on change up, fastball 97 and above, and location is on point
872299834862129200,Wed Jun 07 03:51:01 +0000 2017,Tanaka tiene la idea correcta de lo que quiere lanzar, pero no la esta ejecutando como quiere.
872298316301783000,Wed Jun 07 03:44:59 +0000 2017,I lived everyone of those pitches that Kimbrel pitched today to closed down the Yanks. It reminded me of my days at Yankee Stadium
872298121115709400,Wed Jun 07 03:44:13 +0000 2017,Tanaka has the right idea of what to pitch, but he is not executing it the way he wants it.
872297993516572700,Wed Jun 07 03:43:42 +0000 2017,Bush has what he needs to be the closer for the Texas Rangers
872295401143009300,Wed Jun 07 03:33:24 +0000 2017,The way baseball is trending you'll see a lot less pitchers going for 200 k, spending less time on the mound, but having more velocity.
872294992068399100,Wed Jun 07 03:31:47 +0000 2017,The Nationals have the best offense out there right now
872294844286345200,Wed Jun 07 03:31:11 +0000 2017,Brandon McCarty has a hard time staying healthy. He pitches great when healthy, but he's not a sure bet.
871955461402239000,Tue Jun 06 05:02:36 +0000 2017,Marcell Ozuna is the best available bat for me when you talk best trade bats; he can hit, steal and throw.
871948388434137100,Tue Jun 06 04:34:30 +0000 2017,Talking draft and Hunter Greene's arm #draft2017 https://t.co/BeRx96mfwT
871938942681182200,Tue Jun 06 03:56:58 +0000 2017,I think a very aggressive Arizona D-backs team worked in  favor of Volzquez because they wanted to swing, and he worked around that.
871938625558196200,Tue Jun 06 03:55:42 +0000 2017,Volquez realized he didn't have his best stuff so he relied on location during the non hitter.
871935120684589000,Tue Jun 06 03:41:47 +0000 2017,Quizás es tiempo para los Yankees entrar en pánico acerca de Tanaka. Sus lanzamientos no están ahi y no  le veo mejoría en lo inmediato.
871934250798526500,Tue Jun 06 03:38:19 +0000 2017,No dije que David regresará, sino que el se mantiene en forma porque se ejercita y que los Red Sox pudieran usar una ayudita de su bate.
871933559497424900,Tue Jun 06 03:35:34 +0000 2017,I think is time to panic about Tanaka. His stuff is not there, that eastern division is really tough; I don't see him getting any better
871930638479364100,Tue Jun 06 03:23:58 +0000 2017,I think Schwarber will start making adjustments in the league. There's is no need to panic.
871928217275437000,Tue Jun 06 03:14:21 +0000 2017,I didn't say David is making a come back, I said David is in baseball shape because he works out, and the team could use a swing or two.
871927947879428100,Tue Jun 06 03:13:17 +0000 2017,Pitchers are the only ones that use everything from their last hair to their last nail of the body to do what they do.
871925114476146700,Tue Jun 06 03:02:01 +0000 2017,The worse thing for a pitcher is when you feel good to go out there and do your thing, and then you feel that pinch in your arm.

871922410274115600,Tue Jun 06 02:51:16 +0000 2017,The Astros are a young team, they are loaded and they are here to stay.
871922028617637900,Tue Jun 06 02:49:45 +0000 2017,I'm not worried about Michael Franco because of the situation that Philadelphia is in, but they need to find out what is wrong with this kid
871919202537525200,Tue Jun 06 02:38:32 +0000 2017,I think the Yankees will have a bit of a fight with the Red Sox, and the Orioles have a bit of space to get better.
871917143377551400,Tue Jun 06 02:30:21 +0000 2017,Big Papi is working out, and I know he is in baseball shape, and the @RedSox could use a bit of his bat.
871916847435841500,Tue Jun 06 02:29:10 +0000 2017,Montgomery doesn't change his pose on the mound regardless of the situation. He has the same demeanor, WS or not; regular season or not
871916630384758800,Tue Jun 06 02:28:18 +0000 2017,I am surprised to see Samardzija struggle, when I see the kind of stuff he has and what he's capable of doing
871912562195128300,Tue Jun 06 02:12:08 +0000 2017,The Astros are really similar to the Cubs; they have everything they need to win it.
871912197273866200,Tue Jun 06 02:10:41 +0000 2017,I think Carlos Martinez got a little bit too relaxed on the 7th inning; didn't look to me as intense as he was earlier in the game.

860330696140783600,Fri May 05 03:09:56 +0000 2017,I'm not concerned with Victor Martinez. He is too good of a hitter to struggle for an entire season. He knows how to hit.
860330529392078800,Fri May 05 03:09:17 +0000 2017,I am concerned with Alex Gordon in KC. Every since he got hurt he has declined and is a steady decline.
860330329940406300,Fri May 05 03:08:29 +0000 2017,You don't land a plane hard, and so is for pitching; when you land quietly you control your head. When you land fast, your head bounces.

859927827097014300,Thu May 04 00:29:05 +0000 2017,Something must be wrong in the way the Mets train their players. Something needs to be change and needs to be look at.
859926774750335000,Thu May 04 00:24:54 +0000 2017,It seems like every year the Mets are bitten by the bug of injuries.

859630922324480000,Wed May 03 04:49:17 +0000 2017,The reason why Harvey might be missing location is because it's unusual for him to be so far across his body.
859630625250312200,Wed May 03 04:48:06 +0000 2017,Harvey is doing a different landing this year with his front leg. He is kicking across his body and he looks uncomfortable.
859630355132944400,Wed May 03 04:47:02 +0000 2017,Pitching is all about timing and rhythm. Sometimes us pitchers just need to make small adjustments, invisible to the normal eye.

859610716919267300,Wed May 03 03:29:00 +0000 2017,Nunca pensé que esa rotación tan joven de los Mets se lastimarían tan temprano. No se qué pasa con los Mets y las lesiones.
859610237363515400,Wed May 03 03:27:06 +0000 2017,I never thought that the nucleus of young Mets  pitchers were going to get hurt so early. I'm not sure what's up with the Mets and injuries.
859609751860150300,Wed May 03 03:25:10 +0000 2017,Machado is not going to get thrown at in tomorrow's game. #oriolesvsredsox
859607397077332000,Wed May 03 03:15:48 +0000 2017,Machado and E-Rodriguez came up in the same organization on all levels. I don think he threw at him intentionally either.
859607094894489600,Wed May 03 03:14:36 +0000 2017,Machado se siente señalado por lo que hizo, y entiendo que no merece la persecución, por eso debe mantenerse hablando con su bate
859603552079163400,Wed May 03 03:00:32 +0000 2017,Chris Sale ya está sobrepasando muchas de las cosas que hice con los Medias Rojas
859601219517415400,Wed May 03 02:51:16 +0000 2017,But, I don't think Chris Sale had any intention of hurting anybody. #soxvsorioles
859599770364588000,Wed May 03 02:45:30 +0000 2017,Machado feels singled out because what he did doesn't deserve the persecution he is getting. But he can't allow this to get to his head.
859599458820083700,Wed May 03 02:44:16 +0000 2017,At this point there isn't going to be one thing that will go undetected between Orioles and Red Sox; it's baseball.

852738190133780500,Fri Apr 14 04:20:02 +0000 2017,Los Rockies de Colorado tienen mucho talento joven en su rotación, y su bullpen puede mejorar mucho.
852737866887188500,Fri Apr 14 04:18:45 +0000 2017,Britton tiene uno de los sinkers más temibles en todo beisbol, y eso no es fácil para un catcher
852737614117351400,Fri Apr 14 04:17:44 +0000 2017,The Colorado Rockies have a lot of talent in that young rotation. Their bullpen has a chance to get a lot better.
852737145085190100,Fri Apr 14 04:15:53 +0000 2017,Britton has one of the hottest sinkers in all of baseball. Not easy for a catcher.
852732425251676200,Fri Apr 14 03:57:07 +0000 2017,The Royals might have to panic a bit, because they have guys like Hosmer as free agent this year. I hope they don't disintegrate the team.
852731181313302500,Fri Apr 14 03:52:11 +0000 2017,The Jays should panic a bit, I am not seeing the same atmosphere in the team that I saw two years ago. Not sure what is going on.
852727209949134800,Fri Apr 14 03:36:24 +0000 2017,Un lanzador debe aprender a lanzar lanzamientos de calidad aunque este debajo en el conteo
852726864569397200,Fri Apr 14 03:35:02 +0000 2017,Orgulloso de ver cómo Severino se manejo en el juego hoy. Su recta estuvo estable y mantuvo su compostura todo el tiempo

852568118987821000,Thu Apr 13 17:04:14 +0000 2017,Al inicio de la temporada, le toma más tiempo a los lanzadores acostumbrarse al agarre de la pelota, que a los bateadores el ritmo del swing
852388067491147800,Thu Apr 13 05:08:46 +0000 2017,Hitters that track the ball can make a pitcher labor a lot more. That is uncomfortable for the pitcher
852385889988866000,Thu Apr 13 05:00:07 +0000 2017,It normally takes longer for pitchers to get the feel for their pitches than for batters to get their swing going
852385353570955300,Thu Apr 13 04:57:59 +0000 2017,I think Dyson and the Rangers don't need to panic just yet. After Spring Training it takes a few days for players to settle and adjust
852377447089795100,Thu Apr 13 04:26:34 +0000 2017,I don't care that you throw 100 mph.  If you are pitching middle away in the strike zone you are not intimidating me as a hitter.
852377259537289200,Thu Apr 13 04:25:49 +0000 2017,Shelby Miller looking good today, but I am shocked that a guy that throws 98 is not pitching closer to the hitter and then high in the SZ

851988934213206000,Wed Apr 12 02:42:45 +0000 2017,I am not sure what the Pittsburgh organization pitching strategy is, but it has worked. The pitchers have felt comfortable and confident
851988684467470300,Wed Apr 12 02:41:46 +0000 2017,The pitching coach deserves all the credit for making them believe they can have success without pushing the issue too much.
851987955141005300,Wed Apr 12 02:38:52 +0000 2017,Many pitchers that have been with the Pittsburgh organization come out with a confidence boost due to pitching coach. Liriano, Nova,Volquez
851975777549779000,Wed Apr 12 01:50:28 +0000 2017,Is about time for Happ to mature and understand what he needs to do. He has that deception as he pitches, and the ball jumps at the hitter

788830946229223400,Wed Oct 19 19:55:28 +0000 2016,#Lindor can adjust to the breaking ball and the fastball, according to how you pitch to him #postseason
788829874282565600,Wed Oct 19 19:51:12 +0000 2016,The #Jays have the report on Merritt but they don't necessarily know what he's capable of doing. In the #postseason is where heroes are made
788828303444418600,Wed Oct 19 19:44:57 +0000 2016,As a pitcher, Merritt is very deceiving; he relies on his breaking ball and knows how to hide the ball, but can also get a fastball by you.
788827990146756600,Wed Oct 19 19:43:43 +0000 2016,If I was Merritt, I would come out with a chip on my shoulder and try to prove everybody wrong.
788243035884777500,Tue Oct 18 04:59:19 +0000 2016,My friend Terry Francona surprised all of us tonight. For that, he is my DADDY for the night!… https://t.co/oS9fzpQUkF
788242428952137700,Tue Oct 18 04:56:54 +0000 2016,Todos los movimientos que Francona ha hecho le están saliendo a su favor, y el equipo los esta ejecutando a la perfección
788241361124286500,Tue Oct 18 04:52:39 +0000 2016,Los Indios de Cleveland tienen un gran futuro. Después de que Bauer salió, esos brazos jóvenes del bullpen se echaron arriba ese juego
788240578899157000,Tue Oct 18 04:49:33 +0000 2016,Era cuestión de tiempo para #Kershaw hiciera algo extraordinario en la #postemporada. Ese muchacho da grandeza por todos los lados
788240328629166100,Tue Oct 18 04:48:33 +0000 2016,Los #BlueJays no han podido capitalizar con hombres en base.

788233121334333400,Tue Oct 18 04:19:55 +0000 2016,Kershaw is greatness; it was just a matter of time before he did something super special in the #postseason #Dodgers #Kershaw
788232842857766900,Tue Oct 18 04:18:49 +0000 2016,Kluber's pitching tomorrow might be the reason for the #BlueJays to feel frustration. By now, he knows what that lineup will try to do
788229065010401300,Tue Oct 18 04:03:48 +0000 2016,I see a bright future for the #ClevelandIndians. After Bauer left, all those young arms came out and picked up the win. #Kudos to them
788228803784912900,Tue Oct 18 04:02:46 +0000 2016,It's impressive to see these young nucleus of players playing like they are, under Terry's leadership. #ClevelandIndians

787436532365832200,Sat Oct 15 23:34:33 +0000 2016,If Bauer wants to be on top of his game, Toronto is the right place. My only concern would be his finger and how fast he has healed
787433792256421900,Sat Oct 15 23:23:40 +0000 2016,I am gonna call Andrew Miller, "Wipe-out" #Miller #postseason

787381700288405500,Sat Oct 15 19:56:40 +0000 2016,En el pasado no existía la tecnología para ver los errores en una jugada. Ahora todos pueden verlos y convertirse en árbitro desde fuera
787381137559523300,Sat Oct 15 19:54:26 +0000 2016,Hay árbitros que no pueden estar en algunas situaciones. Lazaro Diaz es inconsistente en su zona de strike, y eso confunde los pitchers.
787380230302277600,Sat Oct 15 19:50:50 +0000 2016,Back in the day you didn't have the technology to see mistakes. Now everybody can be an umpire from the outside, and mistakes are evident
787379978253893600,Sat Oct 15 19:49:50 +0000 2016,Some umpires aren't ready to be in situations. I think Lazaro Diaz is not consistent about his calls. I have a problem with inconsistency.
787378809171423200,Sat Oct 15 19:45:11 +0000 2016,The Indians did an outstanding job maintaining what they were doing.
787378472519815200,Sat Oct 15 19:43:51 +0000 2016,As a pitcher, a quick worker can get the game going; it disrupts the hitter's timing.

787146430414630900,Sat Oct 15 04:21:48 +0000 2016,Es impresionante ver a Francisco Lindor jugar como todo un veterano, siendo tan joven. #posttemporada
787139990664859600,Sat Oct 15 03:56:12 +0000 2016,The most impressive thing I saw Kluber, Miller and Allen do was staying away from the happy zone. They were executing to perfection.

787082607334862800,Sat Oct 15 00:08:11 +0000 2016,That is the value of Ramirez, he can field any position, he's a switch hitter and has hit  500 in the post season.
787082036108419100,Sat Oct 15 00:05:55 +0000 2016,Coming home to this fan-base is the best thing that could have happened to the Cleveland Indians. Nothing like being home!

784551727139815400,Sat Oct 08 00:31:22 +0000 2016,Kluber executed his plan to perfection. He was aware of the things he wanted to do and rose to the occasion #postseason
784550985486204900,Sat Oct 08 00:28:25 +0000 2016,Corey Kluber had the perfect presence of mind and focus that you need in a #postseason pitcher
784444763021779000,Fri Oct 07 17:26:20 +0000 2016,Hay que usar contra los bateadores lo mismo que le está funcionando pero contra. Hay que quitarle el chance de que te perjudiquen temprano
784437178910724100,Fri Oct 07 16:56:12 +0000 2016,As a pitcher, you have to take away from the hitters, what has been working for them. Take away the opportunity to hurt you early
784436249436098600,Fri Oct 07 16:52:30 +0000 2016,To face that #Jays powerhouse you have to force them to go after pitches. But for that, the pitcher needs to command the zone.
784435919877058600,Fri Oct 07 16:51:12 +0000 2016,Donaldson, Encarnacion and Bautista are full of confidence. I would pitch around the plate, away from the plate.
784435762452308000,Fri Oct 07 16:50:34 +0000 2016,I want to see Darvish establish himself right away on the 1st inning. He should command his three pitches, specially the breaking ball.
784433915943526400,Fri Oct 07 16:43:14 +0000 2016,Although I would've love to see Darvish pitch a bit closer to the end, he can neutralize the #Jays power with his breaking ball pitches.
784433649856819200,Fri Oct 07 16:42:10 +0000 2016,I like the DARVISH-JAYS matchup, as he can spin the ball on either side, and throw the 4 seam fastball. He can have success in this game

784126724502020100,Thu Oct 06 20:22:34 +0000 2016,Adrian Beltre is so reliable and makes everyone feel relaxed. He has an insurance policy on Carlos Beltran in that lineup.
784126614577655800,Thu Oct 06 20:22:07 +0000 2016,This game is too important for the #Jays to retaliate. They just have to assure a win, and take this first game away from the #Rangers

783522826024263700,Wed Oct 05 04:22:53 +0000 2016,But kudos to him, as he was able to redeem himself from that one little mistake that put him behind in the game.
783522198971641900,Wed Oct 05 04:20:24 +0000 2016,Stroman exceeded the expectations I had of him. I didn't see him as the Stroman I saw last year, when he was more aggressive.

783518021520326700,Wed Oct 05 04:03:48 +0000 2016,Showalter ran out of choices
783517883448123400,Wed Oct 05 04:03:15 +0000 2016,Why pitch to Encarnacion with the winning run on third base, and the bases open?
783517699456528400,Wed Oct 05 04:02:31 +0000 2016,Showalter utilizó todos los recursos correctos, y los Orioles jugaron fuerte. Lo único que cuestiono es que Ubaldo le lanzara a Encarnación
783516036813484000,Wed Oct 05 03:55:54 +0000 2016,Showalter hit all the right buttons tonight and the Orioles played hard. The only thing I second guess is Ubaldo pitching to Encarnacion

783457048658796500,Wed Oct 05 00:01:30 +0000 2016,If the Jays want to have a lefty or a righty out there is fine, but just don't say anything about your pitchers. Excuses make things worse.
783455998597996500,Tue Oct 04 23:57:20 +0000 2016,I would flip Adam Jones and put him on no. 2 spot, so they have a natural lead off hitter, that doesn't have the tendency to just swing

781625328137568300,Thu Sep 29 22:42:54 +0000 2016,With Ortiz you cannot stay too long with a fastball, or a change up, or a slider.  You rarely find a tall guy that is able to pull the ball
781625023597535200,Thu Sep 29 22:41:42 +0000 2016,David is a headache for someone that doesn't command more than 3 pitches. If you can't overpower him, better not face it.
781353108513361900,Thu Sep 29 04:41:12 +0000 2016,The separation that Arenado has built from the rest of the league is huge, in terms of numbers.
781350304528957400,Thu Sep 29 04:30:04 +0000 2016,Arrieta has as good as numbers as Lester and Hendricks. He also has presence, stamina and pitchability
781347287247233000,Thu Sep 29 04:18:04 +0000 2016,As an opposing pitcher, when you look at the Red Sox lineup up and down, it has to give you a little bit of a headache.
781344644592504800,Thu Sep 29 04:07:34 +0000 2016,I think Michael Fulmer should win rookie of the year. I love my boy Gary, but Fulmer has been there all year, and he deserves it.
781344220309295100,Thu Sep 29 04:05:53 +0000 2016,I don't think anybody wants to go on the field and embarrass himself in front of 40,000 thousand fans. I always respected my teammates
781344045096398800,Thu Sep 29 04:05:11 +0000 2016,When pitching in a tight game, you have to just compete against the other team and try not to worry about what the hitters are going to do.
781340177927209000,Thu Sep 29 03:49:49 +0000 2016,Price has been in post season scenarios more than Porcello has; he is s suited for that situation, he will give you an opportunity to win.
781339784144969700,Thu Sep 29 03:48:15 +0000 2016,I think Porcello feels comfortable being second in the rotation. I think it should stayed like that. If is not broken, don't fix it.
781339524618195000,Thu Sep 29 03:47:13 +0000 2016,David Price is the guy who was brought over to start game one in post season, and he knows it and the Red Sox too.
781337223719428100,Thu Sep 29 03:38:05 +0000 2016,I am extremely happy for Tim Tebow, and the kind of influence he is having over his teammates. He is a hard worker and is fighting for it
781331437786202100,Thu Sep 29 03:15:05 +0000 2016,Teixeira messed up the night for the Sox. He was just like a fly in the middle of your soup. He just messed up a good dinner.
781331184269848600,Thu Sep 29 03:14:05 +0000 2016,Miggy Cabrera has to be one of the most exciting guys to watch. Is almost like he hits the opposite way whenever he wants to
781317840863387600,Thu Sep 29 02:21:04 +0000 2016,What really hits me about Jose Fernandez's death is how easily it could have been prevented. Youth and inexperience in the water, got him.

780926969248682000,Wed Sep 28 00:27:53 +0000 2016,Porcello has been able to relax, and not be as pressured, pitching behind David Price. He has been a consistent arm on the rotation
780923902587506700,Wed Sep 28 00:15:41 +0000 2016,Instead of challenging hitters, King Felix just need to know how to mix his pitches. He has great, great stuff
780922790723653600,Wed Sep 28 00:11:16 +0000 2016,King Felix is well respected already in the league. He can use the experience he has to make quality pitches and expand the strike zone.
780922632879345700,Wed Sep 28 00:10:39 +0000 2016,The Cardinals need to beat teams like the Reds. They need Wainwright to do good tonight.
780912630793838600,Tue Sep 27 23:30:54 +0000 2016,Ok guys you got me... *dugout got it
780900180463906800,Tue Sep 27 22:41:26 +0000 2016,I am not ready to hand anybody the National's Cy Young vote yet. I like Lester, but it will really all depend on tonight's outings.
780898731931668500,Tue Sep 27 22:35:40 +0000 2016,Wilson Ramos's lost is bad, because he knew how to handle situation and pitchers.
780898304884367400,Tue Sep 27 22:33:58 +0000 2016,Joaquin Benoit's injury is a blow for the Toronto Blue Jays. They still need to win every game they can.
780898085442580500,Tue Sep 27 22:33:06 +0000 2016,I don't see the energy in the Baltimore's dog out. They are not as energetic as they were in the beginning of the season
780895228760887300,Tue Sep 27 22:21:45 +0000 2016,When we play together we call the team the true family. We end up spending more time with our teammates than with our own family.
780085774129762300,Sun Sep 25 16:45:16 +0000 2016,Is hard for me to believe that this day is going on. I understand really how the Fernandez family must feel about losing this young baby.

769373588897935400,Sat Aug 27 03:18:52 +0000 2016,I think Mattingly has done an outstanding job with the Florida Marlins
769373333314043900,Sat Aug 27 03:17:51 +0000 2016,When you teach a pitcher you teach him to throw the ball. When you teach a knuckleballer you teach them to guide the ball.
769364354185596900,Sat Aug 27 02:42:10 +0000 2016,At this time of year you start to hear the names of familiar teams, Kansas City, the Giants, the Blue Jays.... My oh my
769364166347853800,Sat Aug 27 02:41:26 +0000 2016,Mookie Betts and Altuve will have a tight race for the MVP in the AL
768676048192073700,Thu Aug 25 05:07:05 +0000 2016,My final strike of the night is for Rich Hill and the great game he pitched tonight for the LA Dodgers!! 👏🏽👏🏽
768668725880975400,Thu Aug 25 04:38:00 +0000 2016,When you decide to go for surgery you have to start from zero. I think Tanaka is being smart about remaking himself with other alternatives
768662810716999700,Thu Aug 25 04:14:29 +0000 2016,I really hope my compadre David continues to elevate the standard of the DH in the Majors and probes to everyone he is an HOF to be.
768662575118635000,Thu Aug 25 04:13:33 +0000 2016,The AL MVP candidate for me would be Edwin Encarnacion. He has done a great job for the Blue Jays and has filled Batista's absence
768656363446759400,Thu Aug 25 03:48:52 +0000 2016,Sanchez has different approaches to different pitches and pitchers. He is getting those at bats like a true veteran @ElGarySanchez
768656084970209300,Thu Aug 25 03:47:46 +0000 2016,I am jumping on the band wagon for Gary Sanchez @ElGarySanchez for the respect he is getting at such a young age.
768655867784884200,Thu Aug 25 03:46:54 +0000 2016,Gary Sanchez is a big kid with a lot of power. He reminds me a lot of Albert Pujols.
768653737493602300,Thu Aug 25 03:38:26 +0000 2016,I believe the NL MVP has to go to Arenado! This kid is hitting consistently at home and on the road.
768653621017714700,Thu Aug 25 03:37:58 +0000 2016,When young players get a bit too comfortable in the Majors, they can get too relaxed. When that happens, they tend to lose focus.
768653290787655700,Thu Aug 25 03:36:40 +0000 2016,Francouer brings a really good defense to the Marlins team, and he has that veteran presence in the clubhouse with younger players
768650330653487100,Thu Aug 25 03:24:54 +0000 2016,Cespedes just needs to sit still, and keep himself quite, and see what happens with the Mets.
768649834366632000,Thu Aug 25 03:22:55 +0000 2016,If I was Cespedes I would be cautious about opting out of the Mets deal. There is too many good position players around.
768646412439388200,Thu Aug 25 03:09:20 +0000 2016,Baseball has a dark part and that is the business of arbitration and negotiation.
768646148689047600,Thu Aug 25 03:08:17 +0000 2016,It doesn't matter how much you love a team, you don't ever express it publicly as a player. Unfortunately, that can affect negotiations.
768639471378133000,Thu Aug 25 02:41:45 +0000 2016,Martinez is pacing himself a bit as a pitcher. He knows when to add and when to subtract and has learned to save some energy

768310126608470000,Wed Aug 24 04:53:03 +0000 2016,I don't see the Yankees with the energy to surpass the other teams in contention.
768309809707782100,Wed Aug 24 04:51:47 +0000 2016,I don't think teams will pursue the 7-year contract pattern with pitchers that are beyond 30, except with role model ones, and special ones
768306987306102800,Wed Aug 24 04:40:34 +0000 2016,I think Arrieta is not having a bad year, he's just slowing down. In the years before he got us all pampered with his outstanding pitching
768304649661128700,Wed Aug 24 04:31:17 +0000 2016,I love what's happening with Ivan Nova as he's having a new change of scenery with the Pirates
768304494421561300,Wed Aug 24 04:30:40 +0000 2016,When you face a team too often you have to switch signs at least every two innings. Having a different set of signs confuses the other team
768304270940577800,Wed Aug 24 04:29:47 +0000 2016,When you face a team a lot, like the Dodgers and the Giants do, gotta to bring something new everytime, and be cautious against each other
767947110356553700,Tue Aug 23 04:50:33 +0000 2016,Duffy is a game one starter. The last eleven outings, he has been is 8-0
767944290819514400,Tue Aug 23 04:39:21 +0000 2016,Danny Duffy is probably the hottest pitcher in the AL right now
767936978822324200,Tue Aug 23 04:10:17 +0000 2016,Rodney has the best change up in the Big Leagues. When he is healthy, he just needs to build confidence
767936628211998700,Tue Aug 23 04:08:54 +0000 2016,I liked what I saw from David Price tonight. He used his change up a bit more and kept low on the strike zone. Fastball looked better
767512313624719400,Mon Aug 22 00:02:49 +0000 2016,My perfect pitcher would be made of:  Legs:Roger Clemens  Heart:Jhon Smoltz  Arm: Nolan Ryan Brain: Greg Maddux Intensity: Randy Jhonson
767510389580062700,Sun Aug 21 23:55:11 +0000 2016,When I saw Roger Clemens's mechanics, my eyes lid up as a young boy. He had great leg work
767508506589225000,Sun Aug 21 23:47:42 +0000 2016,Since I was a fast pitcher, it frustrates me to see pitchers being so slow today. It slows down the game, and it bores the fans.
767508264955285500,Sun Aug 21 23:46:44 +0000 2016,When you work fast as a pitcher, you don't give the hitters enough time to situate the location of your pitches
767137066023002100,Sat Aug 20 23:11:43 +0000 2016,Jose Altuve is unique. There's only one Altuve. I haven't seen a 5 tool-player so small using all he has in such a powerful way.
767134856396562400,Sat Aug 20 23:02:57 +0000 2016,If Pomeranz maintains a good tempo he has a good chance to have success tonight.
767134782757212200,Sat Aug 20 23:02:39 +0000 2016,Pitching is all about location and being able to stay away from the strike zone when you need to.
767132014340366300,Sat Aug 20 22:51:39 +0000 2016,We might be entering into a pitching drought right now in the Majors, because teams are looking for power arms rather than mature arms.
767130373927166000,Sat Aug 20 22:45:08 +0000 2016,Young pitchers are focusing too much on developing the bigger muscles rather than the little ones.
767130156997681200,Sat Aug 20 22:44:16 +0000 2016,Although today's pitchers are better built physically, their little ligaments aren't.
767127420923174900,Sat Aug 20 22:33:24 +0000 2016,Young pitchers aren't being properly developed. You have to allow minor league pitchers to go through struggles and fight through them
767126657199120400,Sat Aug 20 22:30:22 +0000 2016,At this time of the year is all about momentum, and that finish by the Indians yesterday could boost their momentum.
767126379578220500,Sat Aug 20 22:29:16 +0000 2016,The Mets rotation has already pitched enough, so is not a bad idea to guard them a bit if they don't have a   chance for a playoff spot.

755256075159498800,Tue Jul 19 04:20:54 +0000 2016,Archer is not getting himself up on time. He needs to square himself better
755255535260303400,Tue Jul 19 04:18:46 +0000 2016,All the hitters have to do is track Archer's hands and see where his pitches are going. He is separating himself too much from his glove.
755250036230029300,Tue Jul 19 03:56:55 +0000 2016,Only certain guys have the aura, mentality and attitude to be a reliable closer.
755244255887626200,Tue Jul 19 03:33:57 +0000 2016,Chris Sale is a master at distracting the hitter's rhythm
755243208234397700,Tue Jul 19 03:29:47 +0000 2016,When it comes to shoulder issues, you gotta be really aware of having a setback. It's so uncomfortable to deal with it.
755243012431675400,Tue Jul 19 03:29:00 +0000 2016,Last time I saw Harvey I said he wasn't healthy; he wasn't finishing his pitches. Today it was devastating for me to see him go into surgery
755237720839057400,Tue Jul 19 03:07:58 +0000 2016,My emoji today is for Fernandez in FL 😎😎 14 Ks today!! Very exciting kid to watch tonight

749431809146970100,Sun Jul 03 02:37:21 +0000 2016,Gracias querida @nuriapiera por visitarnos y pasar un tiempo tan ameno en franca conversación. Te respetamos mucho! https://t.co/JQFBvTZg2d
744030819568721900,Sat Jun 18 04:55:45 +0000 2016,Jose Fernandez is a special pitcher and human being and in every form you look at him you see BOSTON RED SOX.
744030003013238800,Sat Jun 18 04:52:30 +0000 2016,I think the Orioles can use Gray to compete in that division against the Red Sox, Yankees, etc
744029656458862600,Sat Jun 18 04:51:08 +0000 2016,I would send Sonny Gray to Baltimore and get a big league ready type prospect
744014664862933000,Sat Jun 18 03:51:33 +0000 2016,If I was the Dodgers I would bring the farm players up and trade the big names; they need a change of scenery.
744009477653954600,Sat Jun 18 03:30:57 +0000 2016,It's scary to see young pitchers struggling to get to the 6th inning. It's hard for baseball
744007603764625400,Sat Jun 18 03:23:30 +0000 2016,I felt like to go out there and pitch only 5 innings was a disgrace for me. I worked so hard that to me 5 innings was not enough to win
744007366438355000,Sat Jun 18 03:22:33 +0000 2016,Sometimes it looks to me that Urias is forcing his pitches to get to where he wants to be, instead of letting his body go into motion
744007122522775600,Sat Jun 18 03:21:35 +0000 2016,Urias needs to save energy and just pitch the game without thinking about what the results might be
744006854888415200,Sat Jun 18 03:20:31 +0000 2016,Julio Urias seems to be big league ready but he needs to relax and understands he is learning how to win
744002045183615000,Sat Jun 18 03:01:25 +0000 2016,Having Sal Perez in your lineup it's like having a second manager on your team

742582843562287100,Tue Jun 14 05:02:01 +0000 2016,My final strike is for Max Scherzer. Tonight he brought some of my own games back to memory. Great job 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
742573734880378900,Tue Jun 14 04:25:49 +0000 2016,I have to give all the credit in the world to the SF coaching staff. This team is always on top of every single fundamental they have to do
742572224784146400,Tue Jun 14 04:19:49 +0000 2016,Ryan Braun would be a great fit with the SF Giants. I think he could adjust well and those big gaps in that stadium would be perfect for him
742571896605007900,Tue Jun 14 04:18:31 +0000 2016,SF Giants don't have big name players, but they have great players all over the place.
742566161276010500,Tue Jun 14 03:55:43 +0000 2016,I hope Shields realizes he's flying open and his head is too far away from his release point. He needs to work on his mechanics.
742565770765340700,Tue Jun 14 03:54:10 +0000 2016,I haven't seen the biggest gap between K-rod's fastball and his change up. I don't know what is going on, maybe he is having an off day.
742565534659530800,Tue Jun 14 03:53:14 +0000 2016,As a pitcher when you lean over and you go early, your arm is rushed, your head is pulled and your hands have no choice but to go with you
742563360625950700,Tue Jun 14 03:44:35 +0000 2016,As Detroit goes, K-Rod is going to be exposed.
742551940823842800,Tue Jun 14 02:59:13 +0000 2016,The Yankees have the money and the structure to make a move or two. If they get the help to get through the 6th inning, they are unbeatable
742551397170745300,Tue Jun 14 02:57:03 +0000 2016,I tell young pitchers follow the ball, the ball should lead you. If you see a guy looking bad on a breaking ball, why throw him a fastball?

740635145191850000,Wed Jun 08 20:02:33 +0000 2016,I don't defend Yordano's reactions but he might be having issues off the field that are affecting his actions on the field.
740634700461400000,Wed Jun 08 20:00:47 +0000 2016,Yordano doesn't know how to handle the situation he's in. People might want to have a say but no one is on his shoes. Sad, but true
740634161174564900,Wed Jun 08 19:58:38 +0000 2016,No defiendo las acciones de Yordano, pero seria bueno saber si sus problemas no son relacionados a su carrera. Quizás pasa algo personal
740633624693723100,Wed Jun 08 19:56:31 +0000 2016,Es fácil opinar desde afuera lo que puede ser algo muy de adentro y mucho mas que el béisbol o simplemente lanzar
740633341104259100,Wed Jun 08 19:55:23 +0000 2016,Yordano no sabe manejar la situación en la que está, y ahora todo el mundo quiere opinar sobre eso sin vivirlo. Es lamentable

735701101467439100,Thu May 26 05:16:25 +0000 2016,Cano looks like a guy that feels comfortable, confident and happy in Seattle. MVP! MVP!
735692783357284400,Thu May 26 04:43:22 +0000 2016,The Seattle team might not hear their names mentioned a lot, but they're making themselves sound loud and clear about shooting for the WS
735691398813339600,Thu May 26 04:37:52 +0000 2016,I think it's ok when managers have patience to discipline young players. With old ball players it's a different approach. They know better.
735691211156000800,Thu May 26 04:37:07 +0000 2016,Today Matz pitched a clinic on how to keep hitters looking like bobbleheads
735688878791626800,Thu May 26 04:27:51 +0000 2016,Matz looks like a 20 game winner at the end of the year. He changes eye level on the hitters and makes them feel uncomfortable.
735688708028960800,Thu May 26 04:27:11 +0000 2016,Matz is a leftie that can over power you. He seemed to be totally confident about mixing his pitches
735688451689840600,Thu May 26 04:26:09 +0000 2016,My advice to Harvey is to try to keep his cool and work through things. There is nothing wrong with saying "I didn't have it today"
735688012693016600,Thu May 26 04:24:25 +0000 2016,When you don't talk to the media you allow them to speculate
735684402705924100,Thu May 26 04:10:04 +0000 2016,I can totally understand how Harvey felt last night. Sometimes you don't feel like talking, but at the same time, it's part of the package
735683918293127200,Thu May 26 04:08:09 +0000 2016,NomarMazara is a kid that at such a young age is being able to handle himself the way he is doing
735675091422449700,Thu May 26 03:33:04 +0000 2016,Carter might end up with 37 or 38 home runs at the end of the year; he's slowly sneaking in the Brewers's line up
735671993681514500,Thu May 26 03:20:46 +0000 2016,I like Gregory Polanco's move to the middle of the line up; it'll help him mature a bit more about his strike zone knowledge
735671771865714700,Thu May 26 03:19:53 +0000 2016,Rickey Henderson is the best lead off hitter that came through the game
735671580022411300,Thu May 26 03:19:07 +0000 2016,The Yankees should fill up the gap of Teixeira right now; they need someone that is able to play first base with a powerful left bat
735659317035176000,Thu May 26 02:30:23 +0000 2016,Chili Davis and Jim Rice can get a little piece of credit on Bradley JR's hitting, but him as a hitter deserves most of it
734961682758438900,Tue May 24 04:18:14 +0000 2016,La diferencia entre lanzar y tirar es que cualquier puede tirar, pero no todo el mundo puede lanzar o pitchear...
734960443324829700,Tue May 24 04:13:19 +0000 2016,Tirar es soltar una pelota sin ningún propósito; lanzar es todo lo contrario
734959396447477800,Tue May 24 04:09:09 +0000 2016,El propósito y el conocimiento de un lanzador es lo que dicta cada lanzamiento, cada localización y cada velocidad que usa
734955963497775100,Tue May 24 03:55:31 +0000 2016,In pitching every pitch, every location and every speed is dictated by the pitcher's purpose and knowledge.
734955817905082400,Tue May 24 03:54:56 +0000 2016,Throwing is releasing a ball without a purpose; pitching is the total opposite.
734954807467880400,Tue May 24 03:50:55 +0000 2016,The difference between pitching and throwing is that anybody can throw, but not everybody can pitch.
734953622488928300,Tue May 24 03:46:13 +0000 2016,When you are a pitcher like Kershaw you don't throw a game, you pitch a game. He's not a thrower, he is a pitcher
734534186841833500,Sun May 22 23:59:31 +0000 2016,Hitters can make adjustments from at-bat to at-bat, but pitchers can't do that from one moment to another. They need to practice it.
734533951319085000,Sun May 22 23:58:35 +0000 2016,We train the pitchers in Spring Training to pitch below the strike zone or above the strike zone. You can't teach them to change that now
734533513349869600,Sun May 22 23:56:51 +0000 2016,Let's not mess around with changing the strike zone in the middle of the season. That should wait till next year.
734510851655389200,Sun May 22 22:26:48 +0000 2016,When Manny Ramirez didn't feel comfortable at the plate he would just track pitches. That helps hitters get back to the rhythm
734510640048541700,Sun May 22 22:25:57 +0000 2016,Stanton might have to get his eyes checked. After being hit with that fastball on the head, that might be a reason he's not seeing the ball
734510234891386900,Sun May 22 22:24:21 +0000 2016,Scherzer has command of everything he possesses and is doing an outstanding job with it too.

718666827304419300,Sat Apr 09 05:08:18 +0000 2016,Trevor Story has created a beautiful STORY by taking the entire week to himself
718666299497390100,Sat Apr 09 05:06:12 +0000 2016,I believe Walker is a little too short and is not creating deception with his mechanics. He's not staying long enough on the rubber
718661488274194400,Sat Apr 09 04:47:05 +0000 2016,I better relax!! 🌺 https://t.co/N7ankzrhFi
718660033257594900,Sat Apr 09 04:41:18 +0000 2016,I would love to see an umpire trying to pin point the black at 97 mph. I would be behind home plate calling the shots, to see how it feels
718657256087294000,Sat Apr 09 04:30:16 +0000 2016,The Dodgers probably agreed on the decision of taking Stripling out on the 100 pitch count, prior to the game
718656616619499500,Sat Apr 09 04:27:44 +0000 2016,I'm glad I didn't come up on this era. Rookie or not I would have fought to stay in on a no-hitter
718655597038710800,Sat Apr 09 04:23:40 +0000 2016,I think God is baptizing Ross Stripling on his major league debut with this rain over the stadium
718647499444105200,Sat Apr 09 03:51:30 +0000 2016,I think Conforto will be in the third spot for the Mets by the end of the season
718644292269523000,Sat Apr 09 03:38:45 +0000 2016,Four days into the season I'm sure MLB's committee is already sitting down about the slide rule. This is too much and is costing games
718295950368862200,Fri Apr 08 04:34:34 +0000 2016,Stroman has a big heart for baseball, and that is something that you're not taught. You're either born with it or you're not.
718295845318324200,Fri Apr 08 04:34:09 +0000 2016,Stroman location is way above his age, and that is a sign of maturity.
718295749671460900,Fri Apr 08 04:33:46 +0000 2016,It's delightful to see Stroman and his development as a young pitcher. He uses his temple to his advantage and speeds up the game
718293849647530000,Fri Apr 08 04:26:13 +0000 2016,I would love to see Soler go to a place like Milwaukee, just so that he can get playing time, and be left alone
718293690758860800,Fri Apr 08 04:25:35 +0000 2016,Paul Goldschmidt reminds me of Jeff Bagwell. Similar approaches, reliable and trust worthy.
718283129996386300,Fri Apr 08 03:43:37 +0000 2016,I think the new 30 seconds visit to the mound is for the good of the game.
718279219114090500,Fri Apr 08 03:28:05 +0000 2016,I think Jean Segurà needed a change of scenery, just like Starlin Castro to perform better
718278677780369400,Fri Apr 08 03:25:56 +0000 2016,Trevor Story has become the Cinderella story for the Rockies. He has taken advantage of an emergency situation and has performed
718271855220629500,Fri Apr 08 02:58:49 +0000 2016,We're about to enter a new generation of short stops:1.Carlos Correa 2. Corey Seager 3.Trevor Story 4. Xander Bogaerts 5. Francisco Lindor
718271415930208300,Fri Apr 08 02:57:05 +0000 2016,The main purpose of a veteran pitcher is to get hitters out. Period.
718265313461186600,Fri Apr 08 02:32:50 +0000 2016,I think Ruby thinks too much and he overuses his pitches. He doesn't know how great of a stuff he has, so he still doesn't trust it
718261864623423500,Fri Apr 08 02:19:07 +0000 2016,Ruby De La Rosa has been around now for quite a while. I think this is the year to take advantage, he's healthy and should come into his own
718261381586427900,Fri Apr 08 02:17:12 +0000 2016,Ubaldo is finally settling down with his mechanics. He's mixing his pitches, fastball and breaking ball, and maturing in his location.
718261227554795500,Fri Apr 08 02:16:35 +0000 2016,Ubaldo is ahead of schedule. He looked great today and had great poise
717894827631845400,Thu Apr 07 02:00:39 +0000 2016,Maeda is going to be more of a finesse pitcher, not so much of an overpowering one
717890775837777900,Thu Apr 07 01:44:33 +0000 2016,I think the X factor for the Dodgers is Carl Crawford. He needs to be on the field and needs to produce
717887447523323900,Thu Apr 07 01:31:19 +0000 2016,Correa is an A-Rod type shortstop, but in a better version
717887218430447600,Thu Apr 07 01:30:25 +0000 2016,It has been heartbreaking to see the Pirates as they have gotten so close to win it. But things will fall at the right time; it will happen.
717881772328030200,Thu Apr 07 01:08:46 +0000 2016,Hanley Ramirez worked extremely hard this off season to come back looking the way he is. His shoulder is healthy and he is in great shape
717881316054851600,Thu Apr 07 01:06:57 +0000 2016,In cold weather pitchers will throw a lot of flat change ups and not so good sliders. It takes time to adjust from hot to cold temperatures
717582157317873700,Wed Apr 06 05:18:12 +0000 2016,Aaron Sanchez has a tail to his fastball that is unique; the gap between it and his breaking ball and the spin it creates is special
717581072268181500,Wed Apr 06 05:13:54 +0000 2016,Aaron Sanchez has no ceiling. He has all the tools to become a number one starter. He is a special kid
717579973863800800,Wed Apr 06 05:09:32 +0000 2016,Staying away from the cutter is not a bad thing https://t.co/MqbAaHezxK
717578188814213100,Wed Apr 06 05:02:26 +0000 2016,A cutter can make you change your arm angle, and therefore make you lose some velocity https://t.co/NmV0sGasev
717576297770270700,Wed Apr 06 04:54:55 +0000 2016,I don't think Syndergaard needs a cutter. He has a good enough slider and the slider can be really damaging to the elbow
717575587154567200,Wed Apr 06 04:52:06 +0000 2016,When Syndergaard learns how to separate the slider from the change up he will be unhittable. He needs to build a bigger gap between them.
717574636561702900,Wed Apr 06 04:48:19 +0000 2016,I believe Syndergaard has a mighty fastball, a mighty slider and a powerful breaking ball.
717574226337783800,Wed Apr 06 04:46:42 +0000 2016,Pedro Strop is getting really big and that is not good. I don't like to see that much muscle in young pictures, they can lose flexibility
717574011916521500,Wed Apr 06 04:45:50 +0000 2016,I am extremely proud of David and I hope he finishes his career with the same love and smile that he brought initially to the Red Sox
717572209070444500,Wed Apr 06 04:38:41 +0000 2016,I am so happy to see David doing what he has been training to do. Win.
717572012244340700,Wed Apr 06 04:37:54 +0000 2016,Price looked really good, just like he in Spring Training. He told me he felt relaxed because he will spend all this time in one city
717569832300974100,Wed Apr 06 04:29:14 +0000 2016,Harold still has it! Flipping it! https://t.co/30htccGYpT
717567228955197400,Wed Apr 06 04:18:53 +0000 2016,If the Dodgers want to have any success they need Puig to step up
717567026965966800,Wed Apr 06 04:18:05 +0000 2016,In critical situations when a game is on the line the umpires will have to be more careful about their judgement https://t.co/i9sEqXTpcj

717233846190669800,Tue Apr 05 06:14:09 +0000 2016,No todos los jugadores muestran intensidad en el terreno, y no tienen que hacerlo para demostrar que son profesionales en su rendimiento
717233252449255400,Tue Apr 05 06:11:47 +0000 2016,Estoy seguro que algún día Clayton se unirá a mí en Cooperstown
717212604830249000,Tue Apr 05 04:49:44 +0000 2016,Greinke didn't use enough breaking balls tonight. Most of the pitches the Rockies hit were straight fast balls
717212104739201000,Tue Apr 05 04:47:45 +0000 2016,As a pitcher if something is not working for you in a game, you have to quickly switch it and make the adjustment
717209805094568000,Tue Apr 05 04:38:37 +0000 2016,Colorado knows something that nobody is talking about. They felt too comfortable against Greinke tonight
717208382491463700,Tue Apr 05 04:32:58 +0000 2016,For sure one day Clayton will join me in Cooperstown
717208266711965700,Tue Apr 05 04:32:30 +0000 2016,My Pitching Ranking 5. Dallas Keuchel 4. Davis Price  3. Zack Greinke 2. Jake Arrieta 1.Clayton Kershaw
717205419861614600,Tue Apr 05 04:21:11 +0000 2016,I think someone else's head should've been on the hot seat besides Robin Ventura
717204857871052800,Tue Apr 05 04:18:57 +0000 2016,I would've love to see a guy like Pedro Alvarez in the White Sox. They need a powerful left handed type of bat
717203293127241700,Tue Apr 05 04:12:44 +0000 2016,There is a really good fan base in Colorado so they need someone to consistently represent the team
717202871792582700,Tue Apr 05 04:11:04 +0000 2016,Not all players show you intensity on the field, and they don't have to in order for them to be professional and perform
717202541520490500,Tue Apr 05 04:09:45 +0000 2016,Beltre and King Felix are just two competitors going at it, in a good respectful way
717199745953972200,Tue Apr 05 03:58:39 +0000 2016,We all know some umpires have made some costly calls to players and teams
717199458069557200,Tue Apr 05 03:57:30 +0000 2016,When an umpire doesn't give you a call on a pitch, your concentration goes away
717100042084094000,Mon Apr 04 21:22:27 +0000 2016,Yeahhhh ready for it!!!  https://t.co/YEsoBC3vxH

661058540833022000,Mon Nov 02 05:53:32 +0000 2015,"Regular" people that have to deal with situations too, are not under the scrutiny of 60,000 loud fans, the media, an organization, etc
661056177325924400,Mon Nov 02 05:44:09 +0000 2015,Personal and family situations to assume our job effectively and seriously

657051725258444800,Thu Oct 22 04:31:53 +0000 2015,The Cubs came in this year with one ace. Out of the sudden they got two, and two good ones. So they have a bright future as a team
657051505296568300,Thu Oct 22 04:31:00 +0000 2015,Awesome year for Familia! He did an unbelievable job to help the Mets reach this point
657050192814977000,Thu Oct 22 04:25:48 +0000 2015,I got emotional when Collins spoke about his parents, because I know what my family means to me. He deserves to enjoy this moment
657049900128014300,Thu Oct 22 04:24:38 +0000 2015,Congratulations to Terry Collins. For him to have the wedding anniversary of his parents the same day he's going to the WS it's awesome
657048978006110200,Thu Oct 22 04:20:58 +0000 2015,The Mets are my favorite to win the WS. They faced the best starting pitchers, and beat them, and I don't think they will face better arms.
657048499993858000,Thu Oct 22 04:19:04 +0000 2015,I was one that said that it would take the Cubs 2 years to reach the point where they are today, and they proved me wrong.
657048306028269600,Thu Oct 22 04:18:18 +0000 2015,This Cubs team has no ceiling and I want to congratulate them as a team and as an organization
656985375299235800,Thu Oct 22 00:08:14 +0000 2015,Matz debe controlar los bateadores zurdos. Su cambio debe ser su arma letal cuando esté arriba en el conteo.
656984271236812800,Thu Oct 22 00:03:51 +0000 2015,No tiene sentido forzar a Lester a que esté listo para lanzar hoy. Pero si el equipo gana, entonces que se aliste para mañana
656983854864072700,Thu Oct 22 00:02:11 +0000 2015,Lo único que puede romper el ritmo que llevan los Mets, es que la lluvia ayude a los Cubs y se posponga el partido
656983496322359300,Thu Oct 22 00:00:46 +0000 2015,Just so that people don't think about curses and stuff, I go Cubs!
656983393327054800,Thu Oct 22 00:00:21 +0000 2015,If the Cubs win today, tomorrow could be a more logical idea for Lester to pitch
656982964719493100,Wed Oct 21 23:58:39 +0000 2015,If Lester won't make a difference in tonight's game, I don't see why he should be up to pitch. But as a leader your cleats have to be ready
656981940881477600,Wed Oct 21 23:54:35 +0000 2015,I like this match up because they are both young arms.
656981811944366100,Wed Oct 21 23:54:04 +0000 2015,La Potencia from Miami! For a big guy like Cespedes, his speed it's excellent to run the bases
656980210227781600,Wed Oct 21 23:47:42 +0000 2015,Granderson has been very very grande for the Mets. He has run the bases, has hit the ball, so if it's not broken, don't fix it.
656979929356247000,Wed Oct 21 23:46:35 +0000 2015,Matz can't allow the lefties to hurt him. He has to control them
656979860208930800,Wed Oct 21 23:46:19 +0000 2015,Matz could feed up off what the other pitchers have done. He's gonna have to spot his breaking ball when he is ahead in the count.
656978864883806200,Wed Oct 21 23:42:22 +0000 2015,A rain-out could be the best thing that can happen to the Cubs. It will give the team some breather to make adjustments
656978559379112000,Wed Oct 21 23:41:09 +0000 2015,If the Cubbies could get a rain-out tonight, that could probably disrupt the rhythm the Mets have right now
656978304520626200,Wed Oct 21 23:40:08 +0000 2015,The Cubs have to try to keep the Mets to a minimum, without forcing anything too much

655952757812146200,Mon Oct 19 03:44:59 +0000 2015,Thorrrrr kept the ball low and well located. Didn't have to bother manipulating the sinker. He ran the ball quickly and effectively.

655589758903517200,Sun Oct 18 03:42:33 +0000 2015,The Royals don't try to overdo things, they just do little things that are effective
655589433970823200,Sun Oct 18 03:41:15 +0000 2015,Like Kershaw Price has another opportunity to redeem himself. Tonight it wasn't his fault, the Royals take advantage of every mistake made
655588929899335700,Sun Oct 18 03:39:15 +0000 2015,Davis it's a steady closer. Him and Familia are the go to guys to close it up for the team
655588717889884200,Sun Oct 18 03:38:25 +0000 2015,The Royals are resilient and they can get to you in so many different ways
655585775468212200,Sun Oct 18 03:26:43 +0000 2015,On Harvey I saw a guy that was out there to stay and to win, he showed that he can do it and proved a lot of people wrong
655585075761811500,Sun Oct 18 03:23:56 +0000 2015,You don't run on la Potencia, Cespedes!
655584030683869200,Sun Oct 18 03:19:47 +0000 2015,Harvey had an outstanding command and great break on his pitches; they were falling on the spot he wanted and the speed he wanted
654892173649944600,Fri Oct 16 05:30:36 +0000 2015,Happy "toilet" bday! To our awesome colleague @CaseyStern @garysheffield @TurnerSportsPR http://t.co/A1URSpU3Xk

654872731557720000,Fri Oct 16 04:13:20 +0000 2015,Mets pitching could definitely hold the Cubs, but if Arrieta and Lester bring up their pedigree they could hold on the Mets offensive.

654866812463665200,Fri Oct 16 03:49:49 +0000 2015,Degrom holds the balls for quite a while but then accelerates faster. He is much more difficult to hit from the stretch than the wind up
654866679411953700,Fri Oct 16 03:49:17 +0000 2015,Degrom was flying open, location wasn't there, but he battled his way up

654839034573926400,Fri Oct 16 01:59:26 +0000 2015,Degrom really showed me something tonight. When he didn't have his best stuff, he battled his way through

654142843737493500,Wed Oct 14 03:53:01 +0000 2015,When you see talent you have to appreciate it. Stroman is a special kid, the Jays just have to watch out for his left knee and his future
654142032424902700,Wed Oct 14 03:49:48 +0000 2015,You have to give credit to the entire St Louis organization for the way the handle their system. Everything it’s straight from top to bottom
654140157579407400,Wed Oct 14 03:42:21 +0000 2015,I was impressed with Grimm as he showed he was carrying a bit heart out there
654139607039246300,Wed Oct 14 03:40:10 +0000 2015,When a pitcher gives up a hit to a pitcher it feels weird its a guilty feeling, specially in key situations. Lackey's pitch lacked location
654136933065560000,Wed Oct 14 03:29:32 +0000 2015,For Kershaw this is a straight start of an HOF career. He took a huge load of his shoulder. For him this victory feels like a Cy Young award
654136593507315700,Wed Oct 14 03:28:11 +0000 2015,Kershaw showed his aggressiveness before the game then turn around and regroup and settled down. He was attacking the Mets with his tempo
654135349027958800,Wed Oct 14 03:23:15 +0000 2015,Kershaw realized what he was doing wrong last time, he was forcing the issue with fastball and got paid for it. Today he mixed his pitches
654134974145265700,Wed Oct 14 03:21:45 +0000 2015,Jansen was getting better as he was making pitches, it took him a bit, but he had a much better feel for his pitches in his second inning
654134751381557200,Wed Oct 14 03:20:52 +0000 2015,Kershaw came out ready to battle. He took it personal and he wanted to take it upon him to get that energy to the team
654043966413905900,Tue Oct 13 21:20:07 +0000 2015,Told you Baez was going to upgrade his game!
654031280531734500,Tue Oct 13 20:29:43 +0000 2015,I can't expect Lackey to be better than he was in his first outing, so I think this will be a battle of the bullpens ...I go with Chicago
654030511149596700,Tue Oct 13 20:26:39 +0000 2015,I think it's important to win and to win now. I wouldn't like to see the Cubs go back to St. Louis
654030376155918300,Tue Oct 13 20:26:07 +0000 2015,I don't think Baez it's a bad defensive player. He was in his first playoffs game, so I think tonight he will be different, better
654029946797576200,Tue Oct 13 20:24:25 +0000 2015,Fowler it's igniting the whole line up and the team. He has been swinging the bat well
654029272663916500,Tue Oct 13 20:21:44 +0000 2015,The ligament Molina it's dealing with its irreplaceable. So if I was St Louis I would try to stay away from playing Molina in.
654029118300901400,Tue Oct 13 20:21:07 +0000 2015,Molina it's also helpful in other ways . If he is in the bench he might calling out other things during the game
654028148510715900,Tue Oct 13 20:17:16 +0000 2015,When talking about Molina's absence it's never minimal. He is the absolute best at handling the pitchers blocks the plate and it's reliable
654026549130301400,Tue Oct 13 20:10:55 +0000 2015,Hammel raises some question marks; didn't pitch well towards the end of the season and he'll be pitching after 11 days without action
654026085890437100,Tue Oct 13 20:09:04 +0000 2015,Wrigley has no foul ground and with the wind blowing out you might be in for a long day
653806400322318300,Tue Oct 13 05:36:07 +0000 2015,Harvey se veía tímido en su lenguaje corporal. No se le veía esa adrenalina con la que generalmente sale y nos tiene acostumbrados
653806041038237700,Tue Oct 13 05:34:41 +0000 2015,Arrieta no se veía cómodo. No tenía dominio de sus lanzamientos ni de las rectas. Lo vi un poco fatigado
653805757260017700,Tue Oct 13 05:33:34 +0000 2015,Wacha estaba errático en los lanzamientos. Y contra un equipo como Chicago, eso trae problemas y muchos palos
653805374148112400,Tue Oct 13 05:32:02 +0000 2015,En la noche de hoy, Carlos Correa es mi papa! Impresionante la madurez de este joven boricua y su presencia en la alineación
653803902509432800,Tue Oct 13 05:26:12 +0000 2015,I love la Potencia, but Carlos Correa it's my daddy! He is probably the youngest daddy in the history of TBS postseason
653801871019241500,Tue Oct 13 05:18:07 +0000 2015,Correa it's impressive. He is so mature for his age. The way he handles himself brings an aura, presence to the whole team
653801667318710300,Tue Oct 13 05:17:19 +0000 2015,Soler took every at bat like he was the veteran of the team. He took his bat, was tracking the pitches and doing damage with it
653800582369681400,Tue Oct 13 05:13:00 +0000 2015,That's called ambush. Soler ambushed the first pitch and hit a ding dong Jhonson
653799560800804900,Tue Oct 13 05:08:56 +0000 2015,Wacha was missing location and when you miss location against a team like Chicago you'll get pay back
653799384501628900,Tue Oct 13 05:08:14 +0000 2015,Arrieta didn't seem comfortable. He wasn't throwing strikes or commanding the fastballs . I saw him a little bit fatigued.

653797180604592100,Tue Oct 13 04:59:29 +0000 2015,Familia took out the Dodgers with 11 pitches. That is outstanding and I'm extremely proud. He kept a great attitude
653794604345618400,Tue Oct 13 04:49:15 +0000 2015,Scared me a bit when I saw Familia because you don't want to expose him to the opposition, specially if you can save him for one more day
653794381946859500,Tue Oct 13 04:48:22 +0000 2015,Cespedes hit a longgggg ding dong dong Jhonson !!!!
653794241773236200,Tue Oct 13 04:47:48 +0000 2015,Harvey looked a bit tentative even before the game. I didn't see that look of the dark night we are accustomed to see in him

653689152119115800,Mon Oct 12 21:50:13 +0000 2015,For a game like this, as a pitcher I don't want the opposition to feel comfortable. I don't want them to know what I'm doing at all
653688529361485800,Mon Oct 12 21:47:45 +0000 2015,Utley had a clear look how to get Tejada down without hurting him.  He can play hard, not dirty
653688391071084500,Mon Oct 12 21:47:12 +0000 2015,I think Torre had to cover his back and MLB 's back. But this has no precedent, for a player to be suspended in the playoffs
653081307413639200,Sun Oct 11 05:34:52 +0000 2015,My daddy for today it's Jorge Soler, a good looking young man, strong like a mule and he plays for the Cubbies
653076234646196200,Sun Oct 11 05:14:42 +0000 2015,Colon is a starter and a veteran. I think he could have faced the situation and not be taken out.
653075478111256600,Sun Oct 11 05:11:42 +0000 2015,Lack of anticipation caused Cardinals's GARCIA to never think about the runner he had on third base
653075271592054800,Sun Oct 11 05:10:52 +0000 2015,In the middle of the noise a pitcher needs to be prepared, anticipate and react to any situation.
653074964690681900,Sun Oct 11 05:09:39 +0000 2015,Joe Torre and MLB office should be dropping some names of the guys reviewing plays back in NY. Replays are good, if the call it's right
653073387686887400,Sun Oct 11 05:03:23 +0000 2015,If you tell Utley to teach kids to slide on second base? Would he teach them the way he slided tonight?
653072037381042200,Sun Oct 11 04:58:01 +0000 2015,It bothered me to see Utley's slide and the way he went after Tejada. Being a 2nd base man he needed to think how to break the DP not hisleg
653015982944989200,Sun Oct 11 01:15:17 +0000 2015,Greinke ha estado estudiando lo que hace Kershaw para hacerlo mejor.Ambos se estudian y aprenden el uno del otro. Greinke es muy profesional

653014183244660700,Sun Oct 11 01:08:08 +0000 2015,No me gusta mucho como se ven las alineaciones hoy, así que esta noche me voy con los METS
653013789110075400,Sun Oct 11 01:06:34 +0000 2015,I'm not very happy with the way lineups are structured tonight.  I am going to go with the METS
653013574168760300,Sun Oct 11 01:05:43 +0000 2015,Syndergaard's has to continue to be the aggressor like Degrom. If he can get the feel for his pitches, he could have them under his sleeve
653012748171911200,Sun Oct 11 01:02:26 +0000 2015,Syndergaard's needs to copy what Degrom did as he attacked the strike zone and became better through the game, establishing his fastball
653011357818863600,Sun Oct 11 00:56:54 +0000 2015,Greinke has a high iQ. He is a professional pitcher and studies the game
653011256299941900,Sun Oct 11 00:56:30 +0000 2015,Greinke feeds off everything Kershaw's been doing, to do it a little better. They study each other and learn from each other.
653009361829294100,Sun Oct 11 00:48:58 +0000 2015,Just like Degrom, I like Syndergaard's poise. He'll be a monster when he understands how resourceful he is as a pitcher

651907866496864300,Wed Oct 07 23:52:01 +0000 2015,Cole needs to go out there focused and just like what he is, a cold blooded killer.
651907456168099800,Wed Oct 07 23:50:24 +0000 2015,I love the confidence shown by Arrieta, but I don't like it when used with the opposition because you can wake up a sleeping giant.
651905274169585700,Wed Oct 07 23:41:43 +0000 2015,As for Arrieta as soon as I get Pedro Alvarez out,I´m thinking who am I getting a double play from? Double play is a pitcher's best friend

648191059239931900,Sun Sep 27 17:42:45 +0000 2015,The Jays are sturdy with talent from top to bottom, a 20 year old closer, David Price, and all hitters adding their piece to the puzzle

646906255135625200,Thu Sep 24 04:37:24 +0000 2015,With all due respect to Matt Harvey I applaud Terry Collins attitude, as he's showing who's running the team and taking pressure off Harvey
646903488614678500,Thu Sep 24 04:26:25 +0000 2015,One big sign of the Pirates's maturity  it's the way they finished tonight's game. They were quite because they know it's not done yet

646886712883478500,Thu Sep 24 03:19:45 +0000 2015,In baseball the better you do, the more they expect of you, next year, and next year, and next year.

646885330038222800,Thu Sep 24 03:14:15 +0000 2015,Jake Arrieta it's #awardworthy because he's coming into his own. Arrieta has taken the Cubs on his back, helping Lester in pitching rotation

642542493758718000,Sat Sep 12 03:37:23 +0000 2015,I think Rodney is doing something different with his change up. He is doing something wrong mechanically.
642540260438642700,Sat Sep 12 03:28:30 +0000 2015,Cashner has great stuff but a bit of a losing attitude, and when that happens it works against everything you're trying to do.
642539846976733200,Sat Sep 12 03:26:51 +0000 2015,I have to include Houston as a cinderella story type. They are right there, right now.
642538060333224000,Sat Sep 12 03:19:46 +0000 2015,Having Paul Molitor as the presence of the Twins its the biggest key. Torri Hunter keeps the clubhouse working and that's a good combination

642537176962437100,Sat Sep 12 03:16:15 +0000 2015,You have to pace the KC relievers a bit more because they're coming with a hangover from pitching a lot. If they rest them, KC will be ok.
642185908159037400,Fri Sep 11 04:00:26 +0000 2015,In the NL, my two favorite teams are the Cubs and the Mets: the Cubs look the way they should be looking.

642179925022117900,Fri Sep 11 03:36:39 +0000 2015,In my heart Nolan Arenado should be the NL MVP, he is hitting everywhere, not only at home, but on the road, and playing great defense
642179565926744000,Fri Sep 11 03:35:14 +0000 2015,In Boston you have to live up to what you say, the Media its on you everyday, and a GM needs know how to deal with that pressure
642179156634038300,Fri Sep 11 03:33:36 +0000 2015,When it comes to being a GM in Boston you will be in the line of fire everyday because of the eastern division. Boston it's very demanding
642178537143730200,Fri Sep 11 03:31:09 +0000 2015,As a GM for the Mariners I would look for a manager with presence, someone that will be a leader and a veteran catcher, like Carlos Ruiz
642177909579321300,Fri Sep 11 03:28:39 +0000 2015,As a GM now I would pick the Mariners. They have the nucleus in starting rotation, offense in Cano and Cruz, a and a steady shortstop

642177075063840800,Fri Sep 11 03:25:20 +0000 2015,As a GM you owe it to the fan base that goes out there to see a player worth seeing. You can't dismantle a team and leave fans with nothing

642174947234713600,Fri Sep 11 03:16:53 +0000 2015,As a pitcher in the big leagues, you have to go get it yourself. You have to be relentless and competitive.
642174687825432600,Fri Sep 11 03:15:51 +0000 2015,As a pitcher sometimes you have to go get it from someone that is not as hungry as you.In the big leagues nobody will give you anything free

642171487995035600,Fri Sep 11 03:03:08 +0000 2015,When as a young pitcher you don't struggle and the time to struggle comes, its hard to deal with it, but you have to grind your way through
642171030794997800,Fri Sep 11 03:01:19 +0000 2015,You have to be mentally strong enough when you don't get run support. Your duty is to get the opposition, not to worry about your team
642170276197732400,Fri Sep 11 02:58:19 +0000 2015,As a pitcher, don't get distracted based on numbers, All star game etc., just focus on the outing and take games one by one
642168348109762600,Fri Sep 11 02:50:39 +0000 2015,As a pitcher, don't go too hard after the first half because you can lose the stamina you gained.
642166749350129700,Fri Sep 11 02:44:18 +0000 2015,Once you get to Spring Training, you have to be able to throw on the side. As the season goes you fine tune your pitches and build innings

641819704147898400,Thu Sep 10 03:45:16 +0000 2015,There is a key to playing fundamentals with a flare: it's called anticipation.
641815373617061900,Thu Sep 10 03:28:04 +0000 2015,The KC Royals play the game so right, and they take advantage of the little mistakes the other team makes.
641815019156406300,Thu Sep 10 03:26:39 +0000 2015,I liked the KC Royals the entire year because they can beat you in every way possible in baseball, speed, fundamentals, power.

641349673874133000,Tue Sep 08 20:37:32 +0000 2015,The Mets have to monitor how many stressful innings Harvey has been having and keep him to under 5 innings no matter what the situation is

641326588278231000,Tue Sep 08 19:05:48 +0000 2015,Before our new generation of players it was Andujar, Mario Melvin Soto, Pedro Borbon and we all grew up idolizing these guys

637397997144313900,Fri Aug 28 22:54:59 +0000 2015,For a pitcher to make small mechanical adjustments he needs a lot of repetition, because your body it's like a chain reaction
637396194612789200,Fri Aug 28 22:47:49 +0000 2015,The tip for C. Martinez will keep him healthier for a longer time, helps his head stay on the target a bit more and tracks the ball longer

637124874213822500,Fri Aug 28 04:49:41 +0000 2015,You have to wonder what went wrong? To me, having such talent in a team and not making it, there's must be something wrong about chemistry.
637123958186184700,Fri Aug 28 04:46:03 +0000 2015,It's disappointing to see talents like Cano, Verlander, Cabrera and know their teams are out of contention with such awesome players

636744988064284700,Thu Aug 27 03:40:09 +0000 2015,The Astros pitchers are pitching like they have been in the big leagues for 3 to 4 years.
636742576490414100,Thu Aug 27 03:30:34 +0000 2015,Once you bring Latino players you bring the whole package and the way we are to America. You can't separate the person from the player
636742204153720800,Thu Aug 27 03:29:06 +0000 2015,As a pitcher my purpose was to make a hitter lose his mind. I don't care how he reacted as long as I got him out.
636741502228525000,Thu Aug 27 03:26:18 +0000 2015,It wouldn't bother me to see Carlos Gomez react like that, because as a pitcher that's exactly what I am try to do, frustrate you

621181413283381200,Wed Jul 15 04:56:04 +0000 2015,I love the story of the Houston Astros in the first half, coming out of nowhere. A great Cinderella story
621179471278706700,Wed Jul 15 04:48:21 +0000 2015,In 99' All Star Game, I felt I was on top of the game and had total command of my pitches.
621179192726548500,Wed Jul 15 04:47:15 +0000 2015,Greinke was painting the corners like Picasso. It was an art to see him pitch tonight
621178955219898400,Wed Jul 15 04:46:18 +0000 2015,I think Trout knew that Greinke was going to attack the strike zone so he got ready to ambush the plate .

621093504345768000,Tue Jul 14 23:06:45 +0000 2015,So happy to see Manny Machado up and healthy! This kid has great MVP potential!!
619733414371962900,Sat Jul 11 05:02:14 +0000 2015,Mike Trout will let you where he is dangerous as he waggle his bat before a pitch.
619730929414639600,Sat Jul 11 04:52:22 +0000 2015,Gerrit Cole
619728767817093100,Sat Jul 11 04:43:46 +0000 2015,Cole is a cold blooded killer!! I believe he looks more mature than any other pitcher out there. He's having a Cy Young type season
619364743346716700,Fri Jul 10 04:37:16 +0000 2015,As locked in as Zack Greinke it's looking, he would be the right choice to start the ASG
619362101019029500,Fri Jul 10 04:26:46 +0000 2015,The eyes of a pitcher should be exactly where he wants to hit the spot http://t.co/o2Uq5nyGQ3
619361715872927700,Fri Jul 10 04:25:14 +0000 2015,I love to see that AJ Burnett is going to the All Star Game, even tough he is an old goat.
619361505369198600,Fri Jul 10 04:24:24 +0000 2015,When you are really talented you can take for granted the help other people want to give you.
619359256047849500,Fri Jul 10 04:15:28 +0000 2015,On a rainy day, pitchers have to move it, move it http://t.co/IjgBHwTIPC
619358844288827400,Fri Jul 10 04:13:50 +0000 2015,Zack Greinke looked really locked in tonight.
619356776798945300,Fri Jul 10 04:05:37 +0000 2015,On a rainy day a pitcher can get stiffed it he sits down for long time, or If he reaches for gas too early or if he doesn't warm up properly
619353287083438100,Fri Jul 10 03:51:45 +0000 2015,Seen Samardzija pick up his team its a great thing
619353014042624000,Fri Jul 10 03:50:40 +0000 2015,Its difficult for a pitcher to do what hitter does. A hitter can switch his approach in one at bat but a pitcher cant switch his mechanics
619351221766262800,Fri Jul 10 03:43:32 +0000 2015,Its important that General managers and organizations understand the crossover of Latinos to the US culture and how difficult that can be.
619346516742803500,Fri Jul 10 03:24:51 +0000 2015,Puig can be misunderstood a lot because of the flare he brings to the game and how he carries himself. But he is a good kid.
619346147467878400,Fri Jul 10 03:23:23 +0000 2015,Puig will settle and he is going to mature as a person and player. All that attention came back to bite him a bit, but he'll be fine.
619343338966114300,Fri Jul 10 03:12:13 +0000 2015,I pray Fernandez now knows how much it takes to stay healthy and tip top shape. I love him because he's friendly, outspoken, loves cameras,
619342927676903400,Fri Jul 10 03:10:35 +0000 2015,Jose Fernandez looks to me the same way he was before surgery; same arm angle, same velocity and same way to attack the home plate
618981134018326500,Thu Jul 09 03:12:57 +0000 2015,My compadre @davidortiz can and will continue to hit!!!
618980073907990500,Thu Jul 09 03:08:44 +0000 2015,Jacob Degrom looks mature and poised like a true ace should look, more than how Matt Harvey's looking right now
618979330417274900,Thu Jul 09 03:05:47 +0000 2015,I think Strop has the potential to become a great closer because of his speed, but has to work on his location.
618974536432664600,Thu Jul 09 02:46:44 +0000 2015,Everything Bogaerts has done for the Sox this year...I'm going to be counting the votes of Sox fans for Bogaerts...come on Sox nation VOTE
618974047779459100,Thu Jul 09 02:44:47 +0000 2015,Since I saw Bogaerts on double I think he's the most improved shortstop I have seen. He's being consistent as anybody in baseball.
614079771106918400,Thu Jun 25 14:36:41 +0000 2015,De dos de los países más pobres del Caribe, como la Embajada de EU lo está haciendo, en lugar de criticar desde fuera. Solo una sugerencia..

614078277926301700,Thu Jun 25 14:30:45 +0000 2015,Of two of the poorest countries in the Caribbean, like the US Embassy it's doing, instead of criticizing from outside. Just a suggestion...
614077881329692700,Thu Jun 25 14:29:10 +0000 2015,Since NY Mayor Bill de Blasio is so "worried" about the situation between DR and Haiti, why doesn't he come to do mediate the relationship

609581876232233000,Sat Jun 13 04:43:39 +0000 2015,I think Cano it's just going to the plate without a plan. Other than that, he's able to make adjustments http://t.co/9lD5Conc7B
609580210225291300,Sat Jun 13 04:37:02 +0000 2015,I am worried about Kershaw and the amount of walks he had today. That's not a good sign.
609578234624221200,Sat Jun 13 04:29:11 +0000 2015,Jaime Garcia is settling back to where he was before he got hurt. He is getting the feel for pitching again. He did great tonight
609578001743892500,Sat Jun 13 04:28:15 +0000 2015,Umpires are humans ,they go home and if they recognize they have blew up a game, they feel bad too.
609577502684643300,Sat Jun 13 04:26:16 +0000 2015,Umpires should go and review the call, if they feel doubtful, because at the end of the day both sides want to make sure they get it right.
609577394765197300,Sat Jun 13 04:25:50 +0000 2015,Rules are rules, but at the end, things just have to be done right
609574853298012200,Sat Jun 13 04:15:45 +0000 2015,As a pitcher you try to keep your team in the fight, and to give it the best chance to win, but you also want to go home with a W
609573778272710700,Sat Jun 13 04:11:28 +0000 2015,When working a no hitter, you continue to pitch your same game. You don't change anything.
609570935826456600,Sat Jun 13 04:00:11 +0000 2015,Cueto's mechanics...the Tiant move http://t.co/gvBMCjfVO0

609567003955826700,Sat Jun 13 03:44:33 +0000 2015,I made a living at Fenway Park pitching high in the inner part, taking advantage of hitters trying to hit that short wall on right field
609566626153934800,Sat Jun 13 03:43:03 +0000 2015,When you go in with a fastball you do it to make a statement. Have to be mature enough to understand you're making every pitch with purpose
609566412634464300,Sat Jun 13 03:42:12 +0000 2015,I have to tip my hat to Salazar for challenging such a good hitter as Miguel Cabrera
609565577343074300,Sat Jun 13 03:38:53 +0000 2015,Migui Cabrera is a big teddy bear, he has fun playing the game!! Mi niñññoooooo
609562687203315700,Sat Jun 13 03:27:24 +0000 2015,When things go wrong with the team, everything goes wrong. I dont think it's an exception that everything is going south with the Mariners
609562512988745700,Sat Jun 13 03:26:42 +0000 2015,We all go through what King Felix went through.The Astros came out swinging. Before you make adjustments, there're teams that jump on you
609562154585485300,Sat Jun 13 03:25:17 +0000 2015,Look at the old goat (Bartolo) tricking them!! El Chivo viejo haciendo de las suyas (Bartolo Colon)
609560687665356800,Sat Jun 13 03:19:27 +0000 2015,Whenever you don't play D, you gotta hit!!
609559847147839500,Sat Jun 13 03:16:07 +0000 2015,The Nats have a lot of expectations this year, and but they haven't lived up to the hype
609558090141331500,Sat Jun 13 03:09:08 +0000 2015,Santiago is doing a great job right when Anaheim needs it.
609557440766591000,Sat Jun 13 03:06:33 +0000 2015,The Price was right tonight #Tigers
609556526504747000,Sat Jun 13 03:02:55 +0000 2015,I don't know what the Blue Jays's players eat these days, but at this time of year they are unstoppable.
609199945485275100,Fri Jun 12 03:26:00 +0000 2015,Kazmir knows what he's doing, he has matured. He can serve any team, but it will be critical how well he finishes after the first half
608806225376088000,Thu Jun 11 01:21:29 +0000 2015,Transitioning from being a power pitcher to managing location...Where Weaver should be http://t.co/EsbYft0DHy
608805552391614500,Thu Jun 11 01:18:49 +0000 2015,Weaver needs to become  a Jamie Moyer-Tom Glavine type pitcher. He has to rely on location. Have the anxiety of the hitters do the job
608805016741232600,Thu Jun 11 01:16:41 +0000 2015,I think Volquez is in a place where he is finally settled and mature and know what he is doing
608802068443373600,Thu Jun 11 01:04:58 +0000 2015,Harvey is such a valuable piece. The Mets are playing with fire now. No Harvey, no Mets down the stretch
608800806184349700,Thu Jun 11 00:59:57 +0000 2015,Why is Harvey still in the game? He's not a four run pitcher. He doesn't have it today, so there's no need for him to be in there
608799814197911600,Thu Jun 11 00:56:01 +0000 2015,The Red Sox have shown inconsistency in all aspects of their game. I hope they're able to put it together.
608799628071440400,Thu Jun 11 00:55:16 +0000 2015,The Mets need to monitor Harvey because this is the time when pitchers start to feel fatigue and tiredness.
608799540058157000,Thu Jun 11 00:54:55 +0000 2015,The Giants don't overdo anything. They have the power and they use it when they need it.

608409807582806000,Tue Jun 09 23:06:16 +0000 2015,Because of the push Gonzalez has giving the Dodgers, he might be the reason why they are where they are right now. First baseman to ASG
608407028860633100,Tue Jun 09 22:55:13 +0000 2015,I felt I had no space for mistakes ...on the Journey to the Mayor Leagues http://t.co/eTYnxcs1Fh
608403704203628500,Tue Jun 09 22:42:01 +0000 2015,Cardinals are winning based on pitching, not so much offense. Pitching is their strength. They know how to play fundamentals in the game
608402733650071600,Tue Jun 09 22:38:09 +0000 2015,I think tonight the Nationals will get to Tanaka before the Yankees get to Scherzer.
608402312432918500,Tue Jun 09 22:36:29 +0000 2015,Jays have the complete package, Reyes healthy, Martin behind the plate, they need an ace like Hamels to stabilize the rest of the rotation
608401990356451300,Tue Jun 09 22:35:12 +0000 2015,Mets starters should hold on to what they've been doing. If they've to make any adjustments, work with someone like Bartolo who's a veteran
608399969398235100,Tue Jun 09 22:27:10 +0000 2015,I don't think Soriano wanted to be in the position of free agency.He always wanted to go out there and pitch.I hope he does well with Cubs
608399355788279800,Tue Jun 09 22:24:44 +0000 2015,A few years back baseball was about offense. Now it's about pitching. That's why pitchers are less intimidated to attack the strike zone.
608399010949414900,Tue Jun 09 22:23:22 +0000 2015,Michael Wacha might be the reason why the Cardinals are where they are.
608398837250715600,Tue Jun 09 22:22:40 +0000 2015,Michael Wacha seems to have mature. He's utilizing his change up and back up cutter to neutralize some lefties.

594994119518363600,Sun May 03 22:37:07 +0000 2015,Familia is a good closer that depending on how the Mets go, would have a good opportunity and could execute this time
594993604617228300,Sun May 03 22:35:04 +0000 2015,Although Guthrie will run into good hitting teams, once he faces flat teams he'll be able to put up some wins for the Royals
594993211174723600,Sun May 03 22:33:30 +0000 2015,Gee is a vacuum cleaner for the Mets http://t.co/L7dCN3jPMC

594984152165969900,Sun May 03 21:57:30 +0000 2015,Don't be surprised if you see Arenado in the All Star game and in contention for an MVP at the end of the year

594981709612974100,Sun May 03 21:47:48 +0000 2015,Weaver has to change things around a bit; has to rely on location, deception and cannot stay with the same pattern.

594632619830173700,Sat May 02 22:40:38 +0000 2015,The "shift" has made Moustakas a much better hitter, because it has forced him to learn how to go to the opposite field.
594632505808007200,Sat May 02 22:40:11 +0000 2015,I wouldnt like the "shift" to be happening while me pitching. I would trust the teammates behind me and their instincts.

594620377680195600,Sat May 02 21:52:00 +0000 2015,Gomes's tempo is a lot slower than last year; it doesn't matter what kind of catcher you have, you should be able to pick up your rhythm
594619625607929900,Sat May 02 21:49:00 +0000 2015,The Cardinals, they just know how to win, we cant count them out, they just know how to win
594614974628134900,Sat May 02 21:30:32 +0000 2015,I think losing Wainwright can help young pitchers like Wacha and the others in rotation to develop and mature.

594612416861884400,Sat May 02 21:20:22 +0000 2015,When you see young pitchers that go deep into post season, they usually have a setback starting next season.Their arms get overworked, tired
594610808941871100,Sat May 02 21:13:58 +0000 2015,If I ever faced Trout I would start him off away and early, never low. I would pretend I am challenging him with a fastball up.
594609822185726000,Sat May 02 21:10:03 +0000 2015,Everytime Super Man Trout gets a hold of a low and in pitch, he crashes the ball.
594608851908952000,Sat May 02 21:06:12 +0000 2015,I would hate to face Aoki if I was pitching. He has the flexibility to do anything.
594608216111210500,Sat May 02 21:03:40 +0000 2015,After winning a Cy Young, people never expect you to do any worse,the more magical your year is, the more they expect http://t.co/1dCYKav8Eu

594607489481584600,Sat May 02 21:00:47 +0000 2015,All I seem from Betances is he has stopper stuff. He's always on the strike zone 97 and 98 mph, with a nasty hook
594606770724679700,Sat May 02 20:57:56 +0000 2015,Young pitchers feed off what they see from the veterans.
594602695979302900,Sat May 02 20:41:44 +0000 2015,We were taught to go out there to try to complete the game, and if we couldn't do it then a reliever would come in http://t.co/bGn9p7osQt
594599229521268700,Sat May 02 20:27:58 +0000 2015,Liriano is a guy that's close to making the adjustments, he has learned how to understand his staff, his body and has taken advantage of it
594598814490751000,Sat May 02 20:26:19 +0000 2015,I think if you ever dream about becoming a pitcher and thinking about mental approach and mechanics, you dream about becoming Jhon Smoltz

594355753756024800,Sat May 02 04:20:28 +0000 2015,If I see a guy getting yammed during BP that means he doesn't have a quick bat
594353326512308200,Sat May 02 04:10:50 +0000 2015,If you don't have a good relationship with your catcher you take it to the tunnel and the next bullpen session and handle any issues

594342718089896000,Sat May 02 03:28:41 +0000 2015,The thin air doesn't bother Jorge De La Rosa because he's Mexican. He grew up breathing that thin air so that helps him
594341683036299300,Sat May 02 03:24:34 +0000 2015,Arenado seems like he can do everything. He's a player that's fun to watch, run the bases well,  hits well. He's rock solid
594340570127937500,Sat May 02 03:20:08 +0000 2015,Yadier Molina is the best catcher in baseball. He matured at the proper time.

593986156552937500,Fri May 01 03:51:50 +0000 2015,For Sabathia it's time to use the strike zone and the knowledge he has. Instead of behaving as a power pitcher he has to rely on location

593636175337881600,Thu Apr 30 04:41:08 +0000 2015,Although I feel proud, I don't think calling "Baby Pedro"to these 3 young pitchers its necessary;it puts too much pressure on them coming up
593632031277473800,Thu Apr 30 04:24:40 +0000 2015,Sox pitchers are missing location and that shouldn't be happening to pitchers that already have 2 to 3 years in the big leagues.

593631495127990300,Thu Apr 30 04:22:32 +0000 2015,Red Sox pitchers are capable of doing anything an ace could do. They have enough experience. They just seem to lose focus from time to time
593628585778352100,Thu Apr 30 04:10:58 +0000 2015,Los Mets necesitan dosificar a Harvey. No pueden darse el lujo de perderlo.
593628364705005600,Thu Apr 30 04:10:05 +0000 2015,The Mets need to pace Harvey because they can't afford to lose him. I don't think he could lose his rhythm due to the 6 man rotation.
593628061242908700,Thu Apr 30 04:08:53 +0000 2015,Cabrera has the ability to keep the barrel on top of the ball. He doesn't try to overdo anything. He doesn't over swing. He is a big boy
593626757170888700,Thu Apr 30 04:03:42 +0000 2015,I knew what hitters were looking for by just seeing their approach and their motion during BP.
593624053619040300,Thu Apr 30 03:52:58 +0000 2015,I drank 10 bottles of water in 2 hours. In 04' the whole pitching staff did the same, and none of them missed a start http://t.co/OSZmYAg61U
593623429468856300,Thu Apr 30 03:50:29 +0000 2015,I think Greinke is one of the smartest pitchers out there. He knows how to use what he has. He has good location.
593622790969888800,Thu Apr 30 03:47:57 +0000 2015,99 All Star Break was memorable for me because I saw the all Century players. At the end Ted Williams autographed a program dedicated to me

593615404272132100,Thu Apr 30 03:18:35 +0000 2015,There are two shocking things I've seen in this generation. The 94' suspension of the WS, and today's Orioles game with no fans in stadium

587096377722798100,Sun Apr 12 03:34:18 +0000 2015,For me it took about 3 to 4 times of taking Varitek to the bullpen for us to adjust and one outing. But after that we were great together
587095704524447700,Sun Apr 12 03:31:38 +0000 2015,It's so important to develop a good relationship with your catcher; so he would know what your pitches will do and the tendencies you have
587091941936013300,Sun Apr 12 03:16:41 +0000 2015,I love seeing Archie #Bradley giving credit to his catcher because they are one-two, and showing no fear against Kershaw

587088064582967300,Sun Apr 12 03:01:16 +0000 2015,We are a chain reaction when it comes to pitching. If pitching on top of a hurt knee, it can end up damaging your shoulder
587086801862529000,Sun Apr 12 02:56:15 +0000 2015,The Dodger way... http://t.co/OnsLNIc06m
587083233701015600,Sun Apr 12 02:42:05 +0000 2015,The #Dodger way is the drop and drive type of way. They teach to hook the rubber a little bit, so you can stay on your back leg.
587081327654101000,Sun Apr 12 02:34:30 +0000 2015,Miguel #Cabrera is amazing. Always worth watching #Tigers
587080277442351100,Sun Apr 12 02:30:20 +0000 2015,The playoffs have nothing to do with the way you compete all season. It's not that simple to overmatch or overpower teams in playoffs
587079356687786000,Sun Apr 12 02:26:40 +0000 2015,I think Clayton Kershaw is deceiving enough to fool anybody #Dodgers

587076222041096200,Sun Apr 12 02:14:13 +0000 2015,I think it's irresponsible to put something in your body and not consult with your trainers. You can't take that lightly as a player #Mejia

587073567101218800,Sun Apr 12 02:03:40 +0000 2015,For a pitcher sometimes it takes 3 or 4 outings to get the feel for the ball

586526582455586800,Fri Apr 10 13:50:09 +0000 2015,I don't think Tanaka is healthy. He might be better than a rushed up young pitcher but if they keep him like that it might bite them back
586525974759612400,Fri Apr 10 13:47:44 +0000 2015,Harvey's work ethics seems to be really good because I saw him way ahead than what I thought coming from the injury.

586377634973495300,Fri Apr 10 03:58:17 +0000 2015,To get ready for a start, I would watch batting practice and be eye balling everybody.
586377177609809900,Fri Apr 10 03:56:28 +0000 2015,You have to read hitters on the field.
586377139856916500,Fri Apr 10 03:56:19 +0000 2015,I like sabermetrics but you need to have an understanding of the bodies and abilities; it's not only about numbers and tendencies.
586374821140762600,Fri Apr 10 03:47:06 +0000 2015,I didn't grow up thinking about pitching limits. Felipe was great at protecting and reading me in #Expos when it came to pitching counts
586374640882200600,Fri Apr 10 03:46:23 +0000 2015,When I came up I was probably among the last generation of pitchers that had to prove themselves in the minor leagues and pitch pitch pitch

586372674521321500,Fri Apr 10 03:38:34 +0000 2015,Liriano is more mature. He learned in spite of being a short armer to keep away from injuries. He now he uses location. #Pirates
586372495214846000,Fri Apr 10 03:37:51 +0000 2015,Fernandez is a freak, so young, so powerful and yet have the feel to move the ball with so many different pitches. #Marlins
586372342953066500,Fri Apr 10 03:37:15 +0000 2015,I would correct Yordano a couple of things mechanically. He recoils a little bit. He has a small framed body. #Royals

586369684594942000,Fri Apr 10 03:26:41 +0000 2015,Harvey has to look at Clemens for fine-tuning his mechanics. Clemens was a veteran guy that understood his mechanics and knew what to do
586369217341091800,Fri Apr 10 03:24:50 +0000 2015,Gregg Maddux's landing and eye were straight to the target.  Andy Pettite had the best head I've seen when it came to targeting home plate.

586366728457826300,Fri Apr 10 03:14:56 +0000 2015,Strasburg back leg was leaning too soon. He does not have command of the front part. #Nationals
586366588330315800,Fri Apr 10 03:14:23 +0000 2015,Harvey was taking control of his body and guiding it really well #Mets
586366398718443500,Fri Apr 10 03:13:38 +0000 2015,As a pitcher you have to stay on top and in command of your upper body. You don't want your back leg to feel what your front leg is doing.

522235943156461600,Wed Oct 15 04:02:06 +0000 2014,The Orioles are equally as talented and equally as capable to do what we did in 2004
522235661420863500,Wed Oct 15 04:00:59 +0000 2014,If the Orioles see themselves right now where they are, all they have to think is: if the Sox pull it out in 04, we can do it too.
522234872841375740,Wed Oct 15 03:57:51 +0000 2014,In 03 we were all pretty sad and a little bit sarcastic I didn't expect for us to find that match but when I saw that fuel,it was everything
522229852523728900,Wed Oct 15 03:37:54 +0000 2014,En mis 18 años de carrera, nunca he visto una defensa en post temporada como la de Kansas City
522229464772902900,Wed Oct 15 03:36:21 +0000 2014,In my 18 year career, I have never seen a defense like this in the playoffs, a daily consistent defense.
522228723358375940,Wed Oct 15 03:33:24 +0000 2014,As a pitcher you have to know your place and what you want to do precisely on that play to be able to get an out. Choate wasn't ready
522228068241657860,Wed Oct 15 03:30:48 +0000 2014,This kid surprised me and everybody ,he came back and made quality pitches. It was unexpected for a guy that didn't pitch for 19 days
522227314206056450,Wed Oct 15 03:27:48 +0000 2014,El.equipo completo de Kansas City esta completamente enfocado. Es impresionante ver eso en un equipo tan joven
522227183667142660,Wed Oct 15 03:27:17 +0000 2014,Hay que quitarse el sombrero delante de los KC Royals, y desear que les vaya bien
522227068739018750,Wed Oct 15 03:26:50 +0000 2014,You just have to tip your hat to the Kansas City Royals and wish them well.
522226846055014400,Wed Oct 15 03:25:57 +0000 2014,Well I can relate to what's happening to KC, the same thing happen in 03. Just like the Yankees did to us, they're doing it to Baltimore.
522225285279019000,Wed Oct 15 03:19:45 +0000 2014,Que atleta es Lorenzo Cain, increible
522225129213157400,Wed Oct 15 03:19:07 +0000 2014,The whole KC team, you can look at them in the eyes and they are all focus, and that impresses me from this young team
522224901684748300,Wed Oct 15 03:18:13 +0000 2014,The Moussss is loose and they can't stop him
522224696428072960,Wed Oct 15 03:17:24 +0000 2014,Cain is amazing that kid, what an athlete!
522224581466415100,Wed Oct 15 03:16:57 +0000 2014,Its funny but I never got a chance to look at this from this side, today I feel like a fan of the Kansas City royals.

522175884586135550,Wed Oct 15 00:03:27 +0000 2014,Con esa actitud de Pearce, yo como lanzador, le lanzo lo mismo una y otra vez para provocarle la misma frustración
522175599176351740,Wed Oct 15 00:02:19 +0000 2014,Adam Jones sabe como dar sus galletas, pero se esta poniendo mucha presión. El no es un jugador que entra en pánico
522175301615620100,Wed Oct 15 00:01:08 +0000 2014,Cain es un jugador que ha puesto su ego detrás y ha hecho todo lo que el equipo le ha pedido, rodados, elevados, robado de bases. No hay ego
522174579801071600,Tue Oct 14 23:58:16 +0000 2014,Cain is a guy who has no ego, he would take whatever the team ask him to do, groundballs, flyballs, steal bases. No ego there
522174157854105600,Tue Oct 14 23:56:35 +0000 2014,Adam Jones knows how to hit a "galleta", but he is putting too much pressure on himself. He is a no panic guy
522173685495779300,Tue Oct 14 23:54:42 +0000 2014,With Pearce attitude, I would going in and try to execute the same pitches and provoke the same frustration, is I was the opposite pitcher
522173310562738200,Tue Oct 14 23:53:13 +0000 2014,If I'm on the other side, I think about Pearce, guess what the doctor ordered? If I'm in the jungle and alive he's the perfect meal for me

521098678212501500,Sun Oct 12 00:43:01 +0000 2014,Cain is indescribable as far as his defense. I have nothing but good words on the way he has shown up to play.
521098398246924300,Sun Oct 12 00:41:54 +0000 2014,I think leaving Ventura into the 6th inning was just stretching the extra mile.
521098236942364700,Sun Oct 12 00:41:15 +0000 2014,I think Ned Yost should've realize that Venutra wasn't on from the first inning. He wasn't there mentally.
521098132856512500,Sun Oct 12 00:40:51 +0000 2014,That is why I said you pick your poison when you play against the KC Royas. They're not easy to beat right now.
521096699016921100,Sun Oct 12 00:35:09 +0000 2014,I don't think I have ever seen more exciting baseball...Kansas City esta "fuera de liga". I would pay my money to go see them play
521031079734837250,Sat Oct 11 20:14:24 +0000 2014,Markakis es un jugador de cinco herramientas, pero subestimado. Creo que sera un mejor jugador de lo que la gente piensa
521030697629548540,Sat Oct 11 20:12:53 +0000 2014,Anoche no podia dormir pensando en todas las locuras que ocurrieron en el primer juego.
521026363613265900,Sat Oct 11 19:55:39 +0000 2014,Veo en Salvador Perez a un Molina mas joven, Es inteligente, y tiene un gran futuro. El ha estado lidereando el equipo en el terreno
521026089192534000,Sat Oct 11 19:54:34 +0000 2014,Para un lanzador es un gran empuje el tener una defensa como la que tiene Kansas City ahora mismo.
521025680025600000,Sat Oct 11 19:52:56 +0000 2014,You don't expect The Mous has been unexpected. Instead of being an easy out, he is having power. He scary right now and he swinging the bat
521025195344412700,Sat Oct 11 19:51:01 +0000 2014,I see in Salvador Perez a young Molina. He's smart, has a bright future and he is carrying the team on the field by taking leadership
521024601359650800,Sat Oct 11 19:48:39 +0000 2014,For a pitcher it gives you a great push to know you will have the type of defense the Royals are showing
521024345574228000,Sat Oct 11 19:47:38 +0000 2014,Markakis is a five tool player, he is very underrated but I think he will be a better player than people think.
521023502074527740,Sat Oct 11 19:44:17 +0000 2014,I could not fall asleep last night thinking about everything that happened in the game last night

520817850962169860,Sat Oct 11 06:07:06 +0000 2014,Hosmer is a young player and trying to carry the team. Although he was good tonight, I think the manager needs to help him hold on strikes
520812676629659650,Sat Oct 11 05:46:33 +0000 2014,Cuando Wainwright esta "como es" su recta tiene buena localización. Y por sus expresiones en las primeras dos entradas, ya se sabe como esta
520812120766951400,Sat Oct 11 05:44:20 +0000 2014,"My daddy" de la noche va para Wade Davis. Las dos entradas que lanzo para KC fueron esenciales para la victoria
520808604409298940,Sat Oct 11 05:30:22 +0000 2014,My daddy for tonight is Wade Davis. Those two beautiful innings pitched for KC were important for the team to get the win.
520807759303168000,Sat Oct 11 05:27:00 +0000 2014,When Wainwright is right, he spots the fastball well. By his expressions in the first two innings you can tell how he feels right away.
520807088705241100,Sat Oct 11 05:24:20 +0000 2014,I think Bumgarner wont try to think about what he did wrong in the past. He will just try to set up the tone for this upcoming game.
520804800758575100,Sat Oct 11 05:15:15 +0000 2014,Lo que mas veo en Shields es inconsistencia. Inicio con pitcheos de calidad pero luego hizo mediocres.Creo que pierde el enfoque en el juego
520804146342273000,Sat Oct 11 05:12:39 +0000 2014,I see inconsistency in Shields, more than anything else.
520803999382253600,Sat Oct 11 05:12:04 +0000 2014,Shields started making quality pitches early in the game, but then he made mediocre ones. I think he loses focus as the game goes on.
520802293214871550,Sat Oct 11 05:05:17 +0000 2014,The Mous got looseeeeee
520801836459388900,Sat Oct 11 05:03:28 +0000 2014,The KC outfielders are just state troopers, chasing everyone, but nobody can chase them.
520801652694323200,Sat Oct 11 05:02:44 +0000 2014,KC stopped a lot of runs by playing good defense. In the outfield they looked like they were state troopers, they chased everybody all over
520801214020472800,Sat Oct 11 05:01:00 +0000 2014,Kansas City team is what the fans really expected to see, full of energy and momentum. I think they are having a great time.
520725484720914400,Sat Oct 11 00:00:04 +0000 2014,I have to go with Orioles for tonight, because they have plenty of time to set up the team, and set up a plan.
520724461348483100,Fri Oct 10 23:56:00 +0000 2014,You have to keep your composure in the middle of a crowd like this. Get a couple of innings in, and settle down.
520724417866137600,Fri Oct 10 23:55:50 +0000 2014,Impressive what the Orioles were capable of doing, the speed, good defense and timely hitting. The post season is the best time for them.
520723640837750800,Fri Oct 10 23:52:45 +0000 2014,Shields looks relaxed and focus. This is the time of year you feel a little fatigue but no time to think about it. You just have to go.
520723124925759500,Fri Oct 10 23:50:42 +0000 2014,For Nelson Cruz this is a good sign for him to see that Duquette is willing to pull the trigger.
520722856335114240,Fri Oct 10 23:49:38 +0000 2014,Signing JJ Hardy it's a typical Dan Duquette move, that's the type of GM he is, very professional and knows how to go about his business
520721840193691650,Fri Oct 10 23:45:35 +0000 2014,Showalter went out of the ordinary walking in the winning run,but he was reallly aware and he took Ausmus to school as far as managing.
520720739914489860,Fri Oct 10 23:41:13 +0000 2014,Tillman will have to save some energy because this is a game of lingering. Whoever lingers more will win it.
520720521265414140,Fri Oct 10 23:40:21 +0000 2014,Shields is gonna have to establish his fastballs but with quality strike. strikes good enough to confuse umpires and to confuse the offense
520719821135437800,Fri Oct 10 23:37:34 +0000 2014,KC has the talent, momentum and energy and they are resilient. They don't want to give it up.

518972814041559040,Mon Oct 06 03:55:35 +0000 2014,Norris is a replica of Roger Clemens; he has the same mannerism, looks a bit like him, and does everything Clemens does when he is pitching
518971609894637600,Mon Oct 06 03:50:48 +0000 2014,The third base umpire should have seen it and should have said something on that second call, Bal-Detroit infield play.
518971072134537200,Mon Oct 06 03:48:40 +0000 2014,La defensa, el relevo, el coraje, entusiasmo y el momentum, Todos esos elementos contribuyeron a la victoria de Kansas City
518970825509449700,Mon Oct 06 03:47:41 +0000 2014,El equipo de KC detuvo todo momento que Anaheim tuvo para anotar carreras. Los outfielders cubrieron mucho terreno.
518970627957747700,Mon Oct 06 03:46:54 +0000 2014,No tengo palabras para felicitar la defensa de los Kansas City Royals.
518969688647544800,Mon Oct 06 03:43:10 +0000 2014,The defense combined with good relievers, lots of guts, excitement and momentum. All of that did it for the Royals today
518969276150321150,Mon Oct 06 03:41:32 +0000 2014,The Royals killed every single momentum that Anaheim tried; they prevented so many runs. The outfielders cover so much ground.
518968343773335550,Mon Oct 06 03:37:49 +0000 2014,I dont have enough words to praise the KC defense
518967164876103700,Mon Oct 06 03:33:08 +0000 2014,KC are a loose bunch, I hope they have fun. I am very happy to see small markets teams go at each other.
518966997921832960,Mon Oct 06 03:32:28 +0000 2014,I said it, CJ had to keep his composure and he didn't and it ended up being a long night for Anaheim.
518966884755308540,Mon Oct 06 03:32:01 +0000 2014,The Mouss is loose......uh kill em
518850299889729540,Sun Oct 05 19:48:45 +0000 2014,Creo que David Price hará un buen trabajo. Pueda que Norris sea mejor contrincante para que Detroit haga carreras temprano en el juego.
518849188562739200,Sun Oct 05 19:44:20 +0000 2014,Pero, igualmente puede ser una desventaja, porque entonces no tiene suficiente tiempo para preparar el plan de juego y lo que enfrentaras.
518848785024569340,Sun Oct 05 19:42:44 +0000 2014,Para Norris el no saber que lanzaria, hasta el ultimo minuto puede ser ventaja. Eso hace que no tengas que pensar mucho. El es maduro.
518847472886886400,Sun Oct 05 19:37:31 +0000 2014,Price should be worth the price.
518847412409221100,Sun Oct 05 19:37:17 +0000 2014,I think DAvid Price will come up big. Norris is a better matchup for Detroit to get some runs early, specially the top part of the line up
518846208182603800,Sun Oct 05 19:32:30 +0000 2014,CJ Wilson has been a little bit fast on top of the rubber, not executing control over his pitches. He needs to attack the strike zone more.
518845389928402940,Sun Oct 05 19:29:15 +0000 2014,Yordano gave me a call after the game and told me how excited and relevied he felt about pitching a good game. Eric Hasmer really hyped up
518844342174507000,Sun Oct 05 19:25:05 +0000 2014,En el clima frio se pone reseco, y los pitchers tienen dificultad en el agarre de la pelota. La humedad es importante en las manos
518844012560941060,Sun Oct 05 19:23:46 +0000 2014,Si Detroit quiere seguir en la pelea, debe darse cuenta que Joba y Soria no son la opcion. Nathan salvo 300 juegos y no es coincidencia.
518843186933141500,Sun Oct 05 19:20:30 +0000 2014,It is no coincidence that Nathan has 300 saves in the Majors.
518843049523564540,Sun Oct 05 19:19:57 +0000 2014,If Tigers want to have another chance at this time they need to realize that not Joba or Soria are the answer. Please give Nathan a chance
518842610509971460,Sun Oct 05 19:18:12 +0000 2014,Or it could be a disadvantage to know last minute, because you don't have enough time to prepare yourself and the challenges you'll face
518842249745297400,Sun Oct 05 19:16:46 +0000 2014,For Norris It could work to his advantage not thinking too much on what he has to do, on a last minute notice of him pitching. He's mature
518841479943700500,Sun Oct 05 19:13:43 +0000 2014,In cold weather pitchers just need to get a heat pack inside your jacket so the hands stay warm and humid.
518841110303895550,Sun Oct 05 19:12:14 +0000 2014,In the cold weather it gets a little dryer,you have a harder time gripping the ball.For a pitcher the humidity in your hands its important
518840197564620800,Sun Oct 05 19:08:37 +0000 2014,In a situation like last night, I think it would have been the first time I would've face my manager and tell him I want to keep the ball
518558631072378900,Sun Oct 05 00:29:46 +0000 2014,Zimmerman hizo tremendo trabajo. Yo no hubiera entregado la pelota en ese ultimo out.
518557861262393340,Sun Oct 05 00:26:43 +0000 2014,Zimmerman did an outstanding job. I don't know that I would have given away the ball on that last out

518284147664912400,Sat Oct 04 06:19:04 +0000 2014,Don't go to bed just yet....
518283548202401800,Sat Oct 04 06:16:41 +0000 2014,Anibal Sanchez pitched those two innings with no stress. The Orioles couldn't read Sanchez pitches.
518281933089173500,Sat Oct 04 06:10:16 +0000 2014,Romo has being a big factor for his team, a stopper, middle reliever, long reliever, this kid is special.
518281669900767200,Sat Oct 04 06:09:13 +0000 2014,Peavy way to go bro, that's what you live for! Love seeing you out there
518281436424855550,Sat Oct 04 06:08:18 +0000 2014,I think Molina's outburst will cost him money,just by saying something inappropriate to an umpire costs you money.I hope he doesn't get hit
518280889655382000,Sat Oct 04 06:06:07 +0000 2014,I remember last year Kershaw being out there when he didn't have to be.It's time for Mattingly and pitching coach to keep their eyes on him
518279650028838900,Sat Oct 04 06:01:12 +0000 2014,Seen Kershaw it hurts and it has you thinking for probably two days, he has a lot to work to do still. But I'm not worried, he is human too.
518277196214190100,Sat Oct 04 05:51:27 +0000 2014,Kershaw was missing location and probably a little sign of fatigue. Cardinals took advantage of it.
518276899278446600,Sat Oct 04 05:50:16 +0000 2014,Dyson is underrated, but I was impressed with how he turned out that double play. Pure arm strength. I tip my cap to him. Very sleek.
518275007668297700,Sat Oct 04 05:42:45 +0000 2014,Yordano showed up like nothing happened, like a cold blooded killer.
518274899140677600,Sat Oct 04 05:42:19 +0000 2014,I predicted that he was going to have a good feel for the ball. I didn't expect him he was going to be that strong. He had poise, maturity
518274633217617900,Sat Oct 04 05:41:16 +0000 2014,Lorenzo Cain is the black Giraffe...la Jirafa negra
518273862199705600,Sat Oct 04 05:38:12 +0000 2014,I am extremely proud of these kids, both of them did a good job.Yordano had the determination to go and challenge those hitters.
518252206563541000,Sat Oct 04 04:12:09 +0000 2014,"Ohhhhhh kill em...." Jajajaja(let's see who wins the terio song)...Angels or Royals?
518251199943172100,Sat Oct 04 04:08:09 +0000 2014,Yordano, mision cumplida. Que orgullo. Yordano, mission accomplished. Proud of you...
518217578008027140,Sat Oct 04 01:54:33 +0000 2014,@MikeSilvermanBB Silverrrrr, it is en ingles amigo...antes que en español...I just translate them all together afterwards
518217133218861060,Sat Oct 04 01:52:47 +0000 2014,Yordano necesita relajarse y olvidarse de lo que paso dias atrás. Que lanze normal. Lo único que me preocupa es que tanto duración tenga.
518216889609490400,Sat Oct 04 01:51:49 +0000 2014,A Yost que recuerde que al monstruo de varias cabezas en su bullpen le fue arrancada una. No se que hará con Yordano, pero me preocupa
518216380999819260,Sat Oct 04 01:49:47 +0000 2014,Shoemaker es joven y lleno de energía, pero esta viniendo de una lesión y tiene que saber como administrarse, para medir su cuerpo.
518216117756915700,Sat Oct 04 01:48:45 +0000 2014,Para un abridor, 15 lanzamientos en un inning es un buen inning. Anibal Sanchez iba bien contra los Orioles, el ni llego a sudar.
518215735982968800,Sat Oct 04 01:47:14 +0000 2014,Que va a hacer Ausmus con Anibal Sanchez? Guardarlo para el año que viene? En octubre, eso no vale. En octubre no hay "año que viene"
518215287976767500,Sat Oct 04 01:45:27 +0000 2014,A veces el juego se ve mas facil desde el estudio de televisión, que del terreno. Se entiende que habrá errores, pero no siempre excusas.
518214957796954100,Sat Oct 04 01:44:08 +0000 2014,Brad Ausmus es un manager novato, y esta bien que cometa errores, pero no des excusas. No se lidiar con excusas en este juego
518214280010022900,Sat Oct 04 01:41:26 +0000 2014,Por respeto Ausmus debió darle la pelota a Nathan hoy, pero le dio el chance a Chamberlain y Soria, que no tienen tanta experiencia en post
518213905437720600,Sat Oct 04 01:39:57 +0000 2014,Me agrada Peavy y la forma en que se maneja. Me gusto ver su energía hoy en el juego, creo que se mantuvo calmado demasiado tiempo.
518212420456947700,Sat Oct 04 01:34:03 +0000 2014,I love Peavy and the way he goes about his business. I love that he was fired up today, I think he hold it up for a little too long.
518211636549918700,Sat Oct 04 01:30:56 +0000 2014,Why not out of respect give the ball to Nathan to get out; instead Ausmus went to Chamberlain and Soria who have no experience in playoffs.
518210493035872260,Sat Oct 04 01:26:24 +0000 2014,Brad Ausmus is a rookie manager, and it's ok to make a mistake. Just don't give excuses, I can't deal with excuses.
518209714996641800,Sat Oct 04 01:23:18 +0000 2014,Sometimes the game seems a lot easier from the broadcast booth than the actual field; it's ok to make a mistake, just don't give excuses
518209295222329340,Sat Oct 04 01:21:38 +0000 2014,What are you going to save Anibal Sanchez for? Next year? There is no next year in October.
518209034881871900,Sat Oct 04 01:20:36 +0000 2014,As a starting pitcher 15 pitches an inning is a good inning.Anibal Sanchez was dealing easily with the Orioles,he didn't even break a sweat.
518207375103496200,Sat Oct 04 01:14:00 +0000 2014,Shoemaker is young and full of energy, but he is coming off an injury, he will have to pace himself and go thourgh the motions.
518206562402594800,Sat Oct 04 01:10:46 +0000 2014,Ned Yost has to remember that they are missing one of the big headed monsters in their bullpen. I don't know how he will do it with Yordano
518206238606508000,Sat Oct 04 01:09:29 +0000 2014,Yordano needs to relax and forget about the other day, and go on about his business.But I worry about how long they can keep him in the game
518118396492546050,Fri Oct 03 19:20:26 +0000 2014,@KMillar15 Mi niño 15 donde estas ahora?
518118085468114940,Fri Oct 03 19:19:12 +0000 2014,@KMillar15 Mi niñooooooo 15 keeping an eye on you Bro...any tips?
518117632701378560,Fri Oct 03 19:17:24 +0000 2014,@garysheffield @CaseyStern Don't be surprised if a team calls for you later as a hitting coach Bro! Yeahhhh
518071421940285440,Fri Oct 03 16:13:46 +0000 2014,Odiaba enfrentar bateadores que me hacían lanzar mucho como Edgar Martinez y Robbie Alomar. Kinsler hizo eso mismo ayer a Tillman y lo cansó
518070993408241660,Fri Oct 03 16:12:04 +0000 2014,Si yo fuera Brad Ausmus, consideraría a Porcello para llenar espacios. Porcello tirar strikes, estabiliza todo y es versátil
518070705523810300,Fri Oct 03 16:10:56 +0000 2014,Yin Chen es engañoso y tiene muchas herramientas.El saca outs sigilosamente y puede estar en el juego lo suficiente para obtener la victoria
518069750052945900,Fri Oct 03 16:07:08 +0000 2014,Verlander le ha dado carácter al equipo de Detroit, cuando se trata de lanzar. El va a lanzar bien, como siempre lo hace.
518069484096356350,Fri Oct 03 16:06:04 +0000 2014,Verlander tiene lo que se llama pedigree, cuando se trata de situaciones bajo presión. No se puede perder la fe en el.
518069104750919700,Fri Oct 03 16:04:34 +0000 2014,Kansas City esta jugando buena pelota, buenos fundamentos, y estan haciendo las cosas correctamente.
518068891843846140,Fri Oct 03 16:03:43 +0000 2014,Kansas City esta empezando a sentirse cómodo, y a jugar como que ellos pertenecen. Si me preguntan a mi, ahora mismo es el mejor equipo.
518067493722918900,Fri Oct 03 15:58:10 +0000 2014,I hated those guys that took a lot of pitches,like Edgar Martinez and Robbie Alomar. Kinsler did a great job yesterday getting Tillman tired
518065725911879700,Fri Oct 03 15:51:08 +0000 2014,If I was Brad Ausmus, I will really consider Porcello to fill up the gap. Porcello can throw strikes, stabilizes everything, he is versatile
518065057406926850,Fri Oct 03 15:48:29 +0000 2014,Yin Chen is very deceiving and resourceful. He battles you in a quite way and he will linger around long enough to put a win for his team.
518063380251574300,Fri Oct 03 15:41:49 +0000 2014,Verlander it's the guy to be, and he is going to put on a great time, like he always does.
518063040491962400,Fri Oct 03 15:40:28 +0000 2014,Verlander has a pedigree, when it comes to crunch time, you can't lose faith on a guy like him, he has given Detroit character when pitching
518062704972824600,Fri Oct 03 15:39:08 +0000 2014,Kansas City is playing small baseball, and doing things right.
518062353146183700,Fri Oct 03 15:37:44 +0000 2014,The Royals are starting to feel comfortable and playing as they belonged. If you ask me who the best team in baseball is the Royals.

517918732296155140,Fri Oct 03 06:07:02 +0000 2014,I am gonna go with two daddys today, one Latino and one American....the Dominican, Nelson Cruz and the "Mous" Mike Moustaka. Yeahhhhh
517917994610348000,Fri Oct 03 06:04:07 +0000 2014,Kershaw tiene lo que necesita para ganarle a los Cardenales.Su mecánica confunde,es difícil de batear y tiene distintos ángulos y posiciones
517917486390734850,Fri Oct 03 06:02:05 +0000 2014,Kershaw has what it takes to beat the Cardinals; his mechanics are deceiving, tough to hit and has different angles and positions.
517916760033730560,Fri Oct 03 05:59:12 +0000 2014,Kershaw has all 4 pitches, he's healthy, with more experience than last year.I don't expect the same post season, because he's more mature.
517915288571224060,Fri Oct 03 05:53:21 +0000 2014,Kansas City sigue ayudando a su manager Ned Yost. No es nada personal, pero el haber dejado a Vargas en el juego, no fue un buen movimiento
517914774496358400,Fri Oct 03 05:51:19 +0000 2014,Los lanzadores de Kansas City vendrán mañana confiados en su defensa. Ellos desafiaran a los rivales, pero descansaran en su defensa.
517914495436726300,Fri Oct 03 05:50:12 +0000 2014,Showalter hizo todos los movimientos que tenia que hacer en el juego de hoy. Para mi, eso es lo que un buen manager debe hacer.
517914039939506200,Fri Oct 03 05:48:24 +0000 2014,I think Showalter hit every single button he had to hit at the right moment. To me that's what I expect from a good manager.
517913471737143300,Fri Oct 03 05:46:08 +0000 2014,Creo que Tillman estaba tan entusiasmado en el primer inning que le afecto en el segundo inning. Demasiada adrenalina en este juego.
517912432770285600,Fri Oct 03 05:42:00 +0000 2014,Nadie del Bullpen de Detroit impresiono a nadie. Creo que los Tigres están en problemas con sus relevistas.
517911891449233400,Fri Oct 03 05:39:51 +0000 2014,Nobody that came out of the Detroit bullpen impressed anybody. I think Detroit it's in trouble as far as the bullpen its concerned.
517911607989796860,Fri Oct 03 05:38:44 +0000 2014,I think Tillman was so hyped up in that first inning, that if affected him in the second inning. Too much adrenaline during that game.
517910873114161150,Fri Oct 03 05:35:49 +0000 2014,Royals pitchers are going home and when they come back tomorrow all they have to do is challenge those guys and let the defense take over.
517910258388582400,Fri Oct 03 05:33:22 +0000 2014,But, thank God Yost,ended up in a good way. The Royals played good defense,never gave up and showed that they belonged. I'm rooting for them
517909722901778400,Fri Oct 03 05:31:14 +0000 2014,The Royals are picking up Ned Yost all the way. He probably thinks I don't like him but that move of leaving Vargas in there, was a bad one
517908444226281500,Fri Oct 03 05:26:10 +0000 2014,The "Mous" went deep, big time, and gave Kansas City the win.
517790235993079800,Thu Oct 02 21:36:27 +0000 2014,Tillman es difícil de enfrentar, por el ángulo del brazo, tiene buen movimiento, buena recta; no ha tenido post-temporada pero es seguro.
517789750007443460,Thu Oct 02 21:34:31 +0000 2014,Creo que Scherzer es el paquete completo, ha llegado al punto de madurez y ha estado en el juego tiempo suficiente. El es el "real deal"
517788645215182850,Thu Oct 02 21:30:07 +0000 2014,Vargas es un lanzador fino, y tiene el coraje para lanzar, pero tendrá que ser casi perfecto, para controlar la ofensiva de los Angelinos
517788162715058200,Thu Oct 02 21:28:12 +0000 2014,Mi sugerencia al bullpen de los Gigantes: recuerden que el juego no cambia, nosotros cambiamos de acuerdo a como nos manejemos bajo presión.
517787687504580600,Thu Oct 02 21:26:19 +0000 2014,Vargas is a finesse pitcher and has the guts to do it, but he's gonna have to be near perfect to control that Angels offense.
517786905468223500,Thu Oct 02 21:23:12 +0000 2014,The Tigers bullpen have those two guys, Anibal Sanchez and Porcello , they are able to get two or three outs there, after Scherzer.
517786250569609200,Thu Oct 02 21:20:36 +0000 2014,My advice to the young Giants bullpen: the game doesn't change, we make it change according to the way we behave as the spot comes over.
517785318507184100,Thu Oct 02 21:16:54 +0000 2014,Tillman is very difficult to pick up on the arm angle, has good movement, good fastball; it doesn't matter he doesn't have post season exp..
517784462487461900,Thu Oct 02 21:13:30 +0000 2014,I think Scherzer is a complete package,he has reached a point where he is mature,  and has been around long enough. He is the real deal
517395676482011140,Wed Oct 01 19:28:36 +0000 2014,A day like today was born one of my biggest gifts, my wife Carolina. Happy bday!!@miacarolina45

517192296224530400,Wed Oct 01 06:00:27 +0000 2014,Finnegan es un jovencito que apenas salió de la universidad. Sin embargo el tomo control del equipo y lo mantuvo. Tendra un gran futuro
517190063642652700,Wed Oct 01 05:51:34 +0000 2014,A veces hay que cuestionar las decisiones de los managers. Que pensaba Ned Yost al poner a Yordano Ventura a lanzar en una 6ta entrada?
517187903248932860,Wed Oct 01 05:42:59 +0000 2014,Who's my daddy? I choose Brandon Moss, he gave the team all the momentum they need it with the 2 homeruns.
517186997749026800,Wed Oct 01 05:39:23 +0000 2014,Volquez necesita establecer su comando temprano en el juego y usar su cambio efectivamente. Tendra que lanzar a una alineación veterana
517186568961142800,Wed Oct 01 05:37:41 +0000 2014,Volquez needs to establish his command early and use his change up effectively. He's gonna have to make pitches to get over the veterans.
517186001761226750,Wed Oct 01 05:35:26 +0000 2014,The experience that Bumgarner brings plays a big role, he is a cold blooded kid. He doesn't seem to get rattle in a game.
517183905506820100,Wed Oct 01 05:27:06 +0000 2014,Ventura, keep you head high, you have a bright future.
517183758504837100,Wed Oct 01 05:26:31 +0000 2014,Ventura, don't feel bad about this move; it's not your fault, it's Yost fault. You should've never come out in a situation like this.
517182986664816640,Wed Oct 01 05:23:27 +0000 2014,What Ned Yost it's saying about bringing in Ventura, it's horrible. How much gas do you want? Why don't you just go and get a gas station?
517182362405584900,Wed Oct 01 05:20:58 +0000 2014,Sometimes you have to question and second guess some of the movements managers make. What was Yost thinking when he brought Ventura in?
517182094406352900,Wed Oct 01 05:19:54 +0000 2014,Ventura: Mi niño,no es tu culpa,estas no son situaciones donde tu debes salir. Toda la culpa es de Yost, levanta la cabeza; tienes un futuro
517181540225527800,Wed Oct 01 05:17:42 +0000 2014,I think Ned Yost had a panic move and almost gave the game again. If they would have lost, he would have been the ugly goat.
517180702245543940,Wed Oct 01 05:14:22 +0000 2014,Finnegan is a kid out of college, that just pitched at the college WS, but came in and settled the whole team down. Great for him.
517180088895701000,Wed Oct 01 05:11:56 +0000 2014,I think Ned Yost was trying to give away this game, in any way possible. I dont agree with the situation of putting Ventura into the 6th
517099513073655800,Tue Sep 30 23:51:45 +0000 2014,Si el equipo de Kansas City logra correr las bases, Shields solo tiene que llegar hasta la 5ta entrada. De ahi, los relevistas se encargan
517098994913509400,Tue Sep 30 23:49:42 +0000 2014,If those guys get on base, Kansas City has a huge advantage...If Shields can hold them till the 5th inning, the bullpen just has to come in
517098586019205100,Tue Sep 30 23:48:04 +0000 2014,On Oakland: One swing by Adam Dunn can be traumatic...un swing de Adam Dunn, puede virar el juego
517097905707302900,Tue Sep 30 23:45:22 +0000 2014,Si Lester se enfrenta a esos corredores que son molestosos en las bases, eso puede ser un dolor de cabeza para el.
517097431415398400,Tue Sep 30 23:43:29 +0000 2014,En la postemporada los lanzadores deben mantener la compostura, sin alterar su mecánica, y deben ser certeros con los lanzamientos.
517096697420587000,Tue Sep 30 23:40:34 +0000 2014,On Lester: If those pesky hitters get on base, they can become a headache for him
517096253935853600,Tue Sep 30 23:38:48 +0000 2014,Keep your composure, not altering your mechanics and hitting your spots...that's you've got to do in the playoffs...

513752259235418100,Sun Sep 21 18:10:58 +0000 2014,Kershaw es especial. Y no es pura coinicidencia; es consistente, tiene mentalidad definida y un programa a ejecutar. Me agrada ver eso.
513751800332419100,Sun Sep 21 18:09:08 +0000 2014,Kershaw it's special,and it's not just coincidence;he's consistent, he has a mindset and a program to execute.It's lovely for me to see this
513750999396536300,Sun Sep 21 18:05:57 +0000 2014,Los Nacionales no tienen mucha experiencia y han demostrado inconsistencia. Temo que no puedan mantener el momentum.
513750339661856800,Sun Sep 21 18:03:20 +0000 2014,The Nationals are a bit inexperienced and have shown inconsistency. I'm afraid they wont be able to carry the momentum.
513749939122606100,Sun Sep 21 18:01:45 +0000 2014,Los tigeres de Detroit son como un monstruo de nueve cabezas cada vez que salen. Tienen la mejor rotación abridora, y la experiencia.
513749660545331200,Sun Sep 21 18:00:38 +0000 2014,The tigers are like a nine-headed monster every time they go out. They have the best starting rotation with the experience to go get it.
