735173683136733200,Tue May 24 18:20:39 +0000 2016,Davidson has had a grueling tourney: 4 three-setters in a row (although didn't finish vs Vandy yesterday). Might be weighing on her now.

734857665822625800,Mon May 23 21:24:55 +0000 2016,Lampl has now clinched more than twice as many matches as any other Cardinal this season: Seven times. Next closest it 3.
734857073800814600,Mon May 23 21:22:34 +0000 2016,YESSSSSSSSSS
734856993345671200,Mon May 23 21:22:14 +0000 2016,That hurts a little. Lampl swings big at FH volley and its goes feet long. Two more MPs
734856846884753400,Mon May 23 21:21:39 +0000 2016,Contreras attempts a big get and the ball lands just barely wide. Triple MP
734856298253017100,Mon May 23 21:19:29 +0000 2016,Insane. Lampl finally converts 3rd hold pt by ripping BHDTL winner. Up 5-3*. One game away from sending Card to finals.
734854421188730900,Mon May 23 21:12:01 +0000 2016,Lampl takes 4th game in a row by converting on 1st hold pt, 40-30. Rock solid and still going for her shots. 4-2*
734854079390703600,Mon May 23 21:10:40 +0000 2016,Contreras overruled at 30-30 to give Lampl hold point. It was an insane FH inside out angle that Lampl ripped.
734853309853376500,Mon May 23 21:07:36 +0000 2016,HUGE break. Lampl wins 3rd consecutive game, 3*-2. She's going to have to keep staying cool against countless saves &amp; slices from Contreras.

734839785739558900,Mon May 23 20:13:52 +0000 2016,Zhao holds at love to go up 5-3, featuring ace, ovh and Vandy unforced error on long groundstroke. Time to close
734839188302925800,Mon May 23 20:11:29 +0000 2016,Zhao converts 30-40 to break and go up 4-3 in 2nd set. She's executing a patient, tactical game; difficult to do vs heavy-hitter indoors
734837563312083000,Mon May 23 20:05:02 +0000 2016,This could be one of those college tennis dual match moments when momentum shifts. Vandy forced 3rd set Crt 6, up 3-1* Crt 5, up 1*-0 Crt 2
734836876696113200,Mon May 23 20:02:18 +0000 2016,It's tiebreaker for 1st set w Hardebeck v Colton #4. Looks like Vandy will force 3rd on Crt 6, so Hardbeck would protect lower crts for Card
734834504355848200,Mon May 23 19:52:53 +0000 2016,Hardebeck was down one break at 4-5 &amp; has climbed back to go up one break 6-5. This is how she has collected among the most wins on the team
734833018221649900,Mon May 23 19:46:58 +0000 2016,Of course Lampl would convert set point w a FH out of the air winner. It's her specialty. When do we start calling it "the Lampl"?
734832079083425800,Mon May 23 19:43:14 +0000 2016,It got a little shaky for Lord on Crt 6 w string of missed groundstrokes, but she clinches 1st set 6-4. Imp to keep Stanford one step ahead
734831540870336500,Mon May 23 19:41:06 +0000 2016,Hardebeck is broken to go down 4-5 Crt 4. That could hurt, but if anyone can come back, it would be her

734113978440290300,Sat May 21 20:09:46 +0000 2016,Yes, she had some shaky moments today. But she won at No. 3 &amp; Stanford off to Final Four. Played top-tier tennis when it counted most (2/2)
734113751683633200,Sat May 21 20:08:52 +0000 2016,Doyle converted w a well-played match point. She dictated w heavy, aggressive FHs and stepped forward. (1/2)
734113152959275000,Sat May 21 20:06:29 +0000 2016,@joeydillon As we see w another double fault just now...
734113017990807600,Sat May 21 20:05:57 +0000 2016,@joeydillon I wouldn't be flippant, but I would say the pressure-filled moments consistently weigh most heavily on her as she tries to serve
734112579258179600,Sat May 21 20:04:12 +0000 2016,3 missed serves in a row and then FH wide from Doyle. Two points away from sending Stanford to Final Four...
734112039275110400,Sat May 21 20:02:03 +0000 2016,Doyle's ability to hit high, heavy over net throughout rallies is really helpful in these crazy pressure-filled moments, helps avoid errors
734111541847416800,Sat May 21 20:00:05 +0000 2016,Fahey just dumped a FH into mid-net on a short lob Doyle threw up while on defensive. Doyle up 3-0, all the pressure is on
734111153266122800,Sat May 21 19:58:32 +0000 2016,Doyle saves it. Tiebreaker now to decide whole dual match
734111005043654700,Sat May 21 19:57:57 +0000 2016,Two unforced errors from Doyle and match pt for Fahey at 40-40
734110180091142100,Sat May 21 19:54:40 +0000 2016,wowwwwww. Doyle flicks BH slice on the run short cross court for winner. 30-0
734109906710597600,Sat May 21 19:53:35 +0000 2016,Doyle vs. Fahey on Crt 3 is deciding match. Doyle on serve, down 5-6 and Fahey took momentum in that last game...
734109183121850400,Sat May 21 19:50:43 +0000 2016,@ChrisDiedrich Honestly not sure, I've been watching Doyle... So many matches going on at once! But I'm surprised as well
734108802585231400,Sat May 21 19:49:12 +0000 2016,BH slice from the baseline as you battle for third set, down 4-5? Why not? Doyle just played a killer game and its 5-5. Stanford needs this.
734108382865416200,Sat May 21 19:47:32 +0000 2016,If Fahey gets into groove hitting heavy and deep corners, Doyle scrambles impressively but usually won't be enough.
734107000687104000,Sat May 21 19:42:02 +0000 2016,Doyle hits crazy FHDTL winner on the run, converts on next deciding point to hold for 4-4 and break 4-game losing streak. YES. #GoStanford
734106368907436000,Sat May 21 19:39:32 +0000 2016,Doyle has lost 4 games in a row. Michigan's Fahey holds at love &amp; up 4-3 in third set. It's now or never...
734104242038808600,Sat May 21 19:31:04 +0000 2016,@AlexaCorse Fun fact: Frosh Lampl is 8-4 in three-setters THIS season. 12 is a lot... Next closest # of 3-setters is Lord @ 3-5 for season.
734103333015674900,Sat May 21 19:27:28 +0000 2016,Stanford needs to win in 2 of 3 three-setters. Doyle, Davidson &amp; Lampl have all won more 3-setters than lost this yr https://t.co/mRYnfvxrt3
734102196313198600,Sat May 21 19:22:57 +0000 2016,Davidson just took killer BH out of the air winner. You wish you were watching the livestream @StanfordWTennis #GoStanford
734101813805252600,Sat May 21 19:21:26 +0000 2016,Davidson is broken at 0-40, now she's back in a hole down 4-5 in 2nd. Minor took control in the last few pts. May split sets here on Crt 4?
734101010025611300,Sat May 21 19:18:14 +0000 2016,Davidson saves herself in 2nd set by breaking back (40-15) for 4-4. #GoStanford
734099936598315000,Sat May 21 19:13:58 +0000 2016,Davidson sends BH into bottom of net: had (at least) 2 pts to hold but ended up getting broken at 40-40 and now 3-4 second set.
734098691024261100,Sat May 21 19:09:01 +0000 2016,This is tighttttt. @StanfordWTennis doing much, much better than what could have played out after disappointing dubs https://t.co/ug2J1iVa55
734098362161471500,Sat May 21 19:07:43 +0000 2016,@ChrisDiedrich She's a true competitor. Very glad she's been on Stanford's side these last four yrs!!
734095972783915000,Sat May 21 18:58:13 +0000 2016,Hardebeck defends FOUR break pts, holds at 40-40 for 6-5!! I've been watching her kill it in the most pressure-filled moments all season...
734095313317691400,Sat May 21 18:55:36 +0000 2016,Hardbeck converts on 3rd break pt, back on serve at 5-5 second set. There's a reason she's won 19 of last 21--no giving up @StanfordWTennis
734094125004247000,Sat May 21 18:50:52 +0000 2016,Hardebeck just broken, 4-5. Hit short second serve at 40-40, Michigan's Najarian pounced for FH inside-out winner https://t.co/L6vtz0ELIV
734092170949337100,Sat May 21 18:43:06 +0000 2016,Doyle had chance at 40-40 to break Michigan's Fahey, but FH went wide. Doyle down 0-3 in 2nd after 6-2 1st. Can Doyle reclaim momentum?
734090761629622300,Sat May 21 18:37:30 +0000 2016,Davidson just held at 40-40, 4-4 w big first serve &amp; Michigan's Minor pushed return long. Davidson has struggled w 2x faults, so imp point.
734090286708592600,Sat May 21 18:35:37 +0000 2016,Lampl does it 6-4! 4 first sets for Stanford is a very impressive showing.  https://t.co/XSTepoy6tm
