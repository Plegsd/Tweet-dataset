25830191191,Tue Sep 28 23:22:58 +0000 2010,@davemcclure no thanks -- I will always pay market price for the best companies, and nothing for all others. You collude away :)
25810790435,Tue Sep 28 18:56:02 +0000 2010,@davemcclure aiming high is always better than preemptively capitulating, which is what you are advocating.
25750276393,Tue Sep 28 03:08:15 +0000 2010,All this #angelgate stuff got me thinking about.. angels. Maybe we are doing it wrong. http://bit.ly/91LlGj
25381721139,Fri Sep 24 06:38:24 +0000 2010,I live under a rock -- just found out about #angelgate. Uncool. But how come I wasn't even invited me to the secret meetings?!! :-)
24709773542,Fri Sep 17 00:06:04 +0000 2010,new twitter is neat, if a little overwhelming. something about it feels a lot like tweetdeck.
22336518888,Sat Aug 28 07:37:49 +0000 2010,Anyone wants to clue me in -- how do I watch Vuelta (in San Francisco)?
22171108379,Thu Aug 26 11:54:37 +0000 2010,I, for one, welcome the return of our fog and cold overlords! The warm SF weather was starting to get out of hand.
21999330104,Tue Aug 24 13:10:18 +0000 2010,You know you are up early when a headline mentioning China Unicom makes you wonder if they have unicorns in China...
21400133820,Tue Aug 17 12:44:44 +0000 2010,Top keyboard row on RIM Torch is 2-3mm too close to the bottom edge of the sliding screen piece (when opened). Bummer, no Torch for me.

20487067609,Fri Aug 06 17:47:56 +0000 2010,Thank you, amazing people of Slide for the wild, amazing journey. You are the reason for this success. Super proud of you all!
20115257551,Mon Aug 02 04:52:53 +0000 2010,The horror: I've watched every single Tour de France DVD box set ('99-'09) I own. What am I supposed to watch while on the trainer now?!
19909303349,Fri Jul 30 13:24:41 +0000 2010,Bought StarCraft II, strictly to honor the myth of the second coming of the perfect game. Doubt I am going to play it though :)
19719303403,Wed Jul 28 06:07:59 +0000 2010,Front page of cnn.com features "Cats that look like Hitler". Just not enough other important stuff happening in the world, I guess.
19467505166,Sun Jul 25 03:33:05 +0000 2010,Number of business conversations disrupted by AT&T's crap service in SF has just gone one over tolerable. Goodbye, iPhone.
19337925738,Fri Jul 23 13:11:57 +0000 2010,Though frequently suspected of being a cyborg, I do have feelings. For example: very envious of all who went to France to see the Tour live.
19279277449,Thu Jul 22 19:48:12 +0000 2010,Stomach still makes noises that make one believe in ancient curses, but much better today. Peak to trough weight fluctuation:  10 lbs!
19072803933,Wed Jul 21 12:33:51 +0000 2010,Nothing quite spices up the night like an ultra-nasty stomach bug. Thanks, Seattle! Was it something I said (about Starbucks)?

18940871750,Mon Jul 19 20:12:15 +0000 2010,@andytriboletti I have zero quarrel with Starbucks actually, but I do not like their preparation of my drink of choice, is all :)
18940490868,Mon Jul 19 20:04:53 +0000 2010,Coffee-quest part two: enjoying a cup from the still-independent Tully's and prepping for my meeting on their free WiFi.
18935730202,Mon Jul 19 18:35:22 +0000 2010,Roamed this mega-mall for 30 mins to avoid buying Starbucks, got a cup of Seattle Best.. and recall SB owns them too. Rebellion fail.

17951763226,Wed Jul 07 14:15:25 +0000 2010,Good to have some reliable, constant things in life. Like Phil Liggett saying "leaky gas" for 10+ years...
17950882137,Wed Jul 07 14:03:04 +0000 2010,"We'll distribute great local deals to our audience" is the business model meme of the year.
17261211512,Mon Jun 28 15:59:52 +0000 2010,@joshk mmm not quite -- just board member replacement is more arbitrary now. It is the first step though!
17164669226,Sun Jun 27 13:41:51 +0000 2010,@gbboy cycling appears to be the perfect antidote to burnout for me. since I can't tweet about work much, I tweet about cycling :)
17161330255,Sun Jun 27 12:37:57 +0000 2010,Nothing helps one sleep through a redeye flight like a 100mi bike ride earlier the same day. Slept like a baby. Now in JFK.
17123477224,Sat Jun 26 23:06:04 +0000 2010,Did Giro De Peninsula Century ride. Very down-home (no organized start time, etc) but still awesome. Tunitas Creek climb is awesome.
16720489992,Mon Jun 21 20:47:17 +0000 2010,@Coral_BestBuy Geary St in San Francisco. Employees meant well, but lethargically failed to find the right laptop in a box for ~0.5h
16709766987,Mon Jun 21 17:40:41 +0000 2010,Why does twitter.com not show a counter next to @mlevchin when I get new mentions? If you are going to pre-sort my messages...
16707898864,Mon Jun 21 17:10:21 +0000 2010,@SuthaKamal still testing. rode a storck yesterday. insane.
16707852441,Mon Jun 21 17:09:37 +0000 2010,@chgriffin I am in no position in organizing much of anything beyond my own work/cycling/baby :) but I'll join if it happens :)
16699769516,Mon Jun 21 15:03:58 +0000 2010,With no major pro cycling events to watch in the mornings I have a choice between world cup and cycling porn (Tour de France highlights)
16670488262,Mon Jun 21 05:00:49 +0000 2010,@mfolgs a Dell -- decent support, and available retail at Best Buy.
16662734803,Mon Jun 21 02:42:47 +0000 2010,@mfolgs a $550 Dell. Can't actually remember the model name anymore :-) Pretty powerful device for the price, and 4G of RAM...
16648877945,Sun Jun 20 22:27:31 +0000 2010,@JMikeSmith had specific instructions as to the OS for the computer :)
16639167549,Sun Jun 20 19:33:25 +0000 2010,time to pick out a cheap laptop for mom-in-law at @bestbuy: 3 min. time it took incompetent employees to check me out: 20.. and counting.
16634640022,Sun Jun 20 18:10:03 +0000 2010,@BrianNorgard Both that and the opposite is true: over-design for the sake of appearing original or inventive is just as rampant a sin.
16634498980,Sun Jun 20 18:07:29 +0000 2010,@jess Thanks! Seems to skew more Design than Product. Perhaps a new term is needed -- people who deeply care about the user, not product.
16634209678,Sun Jun 20 18:02:20 +0000 2010,Is there a school that offers Product Design as a major? An online course? Anything to correct the current sad state... (yes, ranting)
16618605694,Sun Jun 20 14:03:53 +0000 2010,Enjoying live reporting from final stage of Tour De Suisse by @procyclinglive. As someone said earlier, twittter is radio.
16569813640,Sat Jun 19 20:30:44 +0000 2010,Excellent ride today with @purplepatchfit, legs were good. The GI surprise I picked up on last trip to China was not.
16529011679,Sat Jun 19 07:02:35 +0000 2010,Product people: you are NOT designing (consumer stuff) for smart and elitist you, but for average, impatient, vain, distracted you.
16527629120,Sat Jun 19 06:28:33 +0000 2010,Alpine Dam ride tomorrow. Will be fun either way, but hoping for good legs!
16433525265,Fri Jun 18 01:58:05 +0000 2010,@RodBegbie re: lovemachine -- would you like to?

16433235821,Fri Jun 18 01:53:48 +0000 2010,Surely there is opportunity in Twitter echo service with 100% uptime. Then, Twitter can acquire it and have 100% uptime of its own!
15765159371,Wed Jun 09 07:11:25 +0000 2010,I love interviewing people visibly and genuinely excited about joining Slide, nothing quite like it.
15765022949,Wed Jun 09 07:07:42 +0000 2010,Proud owner of cool Transitions glasses (yes, just like a certain sprinter). Unfortunately, the world now looks as seen through a fishbowl.

14336032613,Thu May 20 03:11:34 +0000 2010,Having two major cycling races going on at the same (Tour of CA and Giro) reduced my productivty yesterday, but will prevailed today.
14182583266,Mon May 17 20:48:44 +0000 2010,@rabois does it say something that I am only doing it on a day when my brain is positively fried?
14181513233,Mon May 17 20:25:11 +0000 2010,#notetoself Getting up in NY at 4am just to be in SF at 10 is not at all worth the clouded brain for the rest of the day.
14181448178,Mon May 17 20:23:44 +0000 2010,@purplepatchfit congratulations! :)
14174795596,Mon May 17 17:51:59 +0000 2010,Arrived 10' early in SFO on VA... to hear that all VA luggage is 15' delayed. Thankfully, Twitter is here to help me complain about it.

13594522890,Sat May 08 06:28:10 +0000 2010,@codias they are doing it today on every (modern) mobile device. One small question is how many can they retain.
13578014681,Sat May 08 00:18:30 +0000 2010,Number of distinct icons passive memory can retain is a critcal stat for mobile web. Wonder what cogsci research exists on this.
12649636350,Thu Apr 22 16:55:00 +0000 2010,Mistakenly took wife's iPod to AM's run. Terrfied that our "power songs" overlap this much. Except for Coldplay. Anything but that! :)
11843147537,Thu Apr 08 21:00:49 +0000 2010,Most Americans are arguing about how to spend other people's money.  Simply illustrated politics of taxes: http://bit.ly/9WVdsW

11353375476,Wed Mar 31 06:24:35 +0000 2010,@JKMAXS i never pre-announce investments :)
11230428431,Mon Mar 29 03:45:59 +0000 2010,@gbboy heh, probably not -- I don't invest in projects more than a few hundred miles away from home.
11221556213,Mon Mar 29 00:41:19 +0000 2010,@andytriboletti  I suspect it's just everyone trying to get their seed money in before they have to register with the SEC :-P
11221461169,Mon Mar 29 00:39:09 +0000 2010,@gbboy example -- 7 over-subscribed seed-round startups wanted to pitch me in the last 4 days.
11178179701,Sun Mar 28 04:04:26 +0000 2010,I haven't seen this level of startup activity (and angel investing) in SV since '98. Where's Sen. Dodd to halt this irrational exuberance?!
10890759474,Mon Mar 22 21:06:07 +0000 2010,Yes, I agree with @sanjay and others, delayed outrage.  Going back to raging about the health care bill.
10890714412,Mon Mar 22 21:04:14 +0000 2010,@varenc Loss of social capital and credibility.  Random unfamiliar people show up in friends' stream when I RT, and I get minimal credit.
10888116148,Mon Mar 22 19:58:34 +0000 2010,First time back on twitter.com (from TweetDeck) in months.  Really dislike the retweet change.
9314247748,Fri Feb 19 02:21:28 +0000 2010,@nlevchin (aka mrs @mlevchin) gave birth to baby boy Benjamin at 11:0am today.   Appropriately, the labor was an all-nighter :)
8912791133,Wed Feb 10 18:27:52 +0000 2010,Buzz's onboarding process fails me in the same way twitter's does.  So who should I follow?!  Is there anyone  interesting out there?
8482448750,Mon Feb 01 03:39:29 +0000 2010,Disemarked flight LH458 into the hands of a dozen US Marshals. They weren't waiting for me -- anybody know whom they were waiting for?
8288720807,Wed Jan 27 18:29:07 +0000 2010,I must be one of the few who found Sarkozy's Davos speech anti-market. "excessive profits"?!! And who defines "excessive"?
6945370842,Tue Dec 22 23:21:52 +0000 2009,Suddenly discovered Girl Talk nearly a year after @ndjbaker introduced me to it (doh!)  Extremely inventive mashups.
5881493746,Fri Nov 20 05:35:06 +0000 2009,Obligatory once in a while live concert tweet: Royksopp absolutely killing it at SF show.  Live show as great as the albums.

3492969433,Sun Aug 23 15:19:13 +0000 2009,Upon further reflection, District-9 is "Roadside Picnic" meets "Enemy Mine" with a touch of Kafka for good measure.
3488633930,Sun Aug 23 07:58:43 +0000 2009,Saw D-9. Wonder if authors aware of "The Roadside Picnic" (A&B Strugatsky). Film was good, though stylistically wavered a bit.
3449295225,Fri Aug 21 13:12:34 +0000 2009,Watched new-ish Brit comedy "In The Loop" -- brilliant political satire, great script and cast. Scottish accents as weapons.  #ineversleep

3193876308,Sat Aug 08 15:17:24 +0000 2009,Jardin Des Tuileries. Week of pedaling has caught up to me finally -- feeling wiped.  Can't wait to get back to work, miss the Sliders.
3191322911,Sat Aug 08 09:22:20 +0000 2009,In Orly, the other Paris airport. Traveling with bike boxes is a pain.  3:1 ratio of in-airport : flying time.

2952851663,Fri Jul 31 15:30:32 +0000 2009,And now in Toulouse.  Hopefully the TdF spirit is still in the air, or on the roads.

2919715232,Thu Jul 30 00:00:18 +0000 2009,I take the plunge, my riding style must change.  Goodbye 15-minute standing climbs in the big ring, hello compact crank and pedal-dancing.
2861129687,Mon Jul 27 00:12:45 +0000 2009,Placebo effect: yesterday, felt weak on alpine dam, whined and blamed my new compact crank.  Today discovered I have a 53-39 on this bike :)

2071123805,Mon Jun 08 01:52:29 +0000 2009,Virgin America JFK-&gt;SFO business class $900.  Wifi on board: $12.00.  Whining publicly about a bumpy flight in real time: priceless.
2068315378,Sun Jun 07 20:52:26 +0000 2009,Delayed in JFK.  Interesting how traveling with the sun messes with me subtly. Want breakfast -and- lunch at the same time!
2062995566,Sun Jun 07 08:00:21 +0000 2009,Munich airport, 9am. 15 or so people at AirBrau restaurant, drinking 1 litre glasses of beer.  Naturlich.
2062713138,Sun Jun 07 07:03:51 +0000 2009,Leaving Munich.  Fun trip to see a friend get married.  Staring an 18hr trip back to SF, hung over from many all-German toasts.

2055493271,Sat Jun 06 16:25:04 +0000 2009,@arulnick I am pretty much all about the internets ;-)
2050649689,Sat Jun 06 02:03:03 +0000 2009,Can't believe Rajeev Motwani is dead.  He always seemed to be in state of such grace.  Very very sad.
1938239788,Wed May 27 18:08:25 +0000 2009,If Carol Bartz were in a sitcom, they'd reshoot her scenes a lot. She looooves looking into the camera & at the audience.  And smirking.
1938175695,Wed May 27 18:02:06 +0000 2009,Carol Bartz: Yahoo! Finance chat is "weird".  What else is weird at Y? -- "me".
1938080754,Wed May 27 17:52:26 +0000 2009,Anyone know the Meeting Room password? :-) #D7
1931085562,Wed May 27 02:18:31 +0000 2009,It would have been more recursive if @biz and @ev were interviewed on twitter itself and answered in 140 characters. #allthingsd
1920532965,Tue May 26 05:00:36 +0000 2009,Great ride with @nlevchin -- MV/4 corners/panoramic/stinson/pt reyes/bakery :)/park/whites/camino alto.  60-something miles of awesome.
1760736340,Mon May 11 05:25:51 +0000 2009,@rmalik for a few cycling events and maybe a triathlon or two (still don't love the swim bit).  but mostly just trying to stay in shape :)
1760706696,Mon May 11 05:20:10 +0000 2009,The dark (or rather red) side of cycling in great weather for 5 hours: missed a spot, now have triangular patch of cooked lobster skin.
1756537765,Sun May 10 18:59:48 +0000 2009,85+ miles on the bike yesterday, MV to Nicasio to Petaluma and back - amazing.  Eating protein, recovering, working, and reading today.
1756511574,Sun May 10 18:55:13 +0000 2009,@juleznet happy mothers day!
1663445827,Thu Apr 30 22:18:25 +0000 2009,Perhaps #swineflu is orders of magnitude under-tracked in MX ==&gt; much lower mortality rate than feared.  Has this been proposed already?
1621723773,Sun Apr 26 17:23:04 +0000 2009,An absolutely epic Auburn ride yesterday with @nlevchin and the Purple Patch gang.   First 5mi -- 18% grade.  Note to self -- fuel more.
1601964898,Fri Apr 24 07:37:15 +0000 2009,Does it count as proper rickroll if I tweet "never gonna give you up., never gonna let you down..."?
1545595367,Fri Apr 17 21:06:07 +0000 2009,I am always sweating in Manhattan.  Over-bundled in winter, sun-drilled in summer, running late somewhere, on foot, in cabs.
1514762643,Tue Apr 14 05:24:26 +0000 2009,Playing the Twitter speed-typing game at http://fast140.com - How fast can you type?
1506735207,Mon Apr 13 02:40:16 +0000 2009,@BRoodman not in the world of social apps -- too volatile.
1506617404,Mon Apr 13 02:18:00 +0000 2009,Don't like holidays.  They throw off traffic patterns, which gives me heartburn.
