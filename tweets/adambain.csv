796474377202081800,Wed Nov 09 22:07:43 +0000 2016,I’m excited to take w me everything I’ve experienced at Twitter &amp; do something totally different and new outside the company. Stay tuned!
796474281144111100,Wed Nov 09 22:07:21 +0000 2016,I look at what we’ve built together and how far we’ve come, and I feel like I can leave the company now in a place of strength.
