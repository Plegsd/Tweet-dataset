804208137355956200,Thu Dec 01 06:18:56 +0000 2016,@cramforce true, and I suspect it‚Äôs the boiling frog thing: Ads slowly crept into TV/newspapers over the years without buyers noticing.
804207160594812900,Thu Dec 01 06:15:03 +0000 2016,@cramforce so in summary, I think it‚Äôs never OK to show ads to paid subscribers. This includes cable TV, newspapers, software (e.g. TripIt).

778342973863891000,Tue Sep 20 21:20:00 +0000 2016,@peterc instead, we get startups trying to create dumbed down productivity apps for mobile that simply don‚Äôt fit the former factor.
778342762357719000,Tue Sep 20 21:19:10 +0000 2016,@peterc notable counter examples include Slack, but I see a distinct lack of innovation in productivity apps on Desktop for a while now.
778342564927643600,Tue Sep 20 21:18:23 +0000 2016,@peterc I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôve seen dozens of companies and startups go mobile only, overcorrecting and dismissing Desktop.
778338755895636000,Tue Sep 20 21:03:14 +0000 2016,@bradleysepos excellent, thanks!
778337453195169800,Tue Sep 20 20:58:04 +0000 2016,I‚Äôm starting to wonder how deeply the near complete abandonment of Desktop as platform for productivity apps &amp; sites is affecting the GDP.

777725808836120600,Mon Sep 19 04:27:36 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans @slightlylate couldn‚Äôt disagree more. Desktop is highly important (and growing) in lots of categories.

689156038872858600,Mon Jan 18 18:42:58 +0000 2016,@_Nuriya_ danke, richte ich aus :)
689155954823147500,Mon Jan 18 18:42:38 +0000 2016,@_Nuriya_ das ist auf jeden Fall ein gutes Upgrade! Dann noch SSD Platte (falls du noch nicht hast), das macht den gr√∂√üten Unterschied.

689152455456600000,Mon Jan 18 18:28:43 +0000 2016,@_Nuriya_ hahaha ich h√§tte gerne noch ein paar platziert!

570742890088898560,Thu Feb 26 00:31:23 +0000 2015,@pornelski well, yes :) I can deal with that. Matter of preference I guess.
570742471321370600,Thu Feb 26 00:29:43 +0000 2015,@pornelski Microsoft isn't at all  putting them all into a basket. In fact, all input methods have different UX.
570742192106565600,Thu Feb 26 00:28:37 +0000 2015,@pornelski ;) well that is true.
570742087961829400,Thu Feb 26 00:28:12 +0000 2015,@pornelski I'll try to come up with a few great examples.
570741640735928300,Thu Feb 26 00:26:25 +0000 2015,@pornelski oh agreed. PE doesn't tell you to treat input methods in the same way. Your choice.
570741350863384600,Thu Feb 26 00:25:16 +0000 2015,@pornelski interesting case, haven't looked into it too much. Will look into it.
570741040585568260,Thu Feb 26 00:24:02 +0000 2015,@pornelski you can never go entirely future proof, sure. But can we not at least try and hope for the best? This way we have a chance.
570740753451880450,Thu Feb 26 00:22:54 +0000 2015,@pornelski maybe. Could be.
570740549390442500,Thu Feb 26 00:22:05 +0000 2015,@pornelski oh it will. Dramatically so. That's the Whole Point of it, actually - to be future proof.
570740368032927740,Thu Feb 26 00:21:22 +0000 2015,@pornelski it could. It's just incredibly limiting to think we'll stop at two ways of handling input. Sorry man, die Hard believer in PE.

570738648221671400,Thu Feb 26 00:14:32 +0000 2015,@pornelski it does, but there is no way to feed pressure sensitivity to touch/mouse events. It's a crippled pen at that point :/
