990680423595479000,Sun Apr 29 19:53:13 +0000 2018,Cavs survive. Needed multiple epic  LeBron games. What a fight from the Pacers. An exhausting, intense series.
990676530203373600,Sun Apr 29 19:37:45 +0000 2018,Gotta be a breeze in that left corner. Some horrific misses from there all game.
990672491378085900,Sun Apr 29 19:21:42 +0000 2018,Absolutely monster 3-point shooting from Love this quarter

990656661730754600,Sun Apr 29 18:18:48 +0000 2018,Kevin Love losing the ability to make any shot inside the 3-point arc has been a weird thing
990655345298149400,Sun Apr 29 18:13:34 +0000 2018,That Bron rotation to Bogdanovic in the corner kind of frightened me. A true leave-it-all-on-the-floor half from Bron.
990654084595241000,Sun Apr 29 18:08:33 +0000 2018,That LeBron hasn't been doing this in the post all series has been one of the weirdest ongoing subplots.
