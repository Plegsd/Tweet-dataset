674663741938524200,Wed Dec 09 18:55:45 +0000 2015,Dear Hollywood, by far the most important aspect of any adaptation is capturing the spirit of the source material.Don't copy it, capture it.
674663489273630700,Wed Dec 09 18:54:45 +0000 2015,Dear hardcore fans, whenever there's a movie adaptation, there needs to be changes made to help the story fit the medium. Be open-minded.

665256927702597600,Fri Nov 13 19:56:26 +0000 2015,Dear Hollywood, the secret ingredient to any adaptation is love/passion for the source material. When that's missing, you miss the mark.
