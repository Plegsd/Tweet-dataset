798917681676054500,Wed Nov 16 15:56:33 +0000 2016,@AlecDSilva or, maybe they buy it because it‚Äôs cool and I makes them happy? I hardly think an art book is ‚Äústupid‚Äù
798917481658097700,Wed Nov 16 15:55:45 +0000 2016,@SnazzyQ exactly. I almost bought the complete works of DaVinci for $170 the other day. That‚Äôs a normal price range.

720295174983721000,Wed Apr 13 16:58:46 +0000 2016,@bkmvincent @Adamski @hryvis FCPX can bring footage in the exact same way, you just have to check ‚Äúkeep media in location‚Äù
720294996939640800,Wed Apr 13 16:58:04 +0000 2016,@bkmvincent @Adamski @hryvis Um. You‚Äôre not using ‚Äúimporting‚Äù right. Adobe is talking about  transfer from the card to your computer
720294625588617200,Wed Apr 13 16:56:35 +0000 2016,@Adamski @bkmvincent Right now your media needs to exist in its final location to edit it without relinking.
720294080094187500,Wed Apr 13 16:54:25 +0000 2016,@bkmvincent Right. While your master footage is ingesting. Which is new (for Premiere). And cool.
720292698096164900,Wed Apr 13 16:48:56 +0000 2016,@bkmvincent Watch the Adobe video and it‚Äôll explain it better.
720292119370268700,Wed Apr 13 16:46:38 +0000 2016,@bkmvincent That‚Äôs not what it is. It‚Äôs not transcoding, its editing as the media is being transferred.
720291501905870800,Wed Apr 13 16:44:11 +0000 2016,@bkmvincent Um. No it hasn‚Äôt. Read the link.
720289714087931900,Wed Apr 13 16:37:04 +0000 2016,@Adamski Haha. Yeah, its crazy that they are just now adding that.
720287615727964200,Wed Apr 13 16:28:44 +0000 2016,New Premiere Pro update will have one of my favorite FCPX features: Editing immediately during footage ingest https://t.co/dKCWyrIaWN

642896878506381300,Sun Sep 13 03:05:34 +0000 2015,@Wicked4u2c the screen size isn't the point. Jobs was specifically referencing interfaces that ONLY work with a stylus and not multitouch.
642874726939951100,Sun Sep 13 01:37:33 +0000 2015,People who keep bringing up the Jobs/ stylus thing need to learn context. He said a stylus w/out a touch interface was bad on a phone.

600768990433022000,Tue May 19 21:04:23 +0000 2015,@OT_4_Tech I would think about the Canon 17-40 or 16-35. That way you wouldn't have to go to crop mode.
600767683982856200,Tue May 19 20:59:12 +0000 2015,@OT_4_Tech my short answer is no. It's a great lens on cropped cameras, but not worth it to sacrifice full frame.

562793382461059100,Wed Feb 04 02:02:53 +0000 2015,@heymarkl Layers connect off the main storyline, then you use metadata to manage it. It's a better system, IMO. http://t.co/b0nTVQVvTf
562791136981712900,Wed Feb 04 01:53:57 +0000 2015,@heymarkl Kind off. FCPX uses a different paradigm. Nothing is locked into a track, so you can't say "A1 is all dialog, A2 is MX, etc"
562790291670052860,Wed Feb 04 01:50:36 +0000 2015,@heymarkl Yeah, of course it does that. You can have hundreds of layers above and below the main timeline.

534380598580633600,Mon Nov 17 16:20:37 +0000 2014,@dugdale I'm with you. The price makes it really tempting to just buy one to try.
534379318596468740,Mon Nov 17 16:15:32 +0000 2014,@dugdale It almost seems too perfect. I wonder how how much front lens weight it can take.

533710208338386940,Sat Nov 15 19:56:44 +0000 2014,@austinnotduncan On the flip side, in 1080 the APS-C image is a little sharper since it only uses the center of a FF lens.
533709794444447740,Sat Nov 15 19:55:05 +0000 2014,@austinnotduncan If you shoot in 4K, yes. The image from the sensor in APS-C is actually 2.7K, no problem for HD but gets scaled for UHD.
533697906742550500,Sat Nov 15 19:07:51 +0000 2014,The ability to switch between full frame and aps-c on the #a7S is interesting. Essentially doubles your lens collection.

527562788525199360,Wed Oct 29 20:49:05 +0000 2014,@thesavage042 I turn it off and don't tell people, then they say how great a movie looks. Words like "smooth" make people biased towards it.

526886227316715500,Tue Oct 28 00:00:40 +0000 2014,Shoutout to @superscientific for breaking 100k subscribers. Well deserved.
526794368771186700,Mon Oct 27 17:55:39 +0000 2014,Sony announced the specs on their 4k ready QXD cards. The FS7 seems perfect until you see how much a 64gb card is http://t.co/E44LkN6u6s
526775474211393540,Mon Oct 27 16:40:34 +0000 2014,@mkbhd Saw this yesterday. This is some real next level stuff.
526509913166454800,Sun Oct 26 23:05:20 +0000 2014,@techtechreviews I love it. I'm still trying to decide on lenses though. Tempted to buy some Sony FE glass.

526077131525074940,Sat Oct 25 18:25:36 +0000 2014,@tldtoday Especially since Apple can use the "duplicating function" App Store rejection &amp; keep CurrentC off iPhones, making it DOA.

525717783389032450,Fri Oct 24 18:37:41 +0000 2014,It seems like Multi Channel Networks have exploded lately. I get at least two emails a day to join "exciting and unique" networks.

524760015396040700,Wed Oct 22 03:11:51 +0000 2014,@OT_4_Tech My short answer is yes. Not because it's a better all around camera, but because it's a better camera for me.
524758872188153860,Wed Oct 22 03:07:19 +0000 2014,@techlover86 So far I think so. I haven't done a full test yet, though.
524758081779941400,Wed Oct 22 03:04:10 +0000 2014,Remote monitoring and control on my iPhone. Yet another reason I'm digging the A7s http://t.co/UNI6IxLc8B

524732099886985200,Wed Oct 22 01:20:56 +0000 2014,@jackmayofilms Definitely. I wouldn't knock anyone who weighed all the options and decided on one.
524728928498245600,Wed Oct 22 01:08:20 +0000 2014,@jackmayofilms Maybe. I can get a speedbooster adapter and an EVF though and still come in cheaper.
524725064877367300,Wed Oct 22 00:52:59 +0000 2014,I can think of no compelling reason to get a C100 MkII over a GH4 with YAGH base.

524030117895340000,Mon Oct 20 02:51:30 +0000 2014,@snazzyq It's cool if you're a computer history geek. It's about the early 80's PC revolution.
524028301753339900,Mon Oct 20 02:44:17 +0000 2014,@snazzyq Mad Men? Hell on Wheels? Halt and Catch Fire? Until recently, Breaking Bad? AMC is easily the most acclaimed network after HBO.

523661584313237500,Sun Oct 19 02:27:05 +0000 2014,@marcomhanna @superscientific @tomas_villegas Yeah, the Sony cards aren't cheap either. That's the biggest downside for me.
523658650405990400,Sun Oct 19 02:15:26 +0000 2014,@superscientific @tomas_villegas  That's cheap when you consider it out-specs the $16K Canon C500.

523647579763261440,Sun Oct 19 01:31:26 +0000 2014,@superscientific @tldtoday probably a good call. Several cameras right now are *almost* perfect.
523647017055420400,Sun Oct 19 01:29:12 +0000 2014,@WaveMedia I wasn't thinking about it, but I could. I'll add it to the list.
523646761689419800,Sun Oct 19 01:28:11 +0000 2014,@davidsdiego on the iPad I like Pinnacle. On the iPhone it's a mix depending on what I'm doing. Gravie has some cool features.
523638433118318600,Sun Oct 19 00:55:05 +0000 2014,@theapplefreak I think so.
523638369641713660,Sun Oct 19 00:54:50 +0000 2014,@tldtoday Yeah. Plus I don't really need the monitor. I'm hoping someone makes a plain recorder like the BM Shuttle or Atoms Ninja Star
523637098553692160,Sun Oct 19 00:49:47 +0000 2014,@tldtoday No, I'm going to hold off for a couple months and pick one up used. People flip that sort of thing a lot.
523636485585510400,Sun Oct 19 00:47:21 +0000 2014,Finally have the behind-the-scenes of my iPhone 6 video demo uploaded. https://t.co/i5wNUjDN2w http://t.co/lpiC4iCMDw
523636026523140100,Sun Oct 19 00:45:32 +0000 2014,@wavemedia @tldtoday The GH4 is great, but not for me. I need low light for events, full frame for stills, and high DR for narrative.
523634586710839300,Sun Oct 19 00:39:48 +0000 2014,@tldtoday Yeah. I needed a hybrid stills/video since I'm selling all my Canon gear, otherwise I would have gone FS7. I'll upload test soon.
523633104393482240,Sun Oct 19 00:33:55 +0000 2014,@tldtoday yep. Powered EF to E mount.

523516219769360400,Sat Oct 18 16:49:27 +0000 2014,@edryhilario oh I'm with you on that. 4K was made to sell new TVs.
523512447060037600,Sat Oct 18 16:34:28 +0000 2014,@tomas_villegas for sure.
523507081073016800,Sat Oct 18 16:13:09 +0000 2014,@tomas_villegas at $7000 it is slightly out of my price range right now. I'll probably buy a used one in six months.
523505557508853760,Sat Oct 18 16:07:05 +0000 2014,If you are like me and hopeless waiting for the C200, check out Sony's new FS7. 4K. Super 35 sensor. 10 bit 4.2.2. https://t.co/cjwEdIxnRX
523278742827708400,Sat Oct 18 01:05:49 +0000 2014,@heresthebear I like it so far.
523217522993020900,Fri Oct 17 21:02:33 +0000 2014,@dontfollowtech I use the Apple one. Did you put the right spacer on top?
523199306560335900,Fri Oct 17 19:50:09 +0000 2014,@techtechreviews That was one of the big selling points for me. Manageable file size with high end footage. What lenses are you using?
523198400053796860,Fri Oct 17 19:46:33 +0000 2014,@techtechreviews But yeah, if they offered 10bit out to a recorder it would make it a lot more tempting to buy one
523197933479415800,Fri Oct 17 19:44:42 +0000 2014,@techtechreviews I played around with 10bit GH4 cine footage and A7S 8bit slog last week and felt, to my eye, the sLog held up better.
523196477586165760,Fri Oct 17 19:38:55 +0000 2014,@techtechreviews For me the Shogun isn't worth it right now.  In the end,10Bit is just another spec that means nothing in the end result.
523192854769049600,Fri Oct 17 19:24:31 +0000 2014,@jb_tte Yeah, looks great with that wallpaper. Side note, when I was in the Air Force I got to fly in a Canadian F-18. It was awesome

522798395132358660,Thu Oct 16 17:17:05 +0000 2014,The iOS vs Android version install comparison is really a false equivalency. Such a massive difference between device variety.

521063803468144640,Sat Oct 11 22:24:26 +0000 2014,@johnaugust @clmazin At a wedding reception today. "Unchained Melody" plays. Girlfriend leans in. Whispers softly: "Aww Scriptnotes".
520647499690688500,Fri Oct 10 18:50:11 +0000 2014,Anyone using this portable USB charger? Its 73% off right now, so it seems like a good deal http://t.co/1GSjYXx09u
520292835804069900,Thu Oct 09 19:20:53 +0000 2014,@tldtoday @austinnotduncan you'd need some kind of HDMI to Thunderbolt 4k capture setup. Not the cheapest thing. BM makes one for $1K.
520274882857160700,Thu Oct 09 18:09:32 +0000 2014,@edryhilario agree on rolling shutter.
520272933877317600,Thu Oct 09 18:01:48 +0000 2014,@edryhilario specifically I'm talking about filmic quality and DR. Obviously the Alexa destroys it in other areas.
520272223349653500,Thu Oct 09 17:58:58 +0000 2014,@edryhilario used them both and it is absolutely the closest thing for under $15k.
520271810365898750,Thu Oct 09 17:57:20 +0000 2014,@theapplefreak @austinnotduncan the one that most people are interested in is the Atomos Shogun, which is definitely pro level.
520270837174132740,Thu Oct 09 17:53:28 +0000 2014,@oscdelagarza yeah, if you want compact 4K the GH4 is the right call. SLOG2 range is mind blowing on the A7, though. Looks like an Alexa.
520269817018728450,Thu Oct 09 17:49:25 +0000 2014,@oscdelagarza I think the problem is they are all *almost* perfect. You have to pick which limitation bothers you the least.
520269493784698900,Thu Oct 09 17:48:08 +0000 2014,@austinnotduncan not a portable one until November, but you can go into a rack or a laptop now.
520269160186540000,Thu Oct 09 17:46:48 +0000 2014,@oscdelagarza don't need to. I've shot with both myself.
520268218183585800,Thu Oct 09 17:43:03 +0000 2014,Alright. After a lot of thought I think I'm going with the A7s over the GH4 and Blackmagic as my new camera.

519936383129886700,Wed Oct 08 19:44:28 +0000 2014,@nikali1218 Yeah, that's kind of difference in philosophy between the two. FCPX gives more system resources to current edit than background

519512345786085400,Tue Oct 07 15:39:29 +0000 2014,@scarboy6693 it's the closest. I'm actually renting one this week to test it out. No internal 4k is the biggest drawback.
519510030693855200,Tue Oct 07 15:30:18 +0000 2014,Okay. This is what I want in a camera: Full frame. 4K. 13 stops. Usable at 6400 ISO. Pro codec. Under $3999. Someone make that.
519509004834205700,Tue Oct 07 15:26:13 +0000 2014,@tldtoday So the Canon thing is just an ad campaign? I would have been more impressed with a new printer.
519339069474480100,Tue Oct 07 04:10:57 +0000 2014,@MarcoMHanna @tldtoday Right now Canon's 4k camera is $10K and only 11 stops of DR. They will lose everyone without something new soon.

499953562059669500,Thu Aug 14 16:19:52 +0000 2014,@drsyell There are several paid alternative mass messaging systems. No one used them because everyone likes free with ads better.

499950888367046660,Thu Aug 14 16:09:15 +0000 2014,@austinsbasement The only thing that really bothers me about FCPX still is that it can't export OMF.
499950628794163200,Thu Aug 14 16:08:13 +0000 2014,@austinsbasement You are absolutely right about not being able to switch easy from a standard NLE to FCPX. Huge learning curve
499950469549023200,Thu Aug 14 16:07:35 +0000 2014,@austinsbasement It just a preference thing I guess. I like PP for group workflows but FCPX if I'm doing the edit solo.
499949656718069760,Thu Aug 14 16:04:21 +0000 2014,@austinsbasement That's not true. You can created gaps in the timeline using "Position". Shortcut is the P key. Turns off magnetic timeline
499938461638344700,Thu Aug 14 15:19:52 +0000 2014,@austinsbasement All fair points. I actually like the magnetic timeline for daily edits. Lets me string out a rough to show directors
499936782465503200,Thu Aug 14 15:13:11 +0000 2014,@austinsbasement I would say FCPX is the best NLE out there for short form content.
499936655168401400,Thu Aug 14 15:12:41 +0000 2014,@alexeystech Nope, the newer versions work regardless of hardware

465926450189590500,Mon May 12 18:48:16 +0000 2014,@mkbhd For example, look at my 24p HiRise vid http://t.co/r7asVQlxFX vs many of the ones shot at 30p http://t.co/gJOqNQdEvK

465911773137100800,Mon May 12 17:49:57 +0000 2014,@og1gtp High shutter is probably a good call for sports.

465887108024922100,Mon May 12 16:11:56 +0000 2014,@austinnotduncan @mkbhd You need to make sure your shutter is twice your FPS, so you get motion blur instead of stutter. So 24fps=1/48 sec
465885761582018560,Mon May 12 16:06:35 +0000 2014,@mkbhd 24fps for life‚Ä¶ unless the camera only does 23.976

460454431713017860,Sun Apr 27 16:24:26 +0000 2014,More cool stuff on the #GH4 from @MarcoMHanna and @superscientific http://t.co/NlVwixHb2s Love the 4K shot at 5:32
460443853397295100,Sun Apr 27 15:42:23 +0000 2014,The backlash to @comixology removing in-app purchases is pretty severe. I wonder if it will force @amazon to reverse course.
460233515800354800,Sun Apr 27 01:46:35 +0000 2014,@macmike1000 Not right now. My upgraded Pro tower still runs great, so I'm going to hold out for another year or so.
460225971933564900,Sun Apr 27 01:16:36 +0000 2014,Who's going to VidCon? I'm thinking about attending this year.
460173747303895040,Sat Apr 26 21:49:05 +0000 2014,Some practical slo-mo test of the new GH4 at 96fps from @GearAddix http://t.co/c9Dg2rM17y
460147741918629900,Sat Apr 26 20:05:45 +0000 2014,@macmike1000 Got it. I'll check it out.
460147157710798850,Sat Apr 26 20:03:26 +0000 2014,@macmike1000 Cool. Thanks.
460146432301740000,Sat Apr 26 20:00:33 +0000 2014,Anyone using this? http://t.co/QPtEScHoK9 Recommendations for something similar?
460136109834387460,Sat Apr 26 19:19:32 +0000 2014,More fun with #Waterlogue and retro #apple stuff. http://t.co/7W8BCWkHDE
460135065859522560,Sat Apr 26 19:15:23 +0000 2014,@bronpeds Right now I'm a full time student and do cinematography and script consulting on the side. Before that I was in the Air Force.
460130386375213060,Sat Apr 26 18:56:47 +0000 2014,@bronpeds Working. A lot.
459863908396699650,Sat Apr 26 01:17:54 +0000 2014,Awesome 1982 Apple flat screen concept from Esslinger  http://t.co/d5EhNOS5K3
459321325434064900,Thu Apr 24 13:21:52 +0000 2014,@tksEngen yes.
458761092106178560,Wed Apr 23 00:15:42 +0000 2014,@facucario They are from an old Panasonic stereo I had, so no, I'm not sure of the model number or name.
458753015264985100,Tue Apr 22 23:43:36 +0000 2014,New video up featuring the HiRise  from @twelvesouth / @andrewbg http://t.co/r7asVQlxFX
458745611949330400,Tue Apr 22 23:14:11 +0000 2014,@M7Gadget sure
458739095997382660,Tue Apr 22 22:48:18 +0000 2014,@M7Gadget sorry I missed your question. Glad you got it figured out.
458725574031048700,Tue Apr 22 21:54:34 +0000 2014,@dannydaft Yep, so I'm used to latitude issues as well.  I do shoot in cinestyle, which helps.
458724517561372700,Tue Apr 22 21:50:22 +0000 2014,@dannydaft For sure. That's going to probably be fun to grade.
458724307472900100,Tue Apr 22 21:49:32 +0000 2014,@samuelgosss I AM! Thanks for watching.
458722852380749800,Tue Apr 22 21:43:45 +0000 2014,@overexcell Thanks for liking my video!
458722016820871200,Tue Apr 22 21:40:26 +0000 2014,@dannydaft I'm going to have a color grading video up soon. What are you editing with?
458691136710639600,Tue Apr 22 19:37:43 +0000 2014,I'm having a lot of fun with the #Waterlogue app. http://t.co/grvrwVMqj2
458428332216811500,Tue Apr 22 02:13:26 +0000 2014,@jackmayofilms Ha. Let me know how it goes.
458428133092241400,Tue Apr 22 02:12:38 +0000 2014,@jackmayofilms Yeah, I think that would work.
458426748799963140,Tue Apr 22 02:07:08 +0000 2014,@jackmayofilms Haha
458426578523807740,Tue Apr 22 02:06:28 +0000 2014,@khanhnwin That's awesome!
458422295485112300,Tue Apr 22 01:49:26 +0000 2014,For all you #iMovie editors, I have new tutorial up: https://t.co/rWx7F80Abi
458376494113234940,Mon Apr 21 22:47:27 +0000 2014,@misc_candy So awesome.
458340288210010100,Mon Apr 21 20:23:34 +0000 2014,@BlakeWilson8 thanks! I actually just uploaded a video yesterday with more to come soon.
458339836512858100,Mon Apr 21 20:21:47 +0000 2014,@BlakeWilson8 awesome collection.
458337871162658800,Mon Apr 21 20:13:58 +0000 2014,@daviddeblaere haha. I don't think I'm that good.
458305625944887300,Mon Apr 21 18:05:50 +0000 2014,@pabl0sandoval Yep. Although I do have the Apple smart cover to protect it while it's in my bag.
458305369370943500,Mon Apr 21 18:04:49 +0000 2014,@austinnotduncan I missed this video when it first came out. Really awesome. Love the "mini-doc" style.
458295526408986600,Mon Apr 21 17:25:42 +0000 2014,@pabl0sandoval Nope. I do upgrade every year, though. Maybe if I was going to keep it for a few years I'd use more protection.
458277610296848400,Mon Apr 21 16:14:31 +0000 2014,@sjwillw Haha. I enjoy a challenge sometimes.
458277539249549300,Mon Apr 21 16:14:14 +0000 2014,@superscientific @mrthaibox123 Good to know of the file size thing.
458277449202012160,Mon Apr 21 16:13:52 +0000 2014,@mkbhd Thanks man. I was thinking that or the OPPO
458276533740654600,Mon Apr 21 16:10:14 +0000 2014,@btechtalk_  That's what I hear.
458276443319857150,Mon Apr 21 16:09:53 +0000 2014,@mrthaibox123  Thanks. I have seen @superscientific's Oppo video so I was lending toward that.
458275925763686400,Mon Apr 21 16:07:49 +0000 2014,I want to shoot and edit a high quality short film on an Android device.  What  should I use? Looking for clean image and wide aperture.
458051992636502000,Mon Apr 21 01:17:59 +0000 2014,@imustark Thanks!
458035679113392100,Mon Apr 21 00:13:10 +0000 2014,Trying out a new template on the gear blog. http://t.co/TtQTR2UaVA
458008853838192640,Sun Apr 20 22:26:34 +0000 2014,@appleintelli Sure. Packing tips is actually a good idea since I haven't seen many videos on it.
457974730134282240,Sun Apr 20 20:10:59 +0000 2014,@MarcoMHanna definitely.  Luckily I'm not looking to buy until the end of the summer, so I have time to see real hands on with it.
457971287046897660,Sun Apr 20 19:57:18 +0000 2014,@marcomhanna I'm looking forward to seeing some real-world test footage from it.
457969808340836350,Sun Apr 20 19:51:25 +0000 2014,@geekynesshere Haha. Sometimes I wish YouTube let us have a little say in the ad types.
457969697284055040,Sun Apr 20 19:50:59 +0000 2014,@mkbhd @tldtoday I agree on the 4K. Also a decent codec. Shooting straight to ProRes in the BM is a big selling point for me.
457968248814706700,Sun Apr 20 19:45:13 +0000 2014,I see @MKBHD shooting with a RED, @tldtoday with a Blackmagic‚Ä¶ Might be time to step up my camera game.
457720184682209300,Sun Apr 20 03:19:30 +0000 2014,@MarkLinsangan_ thanks dude

457520323034751000,Sat Apr 19 14:05:19 +0000 2014,@CamzSteph sure. I just followed you.
457210727401414660,Fri Apr 18 17:35:06 +0000 2014,@qapps you've probably already been asked this a hundred times, but are there any plans for an iPad version of Weekend Read?
456088036262940700,Tue Apr 15 15:13:56 +0000 2014,@BudgetFilmmaker that's a really great looking rig.
455117870297407500,Sat Apr 12 22:58:50 +0000 2014,@EdJonlara I knew you were kidding. Hopefully I'll have some great new stuff up soon!
455115929244811260,Sat Apr 12 22:51:07 +0000 2014,@EdJonlara haha. To be fair I still get taxed on the old videos too. I'm making a slow return to the online world right now.

455055839250772000,Sat Apr 12 18:52:21 +0000 2014,Being a student/ writer/ filmmaker/ youtuber is awesome...except when it's tax time.
453671092700184600,Tue Apr 08 23:09:51 +0000 2014,This is the culmination of my "@Shannon_Corbeil blows something up" series of student films. http://t.co/MDPD0RKPFg
453268319680749600,Mon Apr 07 20:29:23 +0000 2014,@phonedog_marco @superscientific Agreed. There is something about the 35mm size that I just like better (plus the technical advantages)
