272725839492300800,Sun Nov 25 15:38:01 +0000 2012,Were our spinners trying too hard to get wickets?
272699412575293440,Sun Nov 25 13:53:01 +0000 2012,Hot topic of discussion- "Pace" of spinners!
272699189815808000,Sun Nov 25 13:52:08 +0000 2012,Is India more vulnerable against spin or did the English spinners bowl better??
272642558289670140,Sun Nov 25 10:07:06 +0000 2012,English spinners are clearly exploiting the conditions better.

272554183620694000,Sun Nov 25 04:15:55 +0000 2012,Close in fielders @ slips need to keep low at the point of impact between bat and ball. That's a basic!
272552390002098180,Sun Nov 25 04:08:48 +0000 2012,Could've done with a better start
272374810863095800,Sat Nov 24 16:23:10 +0000 2012,Maybe, Our Spinners should bowl as per their strengths. Just get a feeling they are trying to bowl too fast to get purchase from the pitch
