125489419766607870,Sun Oct 16 08:33:03 +0000 2011,the person who first instilled this notion of #RadicalTransparancy was @JPBarlow - it took me this long to embrace it #LiveYourTruth
125488964068061180,Sun Oct 16 08:31:15 +0000 2011,. @GUNNARSjem in a sense though, i drinking my own kool-aid by believing in this idea of #RadicalTransparency, be a hypocrite to resist it

125486467316322300,Sun Oct 16 08:21:19 +0000 2011,Glad to see @JPBarlow trumpeting the #OWS cause - he and I have been quietly anticipating and hoping for bonafide social movement for awhile
125485721988509700,Sun Oct 16 08:18:22 +0000 2011,Some are shocked by my admission of indulgence w @SnoopDogg. Does anyone recall that POTUS once wrote, ‚ÄúI inhaled ‚Äî that was the point.‚Äù ?

124856294023766020,Fri Oct 14 14:37:14 +0000 2011,totally agree with this point, @Loren_Michael ... having a party and protesting are not incompatible. happened in the 60s too

124852160012894200,Fri Oct 14 14:20:49 +0000 2011,I support #OWS (in principle), @UberGeekGirl, but feel some levity is needed in the debate, many "protesters" wouldnt be there it wasn't fun
124848567490850820,Fri Oct 14 14:06:32 +0000 2011,ok ok, the #OWS remark was a joke, sort of...it's true that most protesters don't know why they're there and they are having a good time
124844898024292350,Fri Oct 14 13:51:57 +0000 2011,do we really believe that #OWS is anything other than an excuse for bored (possibly unemployed) people to have a great big party?

124761452765642750,Fri Oct 14 08:20:22 +0000 2011,Schools gave up on teaching kids to think or how to learn, to impart tools for analysis, critical thinking, etc. Give a man a fish.....
124760970915618820,Fri Oct 14 08:18:28 +0000 2011,Rather than perceiving knowledge to be a set of human constructed tools for making sense of the world, derived by humans for humans
124760633152512000,Fri Oct 14 08:17:07 +0000 2011,The effect is rote memorization or at best poorly integrated knowledge. Students perceive knowledge as something "out there" to be acquired
124759947643850750,Fri Oct 14 08:14:24 +0000 2011,Nothing in that model sparks a child's curiosity or creative drive, it's ultimately disenfranchising to the student.
124759398106144770,Fri Oct 14 08:12:13 +0000 2011,Teachers (K-12) are preoccupied w standardized testing/measurement, schools might as well give up on general education and become vocational
124758181401468930,Fri Oct 14 08:07:22 +0000 2011,I'm w you guys on education - crying out for reinvention. Emphasis on metrics and testing (NCLB) have crushed remaining hope for reform.
