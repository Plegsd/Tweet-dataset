419549091505246200,Sat Jan 04 19:21:12 +0000 2014,Who wants to come over for a BBQ? http://t.co/rnoC1u1DFj
419494740711579650,Sat Jan 04 15:45:14 +0000 2014,Also, people who don't move their cars off the street for street cleaning. Last time you could seriously toboggan down the mounds left.
419494376524353540,Sat Jan 04 15:43:47 +0000 2014,Winter pet peeves- people who shovel their snow into the alley AFTER the plow has gone through. Feels like you're driving on a BMX track.
419136317973205000,Fri Jan 03 16:01:00 +0000 2014,@thatgriffingirl I think it's just you and I. Maybe I will sing a different tune when I have to walk in it starting Monday :)
419127010665828350,Fri Jan 03 15:24:01 +0000 2014,Yes, yes, yes. It was colder in Winnipeg than on Mars and the North Pole. Let's just say the universe and move on.

226021162633789440,Thu Jul 19 18:30:19 +0000 2012,Sat down in a patch of grass and into a whole that fit my ass perfectly. It's like a grass hug for my bum!
225916187740106750,Thu Jul 19 11:33:11 +0000 2012,However I am an idiot one. There's another door that I have a key to get into the office. D'OH!
225914261820542980,Thu Jul 19 11:25:31 +0000 2012,Day 2 - Not wanting to be an absentee producer, I came to work early. Sadly no one else had the same idea and I'm locked out.
225907905050865660,Thu Jul 19 11:00:16 +0000 2012,I don't know the etiquette on how long before you do another tweet - I just looked up from my last one and some naked guy was in the window.

225736105947971600,Wed Jul 18 23:37:36 +0000 2012,With the end of LTK I thought I'd be done with nudity riders. So tired of talking about butts, nipples and masturbating. Sigh.
225671285143900160,Wed Jul 18 19:20:01 +0000 2012,Day 1 so far - laughed loudly during private blocking and leaned on a light switch and turned it off. I have been banished to outside. :)

5921887176,Sat Nov 21 16:24:15 +0000 2009,@ctyson Dog training is hard! I thought I wasdoing such a good job, came home and there was white all over my dog's nose, she ate the wall.
5919449115,Sat Nov 21 14:29:49 +0000 2009,No one ever just 'stops by' anymore. You know, like, "Hey, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd come and say hello". That's sad.

5362951251,Mon Nov 02 13:36:03 +0000 2009,Monday, Monday, not so good to me. I'm already looking forward to Friday!
5326663294,Sun Nov 01 00:39:46 +0000 2009,@Jen_Beasley don't they like it? i'm sure if it involved the pot calling the kettle black, it would be hysterical.
5326640311,Sun Nov 01 00:38:31 +0000 2009,A garbage bag with a hole cut out for your head and arms does not constitute a costume. NO CANDY FOR YOU!
