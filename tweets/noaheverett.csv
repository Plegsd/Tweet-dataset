1094650564451930100,Sun Feb 10 17:33:26 +0000 2019,8) God loves you and has plans for you.
1094650563868930000,Sun Feb 10 17:33:26 +0000 2019,7) Life isn't a straight line and things will work out differently than you thought, but the end result is better.
1094650563277533200,Sun Feb 10 17:33:26 +0000 2019,6) How you view things, the way you think and the way you talk will change. That's ok, it's part of growing.
1094650562791002100,Sun Feb 10 17:33:26 +0000 2019,5) Forgive others, you've been forgiven much.
1094650562237382700,Sun Feb 10 17:33:26 +0000 2019,4) Stop worrying, that doesn't help you. Stay calm and work the problem.
1094650561536901100,Sun Feb 10 17:33:26 +0000 2019,3) Chasing quick pleasures, while fun in the moment, will hurt you in the long run. (Drugs, drinking, relationships, etc)
1094650559959834600,Sun Feb 10 17:33:25 +0000 2019,2) Do not worry what people think about you, forget your reputation. Being in the "good graces" of everyone isn't p‚Ä¶ https://t.co/T8jaVdFVNe

720386601663094800,Wed Apr 13 23:02:04 +0000 2016,@interactivered interesting...what kind of volume do you do with that SMTP server?
720385502797369300,Wed Apr 13 22:57:42 +0000 2016,@interactivered yeah...I think its @digialocean, from my research it seems their IP space is largely considered "spam" by email providers
720376919695306800,Wed Apr 13 22:23:36 +0000 2016,@noahhlo I assume its @Digitalocean having bad IP rep since we have SPF, DKIM, DMARC, rDNS &amp; emails are well formed. New host is next try :)

687318933662220300,Wed Jan 13 17:02:58 +0000 2016,@vlucas rock on...just downloaded it to my iPhone
687314539650674700,Wed Jan 13 16:45:30 +0000 2016,@Philoushka thanks for subscribing Phil!
687314401234391000,Wed Jan 13 16:44:57 +0000 2016,@vlucas are you writing each platform independently using Swift / Java or using a cross-platform framework like Ionic?
687312624497913900,Wed Jan 13 16:37:53 +0000 2016,@vlucas oh cool, looking at it now...I could actually use this with my diet / workout plan
687312323921461200,Wed Jan 13 16:36:42 +0000 2016,@DelinaDimova so far it's easier and cleaner via Pingly to chat...as far as more connected, I guess I'll know that in time :)
687311559308259300,Wed Jan 13 16:33:40 +0000 2016,@vlucas let me know when you release it, would like to check it out
687311169816768500,Wed Jan 13 16:32:07 +0000 2016,@DelinaDimova frustrated with email over years, it's clunky when used to msg ppl, wanted a "chat" style app that worked over other networks
687310356205682700,Wed Jan 13 16:28:53 +0000 2016,@mrdoob since Twitter acquired it they may have added the comment export, but I'm honestly not for sure, sorry I couldn't be of more help!
687308725527408600,Wed Jan 13 16:22:24 +0000 2016,@vlucas thanks man! I hope you still do it...would it be about the app we chatted about last year?
687307949501485000,Wed Jan 13 16:19:19 +0000 2016,@DelinaDimova it's a messaging app the works over Email &amp; SMS, this way even if your contacts aren't on Pingly you can still talk with them
687306869170397200,Wed Jan 13 16:15:01 +0000 2016,@DelinaDimova thanks Delina! appreciate the kind words

685230801299095600,Thu Jan 07 22:45:28 +0000 2016,@robgt haha true...Medium is free though too correct? However with Wordpress you have infinitely more control
685229758255378400,Thu Jan 07 22:41:19 +0000 2016,@jsndacruz if they increase the Tweet size to 10k characters then that could be a possibility haha
685229630714986500,Thu Jan 07 22:40:49 +0000 2016,@robgt love wordpress, used it over the years...I've seen blogs like Signal Vs Noise by Basecamp move to Medium though
685229422333530100,Thu Jan 07 22:39:59 +0000 2016,@SirWoodtheGood I guess that's what the 'Other' option is for :)

682256136888807400,Wed Dec 30 17:45:13 +0000 2015,@Ryohara oh I gotcha...I'm experimenting with a 'Connections' feature that might be able to help with that or at least prioritize messages
682254332708913200,Wed Dec 30 17:38:03 +0000 2015,@Ryohara Pingly resides on the consumer side of messaging as a direct messaging app, are you looking more for an email marketing platform?

673940768059453400,Mon Dec 07 19:02:54 +0000 2015,@anthness setting -webkit-scrollbar width to 0 works, but you lose the floating scrollbars too or use a jquery scrollbar plugin, both icky
673940169087713300,Mon Dec 07 19:00:32 +0000 2015,@anthness yeah but only on with OSX where a system setting causing the non-floating scrollbars to display and adds 30'ish pixel padding

448515832432590850,Tue Mar 25 17:44:42 +0000 2014,Language defines the product. The use of it is important when trying to convey your product's message....Apple does this well #uxdesign
448484289056092160,Tue Mar 25 15:39:21 +0000 2014,@kenusmansmith11 haha
448484258928414700,Tue Mar 25 15:39:14 +0000 2014,@Bensonix I believe it's from crawlers and bots indexing new content on Twitpic (i.e. Google, Twitter, etc)
448484126677807100,Tue Mar 25 15:38:42 +0000 2014,@Axe_Grrl I learned about that one yesterday too...normally I would have used one of the others

448231145042620400,Mon Mar 24 22:53:27 +0000 2014,@TheOneAW spell check didn't help either since peak is a word as well
448230989303926800,Mon Mar 24 22:52:50 +0000 2014,@TheCammyGirl I feel like there is a song with those lyrics
448230739122069500,Mon Mar 24 22:51:50 +0000 2014,@ilovemppb I called the grammar police on myself #whoopwhoop
448230458141450240,Mon Mar 24 22:50:43 +0000 2014,@menehunemedia I must be confused about something :) Offer for hug still stands though...also Wildcats kicked butt yesterday
448227877520420860,Mon Mar 24 22:40:28 +0000 2014,@KenFromChicago hard for the brain / spell checkers to catch since they are real words
448226932011053060,Mon Mar 24 22:36:42 +0000 2014,@suziecuez spell check couldn't catch it either since it is technically a word, but wrong context
448226807226302460,Mon Mar 24 22:36:13 +0000 2014,@scribblygum ah yes...I may get the later one wrong as well
448226690435907600,Mon Mar 24 22:35:45 +0000 2014,@notsoprivaterye that's another good one
448226488136245250,Mon Mar 24 22:34:57 +0000 2014,@taximanpaul actually what we're launching isn't related to Twitter at all...it is in the messaging app genre though

448225364733882400,Mon Mar 24 22:30:29 +0000 2014,@McRieger at least I can say I know two languages...english and bad english
448225269904834560,Mon Mar 24 22:30:06 +0000 2014,@Jill_Sinclair not really, but then after re-reading I felt stupid :)
448225195460157440,Mon Mar 24 22:29:48 +0000 2014,@alysonshane I even re-read the tweet multiple times before posting and my brain didn't catch it
448224217570758660,Mon Mar 24 22:25:55 +0000 2014,@billiegirltoo good one haha
448223920328806400,Mon Mar 24 22:24:44 +0000 2014,One of the few (only) things I can pride myself with is getting there/their/they're correct...yet today I used peak instead of peek #isuck
448220788605599740,Mon Mar 24 22:12:18 +0000 2014,@menehunemedia it's a scam because I misspelled a word? you need a hug today or something?

448195425590607900,Mon Mar 24 20:31:31 +0000 2014,@designer_mike I noticed that recently too (after I had already designed the current logo)...it's modified from a font icon set

448192462587437060,Mon Mar 24 20:19:44 +0000 2014,@AlexMonaghanUK @YesScotland that my spacing is off or that it makes an X? :)

443467666167431200,Tue Mar 11 19:25:05 +0000 2014,@tweet_stratford the aiming / shooting dynamics of Battlefield 4 are way different than CoD and so I suck at it haha
443466577846222850,Tue Mar 11 19:20:46 +0000 2014,Since I suck at Battlefield 4, anyone have CoD Ghosts on Xbox One they want to trade straight up? To keep shipping cheap can do US only

433658933744373760,Wed Feb 12 17:48:41 +0000 2014,@nirvdrum @JEG2 ran into issues with gems not being compatible with JRuby or is that rare?
433658006023049200,Wed Feb 12 17:45:00 +0000 2014,@JEG2 haha...we rely heavily on caching to keep our db's from getting swamped...also SSD for DB has been a HUGE improvement
433654962824818700,Wed Feb 12 17:32:54 +0000 2014,@JEG2 ah! did not know that...thanks again for the info, gonna run some benchmarks on my end to simulate our traffic load
433639875535839200,Wed Feb 12 16:32:57 +0000 2014,@JEG2 for a high traffic / load site (aka Twitpic) would you recommend JRuby over 2.1 MRI?
433636176906297340,Wed Feb 12 16:18:15 +0000 2014,@JEG2 ok that makes better sense now...thanks for explaining
433604333188300800,Wed Feb 12 14:11:43 +0000 2014,@JEG2 ...also am I understanding correctly that JRuby is threaded while Ruby isn't thread safe? So JRuby can do parallel processing?
433604033765330940,Wed Feb 12 14:10:32 +0000 2014,@JEG2 I've seen some benchmarks (http://t.co/XvNLseDUS7) that show Ruby 2.1 as fast or faster than JRuby, is that true?...
