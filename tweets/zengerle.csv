758446667305582600,Wed Jul 27 23:39:11 +0000 2016,Obama moved on to another group of reporters. We were speechless. Finally, Tim said, "That man's going to be president some day."
758446277432533000,Wed Jul 27 23:37:38 +0000 2016,"You see a picture of a skinny guy w/ big ears and you think it's me?" he asked. It was brilliant. He was pissed but it was cloaked in humor
758445981763383300,Wed Jul 27 23:36:27 +0000 2016,"I wasn't drawing pictures of myself!" he said. He grabbed Ryan's ntbk &amp; did a doodle. He showed it to Tim &amp; me: skinny guy w/ big ears.
758445590170570800,Wed Jul 27 23:34:54 +0000 2016,...as evidenced by the fact that Obama would draw doodles of himself while he made fundraising calls. Obama saw us &amp; made a b-line for Ryan.
758445353444057100,Wed Jul 27 23:33:58 +0000 2016,Ryan had just written piece aboutt Obama for The Atlantic. It was a very positive piece, save for one line about Obama's self-regard...
758444868267946000,Wed Jul 27 23:32:02 +0000 2016,My own reminiscence: I went to press lunch for Obama the day of his speech at  Colonnade Hotel. Was standing w/ @RyanLizza &amp; @TimothyNoah1.
