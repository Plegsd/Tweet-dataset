318916301269631000,Tue Apr 02 02:42:26 +0000 2013,@iABtastic Agreed :)
318914766947119100,Tue Apr 02 02:36:20 +0000 2013,@iABtastic There's a daily cap on reviews now, and better spam-control, so quality shouldn't really be affected for the worse.
318913805419683840,Tue Apr 02 02:32:31 +0000 2013,@iABtastic We understand, AB. It was planned and rolled out very quickly (like most things we do). Update info was posted here + on site :)
318808784686428160,Mon Apr 01 19:35:12 +0000 2013,@sahibagursahane Yep, we will!
318807125973409800,Mon Apr 01 19:28:36 +0000 2013,@sahibagursahane Not if you write more reviews - up to 4 a day count towards the Leaderboard :)
318806899959160800,Mon Apr 01 19:27:42 +0000 2013,@FoodnPeace Tweaked the Leaderboard eligibility criteria a bit; sorry it came as a bit of a surprise :(

318800732511928300,Mon Apr 01 19:03:12 +0000 2013,@sahibagursahane And fret not, the spam filter is being modified to try and prevent spam reviews from going through!
318800371126501400,Mon Apr 01 19:01:46 +0000 2013,@sahibagursahane The 44 are eligible for the Leaderboard (written in the past 90 days). The 127 are safe: http://t.co/KS7QXT60WK :)

318798495647662100,Mon Apr 01 18:54:19 +0000 2013,@sahibagursahane They go a long, long way towards helping other foodies! This is just upping the competition on the Leaderboard a bit :)
