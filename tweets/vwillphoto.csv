8693493672,Fri Feb 05 21:09:21 +0000 2010,@davidfield1 ha. not exactly. Off to go find a nice human form!
8693454826,Fri Feb 05 21:08:12 +0000 2010,@davidfield1 His challenge didn't come through. (see screen grab) Rebooted. Now I'm finally on board.  http://tweetphoto.com/10501373
8692869731,Fri Feb 05 20:51:09 +0000 2010,@davidfield1  I cut and pasted it off what my twitter says. Guess it didn't all come through. But that makes mores sense.!
8692631631,Fri Feb 05 20:44:02 +0000 2010,@davidfield1 re-read it. I was just trying to help you out and clarify.
8692604266,Fri Feb 05 20:43:13 +0000 2010,Robert's challenge: "The Figure Study‚Äù From the beginning, it has been and remains a favorite subject of artists. Let the human form be you"
8689358926,Fri Feb 05 19:06:49 +0000 2010,@hassyusa only time is doesn't is anything requiring a high ISO or long exposure and I can live with that!
8689339512,Fri Feb 05 19:06:15 +0000 2010,@hassyusa  is so impressive. I often shoot with both and then bring up the files side by side to compare. Hassy wins hands down
8689283679,Fri Feb 05 19:04:40 +0000 2010,@hassyusa I now adore the medium format and use it for almost all my work. my canon has become my backup camera. the color and image quality
8689184560,Fri Feb 05 19:01:47 +0000 2010,@hassyusa I wasn't sure if the hassy was going to be able to do everything I needed it to compared to my canon. but I have been so surprised
8688781928,Fri Feb 05 18:50:05 +0000 2010,@davidfield1 I think its a figure study but we are the form so its both. a figure study and a self-portrait.
8678720357,Fri Feb 05 14:22:11 +0000 2010,@robertmanella Great challenge! Self-portrait it is.
8637315008,Thu Feb 04 16:01:07 +0000 2010,@robertmanella Nice self-portrait! That would have been a fun idea for a challenge. Looking forward to seeing what you choose for this week!

8153626767,Sun Jan 24 16:04:11 +0000 2010,I'd love to see more images of what you love from the hassynyc community. Its fun to see unique interpretations of the idea!
8153440225,Sun Jan 24 15:57:59 +0000 2010,Anyone else want to show the Hassynyc community what they love by posting a pix? We are all interested in seeing!
8153164437,Sun Jan 24 15:48:15 +0000 2010,@jessefreidin  If only I could dress my dog old Hollywood style.  Great pic. Thanks for posting!
8005019307,Wed Jan 20 23:44:34 +0000 2010,@robertmanella  Absolutely lovely! Is that your family?
7934434147,Tue Jan 19 05:14:27 +0000 2010,@davidfield1 Thanks David. I was impressed how the hassy handled his fast movement. For not being a "fast" camera, it did really well.
7871782270,Sun Jan 17 18:27:42 +0000 2010,Going to upload my challenge on Monday morning when I'm back at home base. Looking forward to seeing who or what we so fond of. #hassynyc
7763461314,Thu Jan 14 22:12:13 +0000 2010,Im enjoying the f-stop and end point control in the histogram along with the loupe and navigator change in Phocus 2.0.
7752844576,Thu Jan 14 16:21:48 +0000 2010,Coming from a 35mm camera the H3D never cease to amaze. The images have a quality to them that just blow away the competition.
7752793985,Thu Jan 14 16:20:12 +0000 2010,I purposefully left my challenge vague wondering how we would interpret "love in different ways. I'm pretty in love with my H3D.
7670043551,Tue Jan 12 14:17:43 +0000 2010,I picked my challenge because one thing I love most about photography is the intimacy that a camera allows some situations.
7669911875,Tue Jan 12 14:13:25 +0000 2010,To recap my challenge, it's to photograph someone or something you love. Im hoping you will get to know us a bit better by what we post.
7638940569,Mon Jan 11 18:52:04 +0000 2010,my model for this shoot had different color eyes. pretty cool! http://bit.ly/5XsodD
7618821841,Mon Jan 11 04:50:29 +0000 2010,What I love best about portraits: the intimacy & interaction with the subject. Its about making a photo that represents the experience had.
7618706697,Mon Jan 11 04:46:16 +0000 2010,This week its my turn to pick a theme.  In an attempt to get to know us better, I think we should photograph someone or something we love.
7560229935,Sat Jan 09 15:48:22 +0000 2010,I concur with the others. I'm enjoying the improvements in Phocus 2.0 quite a bit.
7406172782,Tue Jan 05 15:29:38 +0000 2010,Big photoshoot happening on my street today for a TV show. Guess which camera the photog is using?  A nice Hasselblad H3D

7273629455,Fri Jan 01 17:17:18 +0000 2010,It's 2010! You know what that means? The H4D is getting closer and closer! I can't wait.
7236617984,Thu Dec 31 15:15:08 +0000 2009,@richburroughs Not quite yet. I wish! The HD3 39 II. The H4D won't be available for another month or two.

6842467938,Sat Dec 19 23:09:33 +0000 2009,@Midwest here it is:  http://bit.ly/8Ls6DX wish you could see it BIG. the detail is great and its straight out of the camera (minus the b+w)
6841338604,Sat Dec 19 22:21:48 +0000 2009,I'm impressed that the details in my challenge image are so sharp at a 3 sec exposure late at night.  Very little noise as well.
6841271343,Sat Dec 19 22:18:54 +0000 2009,I FINALLY found a scene that I think signifies "The City that Never Sleeps" in 1 image.  Its a 3 sec exposure and sharp as a tack.
6817783789,Sat Dec 19 03:08:08 +0000 2009,@gothamtomato I use a tenba backback or combination of that and Thinktank gear.  I lens pack according to subject matter but usually my 50.

6209403628,Mon Nov 30 18:44:19 +0000 2009,Platon has the most wonderful understanding of human nature + integrity. Any photographer can learn a great deal from just listening.
6209360648,Mon Nov 30 18:42:38 +0000 2009,Platon's portfolio is incredible but you MUST check out is audio commentary on each image.  Its just fantastic! http://bit.ly/63XQFQ

5601524574,Tue Nov 10 22:33:01 +0000 2009,@thomdahl thanks! thats my inspirations board at the moment.
5601509394,Tue Nov 10 22:32:26 +0000 2009,@ikonikphoto  I'm using the H3D II 39 right now.
5580529715,Tue Nov 10 04:44:50 +0000 2009,Can't really get over how much I enjoy shooting with the Hasselblad. been shooting 2x as much. It feels like a new toy on Christmas morning.
5511532986,Sat Nov 07 18:14:01 +0000 2009,I'm comparing files from lightroom, bridge/camera raw and Phocus. Will let you know what I think is best and why.
5507620088,Sat Nov 07 15:06:33 +0000 2009,@flickrfotog Thxs! I cant believe how far the prank went. So fun to train the actor to be a photog. TV GUIDE nxt week has my photos.
5507558633,Sat Nov 07 15:03:28 +0000 2009,The lens correction in the Phocus software is unprecedented. Not just architectural photogs will benefit. All photogs will. Try it!
5507443864,Sat Nov 07 14:57:45 +0000 2009,@nickt_ http://bit.ly/6aE98. Hope you think its as funny as it was to be there!
5488975236,Fri Nov 06 21:06:34 +0000 2009,If you haven't tried Phocus for editing and processing,  you should!
5480485544,Fri Nov 06 15:10:46 +0000 2009,My favorite part of Phocus is the ability to batch files and either process them or keyword and properly caption for archiving purposes.
5462752087,Thu Nov 05 23:00:07 +0000 2009,Watch the Today Show on NBC tomorrow to see me and a SURPRISE. They are airing a segment I worked on with TV GUIDE. Its worth it. Trust me.
5449003175,Thu Nov 05 13:17:58 +0000 2009,Helping another photog with a fashion shoot this morning. hope it doesn't rain!
5448992061,Thu Nov 05 13:17:21 +0000 2009,@flickrfotog that can be arranged! Thanks for the twitter tips. Still getting used to this whole thing.
5432581251,Wed Nov 04 22:37:48 +0000 2009,Time to step outside the box. Just had a great idea for a series inspired by a conversation with @nickt_ Off to fotocare!
5431827207,Wed Nov 04 22:07:08 +0000 2009,@nickt_ Already done that! Paul at Hasselblad made that suggestion right from the get-go. thnx.
5431488895,Wed Nov 04 21:53:35 +0000 2009,@nickt_thanks for the tip. I love all settings the 39 has that my canon mkIII doesn't. such pleasant surprises.
5431407379,Wed Nov 04 21:50:18 +0000 2009,@flickrfotog Been on twitter about a week! still getting used to it. any suggestions?
5428527101,Wed Nov 04 19:47:31 +0000 2009,Its such a beautiful day in New York. I'm gonna to go take a break from editing and see how the H3D 39 handles available light.
5427846530,Wed Nov 04 19:17:26 +0000 2009,Editing today. Not a fan of iphoto really. The tools are crude corrections. Not enough control. I much prefer lightroom and Phocus.
5402639081,Tue Nov 03 21:48:34 +0000 2009,vote here everyone! http://twtpoll.com/vqf7ss #hassynyc
5400365302,Tue Nov 03 20:11:05 +0000 2009,Phocus Phocus Phocus. Really getting fluent in this software. Its speeding up my work flow quite a bit. Who doesn't love custom functions?
5371705421,Mon Nov 02 20:14:10 +0000 2009,http://tweetphoto.com/2babbf My first photo with the H3D II 39.
5367451085,Mon Nov 02 17:01:43 +0000 2009,Uploaded my 1st pic from the 39. What a handsome camera! Took it out for a first date, but I think I'm in love. Can't wait for the 2nd date!
5277391001,Fri Oct 30 02:44:41 +0000 2009,Used the 39 on a shoot for the 1st time. Edge to edge the photos are tremendous improvement from what I'm used to with 33mm.
5243734894,Wed Oct 28 23:20:48 +0000 2009,Its Victorian inspired ball gowns tomorrow with the hassy. Looking forward to seeing what this camera can really do. #hassynyc
5243442502,Wed Oct 28 23:08:53 +0000 2009,@Ingvardsen Thanks! He was quite an interesting guy to observe and listen and watch. Never a dull moment.
5243330499,Wed Oct 28 23:04:19 +0000 2009,@Benspell Thanks! I love shooting portraits. Each one is small adventure part of a bigger odyssey.
5209011313,Tue Oct 27 19:44:10 +0000 2009,I spent the day learning and customizing my hassy and Phocus preferences for a smooth work flow. Both were easy and fun to individualize.
5172441611,Mon Oct 26 13:14:28 +0000 2009,Photo East is over. Saw a lot of inspiring things. Now I'm ready to learn my new camera and get started putting my ideas into pixels.
5063203351,Thu Oct 22 06:05:50 +0000 2009,Looking forward to be part of a series of challenges in the mastery of photography, ranging from the complex to the simple. #hassynyc
