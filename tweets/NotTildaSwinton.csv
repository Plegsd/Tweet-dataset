205034488764440580,Tue May 22 20:36:46 +0000 2012,@M_Morse You speak of a fictional "Narnia" book.  Run your hands across the pages it's printed on, and feel the story of the trees before.
205033730530738180,Tue May 22 20:33:45 +0000 2012,I climb my favourite tree, where I find a nest.  Eagle eggs lie inside.  I give them gentle kisses.  These eagles will be born with my face.
205033030933430270,Tue May 22 20:30:58 +0000 2012,I grow towards one thousand followers.  Theremiah devours your devotion like so many small mice.  He grows larger, more confident.

205022701436411900,Tue May 22 19:49:55 +0000 2012,I exist then, now, and forever.  Favs?  RTs?  When your last breath frees your soul, I will be there to inhale it, and carry you always.
205021857903161340,Tue May 22 19:46:34 +0000 2012,@nottjmiller I watched your film Yogi Bear, and enjoyed it.  However, you cannot harness a bear as so.  Beasts of such majesty wear no hats.
205018906681806850,Tue May 22 19:34:51 +0000 2012,@LianeP @fuggirls Numerous people have told these @fuggirls of me.  If you have business with me, we shall discuss it, but I am wary.
205015543412043780,Tue May 22 19:21:29 +0000 2012,What is your favorite animal?  IRRELEVANT.  We are all extraneous limbs of the earth.  Kneel, and fold yourself to your master's side.
205014547940118530,Tue May 22 19:17:31 +0000 2012,Once you've felt a friend-squirrel's last breath float across your palm, tree sap never tastes as sweet. Rest well in the æther, Terald.
205013258682376200,Tue May 22 19:12:24 +0000 2012,@hayeslady Idea for "Children's Hospital" series.  Child is brought in with dark, dead eyes.  I kiss/wrap him in wet fur.  Reborn as a vole.
205007109916606460,Tue May 22 18:47:58 +0000 2012,Do you know the taste of birch bark in a pool of moonlight?  It is the taste Adam awoke with in the Garden of Æden.
204992287749574660,Tue May 22 17:49:04 +0000 2012,Shall I grow fur today?  Fetch me my mercury thermometer, Theremiah.
204989914394275840,Tue May 22 17:39:38 +0000 2012,I grow full with recognition.  You think you are observing me, but your follows are knots to the marionette strings on my delicate fingers.
204988185804148740,Tue May 22 17:32:46 +0000 2012,I lay in a claw-footed bath filled with elderberries gathered by my bat, Theremiah.  They stain my skin... I will be camouflaged this night.
204987513167814660,Tue May 22 17:30:06 +0000 2012,Draw a bath of steaming mineral water for you and your flesh-companion. Then put your faces up to one another and scream without blinking
204978610690461700,Tue May 22 16:54:43 +0000 2012,My stomach whines with hunger as I sit by the pond.  A carp jumps out and impales itself on a stick in front of me. "Namaste," I whisper.
204957063531610100,Tue May 22 15:29:06 +0000 2012,I shrink myself to the size of an ant and climb within a falcon.  I operate his neurons as reins to a horse, soaring high.  Happy Tuesday.
204936243111399420,Tue May 22 14:06:22 +0000 2012,For break-fast I will have sunlight.  Boring, I know, but such an old standby deserves respect.
204928921878265860,Tue May 22 13:37:17 +0000 2012,Good morning.  Do you guys not hate it when you awake to find your arms and legs have switched overnight?  Off to my laboratory once again.
204833449264160770,Tue May 22 07:17:54 +0000 2012,A robe of live squirrels is finer than pearls.
204832773016526850,Tue May 22 07:15:13 +0000 2012,I slither among the wet leaves, tasting the wet earth.  I curl around a tree trunk to take my rest.  The tree whispers of my greatness.
204831814106361860,Tue May 22 07:11:24 +0000 2012,My uterus is ripe.  I ache to carry offspring.  Please DM if you are of swarthy build and sharp will.

204805060633427970,Tue May 22 05:25:06 +0000 2012,I descend into my grotto.  My gills flick out of my neck and provide me with oxygen as I gather seaweed for tomorrow's brunch.
204798748415635460,Tue May 22 05:00:01 +0000 2012,I am running low on deer blood.  I suppose tomorrow shall be another hunt day.
204796583236214800,Tue May 22 04:51:25 +0000 2012,RT if you keep your ribcage on a hook of finest silver while you slumber.
204795174361112580,Tue May 22 04:45:49 +0000 2012,I am forever in a play.  This play is your life.  My role?  It is you.  You look to the top of the screen.  This is your account.  SEND.
204793404075413500,Tue May 22 04:38:47 +0000 2012,I spring from tree to tree, following you on the forest floor.  I drop in front of you, perform a scene from "Othello."  You are my pawn.
204777136660295680,Tue May 22 03:34:08 +0000 2012,I greet the moon. My wings emerge from my back; I soar to the top of my keep. I am untouchable. A gryphon lands next to me. We french.
204762702315393020,Tue May 22 02:36:47 +0000 2012,Darkness falls.  I sit on my throne of bone and await the evening's offering.  My bat servant, Theremiah, returns to roost.
204483687729991680,Mon May 21 08:08:04 +0000 2012,The eclipse has given me much power.  My skin glows.  Tonight I feast on large game.
