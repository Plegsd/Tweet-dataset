777903519273594900,Mon Sep 19 16:13:46 +0000 2016,6. These, plus affordability and service of the changing face of college students, are the sorts of things we should measure and learn from.
777903409785561100,Mon Sep 19 16:13:20 +0000 2016,5. They also evaluate how institutions serve their students, particularly adult students, who are now 40% of total enrollment.
777902202442571800,Mon Sep 19 16:08:32 +0000 2016,4. These go beyond just giving credit for enrolling low-income students and add in credit for whether they graduate.
