475025697639903200,Fri Jun 06 21:25:26 +0000 2014,Swift is a pragmatic, not a religious, language.  It tries to get the defaults right, but allows you to change them if it doesn't suit you.

474730716941385700,Fri Jun 06 01:53:17 +0000 2014,Namespacing is implicit in swift, all classes (etc) are implicitly scoped by the module (Xcode target) they are in. no class prefixes needed
