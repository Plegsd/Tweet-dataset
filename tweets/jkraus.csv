2195998034,Tue Jun 16 18:53:23 +0000 2009,#T4E just met with @vkhosla (long time mentor). Loved his quote ''freedom to fail gives me the opportunity to succeed.' So true.
2179642444,Mon Jun 15 16:23:05 +0000 2009,#T4E make sure to put ur biz model into beta at the same time u put ur product into beta. Otherwise u think ur learning but ur not.
2172401982,Mon Jun 15 02:15:17 +0000 2009,Don't you hate it when the 3 yr old sitting next to u vomits all over ur shoes when you're at Sesame Street Live with your kids? Yeah, me 2.
2133403373,Fri Jun 12 16:41:14 +0000 2009,#T4E dont forget raising money (mostly VC) llimits your liquidity options. $ r great but consider how it narrows who can afford 2 buy u.
2121349570,Thu Jun 11 20:01:48 +0000 2009,Wow. Post-it note stop motion video. Incredible.  http://bit.ly/2C1woF  (via @kcoleman)
2119167217,Thu Jun 11 16:59:11 +0000 2009,#T4E At a minimum do 'watercooler' testing of your UIs. Use neighbors, friends. Even a little data beats a guess. http://bit.ly/QBCZu
2107018351,Wed Jun 10 19:13:19 +0000 2009,@katiejstanton I like paycycle for this kind of thing
2104878198,Wed Jun 10 16:09:35 +0000 2009,Doing pushups next to Jerry Rice. For the record he is *much* better at pushups than I am.
2103712431,Wed Jun 10 14:30:23 +0000 2009,T4E 1 of my fav sayings 'being early is the same as being wrong.' Feels the same. No buyers, no market, no press. Its why early is so bad
2092061251,Tue Jun 09 17:35:32 +0000 2009,#T4E 'Where u start affects where u finish'. Once u launch it's hard to radically change what ur doing. Pick ur launch features carefully.
2092024318,Tue Jun 09 17:32:22 +0000 2009,Watched a kindergarden performance of high school musical. I was amazed and terrified.
2077834075,Mon Jun 08 16:29:26 +0000 2009,#T4E When ur gut says someone has 2 go, u must act. We delay&say 'someone is better than no one' but the wrong person is *worse* than no one
2044780840,Fri Jun 05 16:48:53 +0000 2009,@gregd you know you've made it when there is a YouTube video mocking u. Congrats! Love the piano playing cat.
2044660992,Fri Jun 05 16:39:27 +0000 2009,#T4E creating a new user habit or breaking an existing one is your hardest challenge (it's much much harder than building a great product.)
2023887419,Thu Jun 04 01:23:16 +0000 2009,@mikejkim say hi to KC for me!
2019712083,Wed Jun 03 18:56:38 +0000 2009,@mashagenzel Final tabled my warm up tourney the night before. Busted out of World Series when my AA got cracked by 99. Bummer.
2019703466,Wed Jun 03 18:55:53 +0000 2009,#T4E Become a world class interviewer. Identifying talent is as deep & rich a problem as any in engineering. Yet most people just 'wing it'.
2009026599,Tue Jun 02 22:02:02 +0000 2009,#T4E better to b a trendspotter than a trendsetter. Lead in a category that will exist without u. You'll spend less & have wind at yer back
1994982084,Mon Jun 01 19:45:52 +0000 2009,#T4E stealth mode is *way* overrated. U need feedback on ur ideas far more than you need secrecy. People are way too busy to steal ur idea.
1982314345,Sun May 31 17:57:48 +0000 2009,I'm an idiot. Somehow I loaded my bag in the xray machine wrong. Now its jammed and they're sending humans into the machine to get it. #fail

1951296836,Thu May 28 20:18:27 +0000 2009,#T4E Nothing burns people like the equal treatment of unequals. Treat ur best people differently. Do amazing things 4 them. They make ur co.
1937846688,Wed May 27 17:28:18 +0000 2009,#T4E Best tip I ever heard for being persuasive in a meeting (and I use it all the time): Avoid the temptation to speak first. Speak last.
1926767092,Tue May 26 19:07:06 +0000 2009,@joekraus3 great to have you on Twitter dad!
1926066141,Tue May 26 17:58:36 +0000 2009,T4E. Opportunity creates opportunity in ways difficult to predict. Strive to say yes to the opportunities presented.
1894738315,Sat May 23 17:07:45 +0000 2009,@mikejkim can't believe Nate pooped in the yard. Too funny.
1894429271,Sat May 23 16:29:37 +0000 2009,Daughters 2nd birthday today. Bounce house and, wait for it, pony rides! She's been singing 'happy birthday to me' for days.
1884080991,Fri May 22 16:34:06 +0000 2009,T4E A lesson I learned at Google. Speed is *the* key feature of ur product. Easy to get caught up in other features & forget speed. Don't.
1874803351,Thu May 21 20:11:38 +0000 2009,@acharoo  Most people aren't explicit about it. They want success but aren't willing to do things like hire people better than themselves.
1873496193,Thu May 21 17:59:01 +0000 2009,#T4E  Control or Success? When you start your company, you need to decide *explicitly* which one you care most about. Don't skip this.
1862249138,Wed May 20 18:51:00 +0000 2009,#T4E You spend 10 hours/day thinking about your product. Your potential customers evaluate it in 5 seconds. Keep it simple and be different!
1848965477,Tue May 19 16:44:40 +0000 2009,#T4E 'Hire fast, fire fast' is false entrepreneurial religion.
1837810310,Mon May 18 17:24:04 +0000 2009,#T4E  build products for yourself. your product needs to be a part of *your* daily life. being the customer makes a vastly better product.
1810796361,Fri May 15 22:14:00 +0000 2009,Truly amazing art from folds in paper. http://bit.ly/TawzW
1810261111,Fri May 15 21:08:10 +0000 2009,#T4E  Entrepreneurs should *never* be afraid of big companies unless you are aiming at the very core of their business.
1798175142,Thu May 14 19:23:48 +0000 2009,#T4E  In the tech world, we often try solving problems/disputes thru email or IM. Don't. Get in a room. People solve problems face to face.
1789362429,Wed May 13 23:27:26 +0000 2009,@thinkoutloud #t4e stands for 'tips for entrepreneurs' and it's meant for any helpful tidbits for, no surprise, entrepreneurs.
1786542724,Wed May 13 17:36:32 +0000 2009,Watching @fredwilson talk at Google. The first tech talk I've attended in 2.5 years here.
1784735926,Wed May 13 14:28:34 +0000 2009,#T4E Making other people feel listened to and truly heard, even if u don't agree with them, is at the heart of leadership. Develop that skil
1776460365,Tue May 12 19:26:16 +0000 2009,#T4E Don't talk past the close! Once you get what you came for, get out. Too many get what they want, continue to sell and then lose it.
1768279054,Tue May 12 00:00:47 +0000 2009,@ryangoins  should be fixed now.
1764616003,Mon May 11 16:53:08 +0000 2009,#T4E Take time to celebrate your successes. We tend to focus on the next challenge without stopping to recognize the one we just overcame.
1764479371,Mon May 11 16:36:37 +0000 2009,@ryangoins  i think we now understand the issue. i'll keep you posted as to a fix
1738911544,Fri May 08 16:21:31 +0000 2009,#T4E my favorite product philosophy: 'extend a strength before shoring up a weakness.' As u think about v2 of ur product keep this in mind.
1738886024,Fri May 08 16:18:41 +0000 2009,Liked @lechwe idea. TFE is now T4E.
1729827938,Thu May 07 18:56:44 +0000 2009,TFE: hire slowly and never in desperation. that urgent hire you must have *right now* often turns out to feel unnecessary in 3 months.
1729798108,Thu May 07 18:53:24 +0000 2009,@ryangoins looking into your google profiles issue.
1718665803,Wed May 06 17:36:25 +0000 2009,TFE: learning to trust yourself and your own judgement is a life-long mission for entrepreneurs.
1709571886,Tue May 05 20:18:28 +0000 2009,TFE: build your metrics dashboard *before* you launch. If you don't it a) takes months to do and b) has you flying blind in a crucial time.
1698254546,Mon May 04 18:48:06 +0000 2009,TFE: focus on Operational Tempo. How fast are your release cycles? Product decisions? It's a virtuous cycle. Speed leads 2 more speed.
1683640589,Sun May 03 02:17:39 +0000 2009,At the Van Morisson concert with my wife and @kteare. Please don't rain. Please.
1672843989,Fri May 01 21:00:27 +0000 2009,TFE: rarely can one company affect the trajectory of another. Focus on your company, instead of trying to "do" something to the competition
1670619830,Fri May 01 16:42:16 +0000 2009,Got my picture with McLovin at the Star Trek premiere after party. Chicky-chicky-yeah!
1661317275,Thu Apr 30 18:10:16 +0000 2009,TFE: persistence, more than any other ability, is the key to success. So many of my paths to "yes" began when someone first said "no".
1661277819,Thu Apr 30 18:05:51 +0000 2009,Going to Star trek world premiere tonight in LA. Got my Klingon dictionary. Who's with me!?
1651833424,Wed Apr 29 19:32:15 +0000 2009,TFE: startups = emo rollercoaster. One day u go home & things feel terrible. Next day things feel awesome. But nothing has actually changed.
1642667829,Tue Apr 28 21:03:17 +0000 2009,TFE: When you raise your 1st round of $, immediately create the *ideal* slide deck for raising your 2nd. These are your new company goals
1642665612,Tue Apr 28 21:03:03 +0000 2009,TFE = Tip for Entrepreneurs. Taking too much of my precious character limit
1631571820,Mon Apr 27 19:09:03 +0000 2009,tip for entrepreneurs: Your goal? make $100 in your first month after launch. Then $300, $1000 etc. Launch with your biz model. Do not delay
1625296610,Mon Apr 27 01:53:47 +0000 2009,I liked @jhuber review of my Tesla. "it's a cross between a go kart and a golf cart". U have no idea how true that is.
1606107053,Fri Apr 24 18:29:19 +0000 2009,tip for entrepreneurs: extend an existing user habit with your product, don't try and create a new one.
