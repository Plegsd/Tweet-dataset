848215057007857700,Sat Apr 01 16:46:43 +0000 2017,@stuffofgents absolutely that helped due to the talent he inherited and how he managed them. But how many 5th years did he bring in?
848214740384043000,Sat Apr 01 16:45:27 +0000 2017,@trickle505 @TheLoboLair you just want to make sure the ones you are playing are there for a goal bigger then where the team is at now.
848214617637740500,Sat Apr 01 16:44:58 +0000 2017,@trickle505 @TheLoboLair I agree. You don't have to fill 14 scholarships next year. You can only play and develop so many players.

848213823333044200,Sat Apr 01 16:41:49 +0000 2017,@MMares41 @C_CASEY66 @KDubill10 that he does. You may want to consider upgrading in case Uncle Leo puts you in the above category
848213409464279000,Sat Apr 01 16:40:10 +0000 2017,@stuffofgents they could, but considering we have just seen one play out poorly maybe time to go back to one that played out well.
848213058921148400,Sat Apr 01 16:38:46 +0000 2017,@trickle505 @TheLoboLair point of differential is whether spending a year on the bench behind 5th years will impact development.

848207626181771300,Sat Apr 01 16:17:11 +0000 2017,@TheLoboLair @DrewAdams08 now what do you think the coach is gonna do. Try win now of course. Rinse and repeat.
848207342072102900,Sat Apr 01 16:16:03 +0000 2017,@TheLoboLair @DrewAdams08 that was undoubtedly the plan with players such as Goodman. Except now you are in year two and the pressure is on.
848206403995144200,Sat Apr 01 16:12:20 +0000 2017,@TheLoboLair @DrewAdams08 so in that event you would rather be an average team next year instead of a T-25 and conf champ in a few years?
