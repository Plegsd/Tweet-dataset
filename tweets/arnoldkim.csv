613485108608282600,Tue Jun 23 23:13:42 +0000 2015,@enMTW I don't disagree, but you cant apply gruber's model to everything. Gruber works because his site is his voice. It's very personal.
613484675819024400,Tue Jun 23 23:11:59 +0000 2015,@afwaller @mrgan ya, that's what I was referencing
613483998262730800,Tue Jun 23 23:09:17 +0000 2015,@enMTW I think gruber's model is great but it's harder to scale and is called sponsored content in other circles, which has its own issues.
613483908638900200,Tue Jun 23 23:08:56 +0000 2015,@enMTW I mean it's one that everyone understands.  It's easy.  Requires no reeducation.
613482722250620900,Tue Jun 23 23:04:13 +0000 2015,@davidj ya, additional content is always possible.  Just hard to provide tangible value, and the conversion rates are prob super low
613482305429073900,Tue Jun 23 23:02:34 +0000 2015,@kylebshr @tapbot_paul sound about right.  For us, I think lower. For some, like ars, I think higher
613482000889040900,Tue Jun 23 23:01:21 +0000 2015,@mrgan $10 changes your user title (under username). $20 changes someone ELSE's public user title :)

613481530896330800,Tue Jun 23 22:59:29 +0000 2015,@tapbot_paul nah, we get a broad audience. And safari was always late to the ad blocking game which is our biggest group
613481040057868300,Tue Jun 23 22:57:32 +0000 2015,.@eli_schiff reasonable ad served model makes sense for everyone involved.  Subscriptions relies on a value add over free content.
613480490750865400,Tue Jun 23 22:55:21 +0000 2015,@tapbot_paul depends,  I doing get too concerned about desktop blockers.  But if an ad blocker is the #1 free app... Seems hard to avoid

613477317332049900,Tue Jun 23 22:42:44 +0000 2015,If iOS ad content blockers become commonplace, what's the move for ad-supported web sites?
