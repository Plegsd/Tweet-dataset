311735021692141600,Wed Mar 13 07:06:35 +0000 2013,RT @WoWFactz: Shakespeare wrote the first knock-knock joke.
311600906829443100,Tue Mar 12 22:13:40 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass The work bit?
311600205122400260,Tue Mar 12 22:10:52 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Why?
311599700270792700,Tue Mar 12 22:08:52 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass See! I told you there's a lot of football in doon. Remember, life's only just as awesome as you make it.
311599307079950340,Tue Mar 12 22:07:18 +0000 2013,@avi6282 Well, that's football anyway!
311598791436402700,Tue Mar 12 22:05:15 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass And what did he say?
311598109413232640,Tue Mar 12 22:02:33 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Yup. Arsenal needs funds. We've been on a shoestring budget forever!
311597886028804100,Tue Mar 12 22:01:39 +0000 2013,@avi6282 True. But, I just can't stop feeling bad for Milan. I really like them. Its been a much longer association than the one with Barca.
311597129909014500,Tue Mar 12 21:58:39 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass You call that a rough patch. :) We Gunners have had a rather long one. At least their's isn't dry.
311596553678762000,Tue Mar 12 21:56:22 +0000 2013,@Kunwar5 Chal naa be! When are we meeting up?
311596322643922940,Tue Mar 12 21:55:27 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Anyway, consistency is a synonym for Barcelona.
311596123485773800,Tue Mar 12 21:54:39 +0000 2013,@avi6282 I really haven't seen Barca play like that in a long time.
311594583312191500,Tue Mar 12 21:48:32 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass I'm still at the same shrine kid!
311594464470777860,Tue Mar 12 21:48:04 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass They played some brilliant football tonight.
311594327921008640,Tue Mar 12 21:47:31 +0000 2013,@Kunwar5 LOL. I'm guessing its in favour of EB! (Judging from all the EB tags)
311593488900837400,Tue Mar 12 21:44:11 +0000 2013,Ruthless, relentless aren't usually the adjectives you associate Barcelona with. What were they thinking when they raped and murdered milan!
311592401783361540,Tue Mar 12 21:39:52 +0000 2013,Feeling terrible for Milan. They just got raped.
311416171947765760,Tue Mar 12 09:59:35 +0000 2013,@Zomato I don't seem to be able to find an option for searching for restaurants that offer a tasting menu.
311392152871661600,Tue Mar 12 08:24:09 +0000 2013,@SavioCFC Actually, I don't. I love Bayern as well. I hate to admit it but I'm hoping to see the Bayern magic against us. Its been a while.
311390057263157250,Tue Mar 12 08:15:49 +0000 2013,@SavioCFC Its something I live with.
311369001487978500,Tue Mar 12 06:52:09 +0000 2013,@SavioCFC Sorry! Terrible memory!

311188578585694200,Mon Mar 11 18:55:13 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass That too. How eventful is your life robbie?
311187196411514900,Mon Mar 11 18:49:43 +0000 2013,@SavioCFC Lol. Well, alright. Do I know you btw?
311187090345971700,Mon Mar 11 18:49:18 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Lol. That's one topic that can't be discussed on twitter. Too much passion involved. Yes, it was extremely frustrating.
310658743719325700,Sun Mar 10 07:49:50 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass I'd like to hear them sometime anyway. :)
310658444912910340,Sun Mar 10 07:48:39 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Wtf! This is madness! What happened to creativity?
310657806682435600,Sun Mar 10 07:46:07 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Hahahahahahahahaha. Atleast one of us does!
310657669994266600,Sun Mar 10 07:45:34 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Don't ask! I'm now thinking about shit on sunday. I shall tell you tomo.

310657146775797760,Sun Mar 10 07:43:30 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Why not then! Except 90% of the people who are entrepreneurs now, won't remain so for very long. Circle of life.
310656317750640640,Sun Mar 10 07:40:12 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Well, I work for a travel company. Like any other job in the world, its boring.
310656099663626240,Sun Mar 10 07:39:20 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Hahahahahahahahaha. Well, you should do something to shut them up then. Doesn't necessarily have to be flying.
310655652177518600,Sun Mar 10 07:37:33 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Manish Mehtani's from Dehradoon. He's been playing for mohun bagan for the past 4 years now. Was on the Indian squad too.
310654734992298000,Sun Mar 10 07:33:55 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Tell me about it. My work life isn't the best at the moment either.
310654633238478850,Sun Mar 10 07:33:30 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Its one of his best. Love the lyrics!

310652333937791000,Sun Mar 10 07:24:22 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Hmmm. I'm not that big a fan of blues. More of alternative, country, rock. No metal.
310651715097591800,Sun Mar 10 07:21:55 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Bah. What about charters? Any luck with those?
310651391754522600,Sun Mar 10 07:20:38 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Hmmm. How old are you again?
310650267823665150,Sun Mar 10 07:16:10 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass What kinda music do you play?
310650192619773950,Sun Mar 10 07:15:52 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Its been a bad bad time for the aviation industry. Do you fly?
310649820509524000,Sun Mar 10 07:14:23 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Ahaan. Fair enough! Who cares where its from as long as their's money in one's pocket!
310648866343120900,Sun Mar 10 07:10:35 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Ahaan. Avaiation enthusiast..eeh? What do you do for a living? Btw how can you be a fail guitarist if you can play Bm, A, G, D?
310645500904894460,Sun Mar 10 06:57:13 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Oh yes. What do you do otherwise?
310644334112423940,Sun Mar 10 06:52:35 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Oh come on! It would have been equally awesome if I had been a kabaddi player or wrestler!
310644046152486900,Sun Mar 10 06:51:26 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Lol. You crack me up!
310642495224676350,Sun Mar 10 06:45:16 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Well, I just kept playing.
310642333773332500,Sun Mar 10 06:44:38 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Hahahahahahahahaha! He did! But I really like Puyol otherwise. The guy can really take hits.
310641179207295000,Sun Mar 10 06:40:03 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass LMAO. Crazy shit!
310640441378865150,Sun Mar 10 06:37:07 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Ahaan. But I did kick ass. :p The thing is I used to train with the boys when I was a kid, and then with a men's a div club. :)
310640088331739140,Sun Mar 10 06:35:43 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Dude, the madrid game was awesome! I was soo fucking happy! Remember Di Maria vs Puyol??
310638461705150460,Sun Mar 10 06:29:15 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass I'm sure neither would I have if I had been a guy. :p But yes, I mostly played either as a striker or on the wings.
310638255487975400,Sun Mar 10 06:28:26 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass LOL. You really do hate them! But I couldn't agree with you more. They are cry babies.
310637422834757600,Sun Mar 10 06:25:07 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Sometime's I think I should be hot in demand. I not only understand the offside rule, I was awesome at breaking offside traps :p
310636321628635140,Sun Mar 10 06:20:45 +0000 2013,@I_mTheBatman Ummm. I'm not. Speak for yourself!
310636256293961700,Sun Mar 10 06:20:29 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Lol. I was kidding about that. Not that awesome.
310636016543334400,Sun Mar 10 06:19:32 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Utd play some good football. Love their fighting spirit, the fact that they play to win. But their attitude is unsportsmanly.
310635435976167400,Sun Mar 10 06:17:13 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass Woah. I wish I could say the same. Football goes way back for me too. But my memory's terrible. Don't remember shit.
310632912557060100,Sun Mar 10 06:07:12 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass LOL. It was a long time back. Anyhow, it isn't my USP. My awesomeness is. :p

310631313587724300,Sun Mar 10 06:00:51 +0000 2013,@lobbedpass That's alright. More tolerable than the MoFo Utd fan club any day.

310289460292116500,Sat Mar 09 07:22:26 +0000 2013,@OjChi @Arunfoot Aree, its not about acing the 2nd div. They are spending more on players than many 1st div clubs. Expecting better quality.
310288769234374660,Sat Mar 09 07:19:42 +0000 2013,@ronu_b Always a charmer Randeep :) Though, my opinions tend to interfere.

241775547401785340,Sat Sep 01 05:52:37 +0000 2012,@abir17in Now the combination of Sean Rooney and Angel is what I am interested in. I am looking forward to watch Salgaocar play.
