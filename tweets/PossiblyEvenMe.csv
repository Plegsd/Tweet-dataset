1246616987238903800,Sun Apr 05 01:53:45 +0000 2020,Doug just reverse psychologied her into the move. That's some real Mystery shit.

1246614316025090000,Sun Apr 05 01:43:08 +0000 2020,Okay, but how the hell do they go to the Olympics as their second EVER competition?
1246614008758775800,Sun Apr 05 01:41:55 +0000 2020,Or as Doug said, "horseshit."
1246613926063849500,Sun Apr 05 01:41:35 +0000 2020,Ice skating judging is such a racket.

1246604302023524400,Sun Apr 05 01:03:21 +0000 2020,I feel like if Doug wants to master figure skates, he should lay off hockey scrimmages and skating in his hockey skates.
