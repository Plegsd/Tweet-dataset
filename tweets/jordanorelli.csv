915610666358239200,Wed Oct 04 16:12:48 +0000 2017,so the app servers get to be stateless. but multiplayer servers are -also- state containers.
915610523546382300,Wed Oct 04 16:12:14 +0000 2017,a huge reason for that break is that database servers function as state containers. the state exists in the system in the database.
915610436489314300,Wed Oct 04 16:11:53 +0000 2017,how many times have you heard "this works great! except for with managing the database servers ..."

915610283921625100,Wed Oct 04 16:11:17 +0000 2017,a lot of the abstractions used in web server infra assume a stateless model, because http is stateless and the web is largely stateless.
