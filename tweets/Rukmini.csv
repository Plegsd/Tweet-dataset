875598410681679900,Fri Jun 16 06:18:23 +0000 2017,Just thought this is something lawyers and those interested in women's access to justice might want to brainstorm about a bit. Thanks (ends)
875598149754036200,Fri Jun 16 06:17:21 +0000 2017,We have a serious legal gap for anyone who isn't reporting crime immediately, and for child sexual abuse that is often impossible.
875597518364491800,Fri Jun 16 06:14:50 +0000 2017,If these cases got to court, they would come up against the "why the delay" q. But it is appalling that they cannot even make it to court.
875597267436044300,Fri Jun 16 06:13:51 +0000 2017,So here we are, where a woman who wants to report rape (by today's definitions) that took place 5 years cannot find a single applicable law.
875596930407047200,Fri Jun 16 06:12:30 +0000 2017,Where the statute of limitations does kick in is for IPC 354 (molestation) prior to 2013.
875596623216234500,Fri Jun 16 06:11:17 +0000 2017,Additionally, the definition of rape was broadened only by the 2013 amendment to 376, so those changes do not apply retrospectively either.
875596419477917700,Fri Jun 16 06:10:28 +0000 2017,This despite the fact that the statute of limitations does not apply to POCSO.
875596281216811000,Fri Jun 16 06:09:55 +0000 2017,Since POCSO was passed only in 2012 and does not apply retrospectively, a woman today reporting abuse even five years ago is stuck.
