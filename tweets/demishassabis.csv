709583319973802000,Tue Mar 15 03:33:41 +0000 2016,Game 5 starting in 30 mins: going to be really exciting to see if Lee Sedol can exploit the weakness in #AlphaGo‚Äôs play he found in game 4
709583014926245900,Tue Mar 15 03:32:28 +0000 2016,The neural nets were trained through self-play so there will be gaps in their knowledge, which is why we are here: to test AlphaGo the limit
709582557843591200,Tue Mar 15 03:30:39 +0000 2016,This meant that all the prior searching #AlphaGo had done was rendered useless, and for a while it misevaluated the highly complex position
709582135363903500,Tue Mar 15 03:28:59 +0000 2016,Taken a quick look at the logs: AlphaGo gave a probability of &lt;1 in 10000 for Lee's brilliant move 78, so AG found this move very surprising

708934687926804500,Sun Mar 13 08:36:15 +0000 2016,When I say 'thought' and 'realisation' I just mean the output of #AlphaGo value net. It was around 70% at move 79 and then dived on move 87
708928006400581600,Sun Mar 13 08:09:42 +0000 2016,Mistake was on move 79, but #AlphaGo only came to that realisation on around move 87
