655508065920249900,Sat Oct 17 22:17:56 +0000 2015,@uriahz sounds like we need to invest in training them for jobs that can support higher wages.
655507692446859300,Sat Oct 17 22:16:27 +0000 2015,@uriahz in a W2 Uber, anyone who can't make good money today will not do better. These people need better options &amp; have bigger problems.
655507303395754000,Sat Oct 17 22:14:54 +0000 2015,@uriahz I don't see your point. They are free to decide how to spend their time.
655506385120063500,Sat Oct 17 22:11:15 +0000 2015,@uriahz it would be McDonald's.

655506003794899000,Sat Oct 17 22:09:44 +0000 2015,@uriahz in a W2 model, they need permission to even try. And remember, none of them will be FT, so it's not like it becomes a great job.
655505768590905300,Sat Oct 17 22:08:48 +0000 2015,@uriahz that doesn't happen. Drivers aren't stupid. If they can't make money they do something else.

655501622563332100,Sat Oct 17 21:52:20 +0000 2015,@uriahz their margins are excellent. This would mostly be bad for consumers by limiting the service to areas that can support higher costs.
655500336044486700,Sat Oct 17 21:47:13 +0000 2015,@uriahz that actually is fine for uber. short-term and entrenches their lead. Long-term there are no humans in the model.

652992669526847500,Sat Oct 10 23:42:39 +0000 2015,@adam_hurwitz how so?
652990081192427500,Sat Oct 10 23:32:21 +0000 2015,@EricFriedman apparently my ability to persuade is poor. Even uncontested it's 50/50.
652985015454699500,Sat Oct 10 23:12:14 +0000 2015,@YangTerrence listen to that podcast.
652980303200305200,Sat Oct 10 22:53:30 +0000 2015,@fmbutt it's nothing like Yahoo, other than that it's struggling.
652980097415188500,Sat Oct 10 22:52:41 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart disagree. Should be same as Twitter user. It's all brand ads against interests. Scales with total audience size.
652979165700816900,Sat Oct 10 22:48:59 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart today it's a content feature in a social product w network effects. It's like social was bolted on.
652978928496197600,Sat Oct 10 22:48:02 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart I wouldn't be surprised to see them layer in social features, but that would be easier outside a social app.
652978639919710200,Sat Oct 10 22:46:54 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart Some, definitely. And could be true of Moments too. Direct all new or low-engagement users there until.
652978352479858700,Sat Oct 10 22:45:45 +0000 2015,@SG we will see.
652977956084539400,Sat Oct 10 22:44:11 +0000 2015,@conradowen if I knew that, I'd be over there working on it. Likely slowly. But again, it doesn't matter for company success.
652977680111898600,Sat Oct 10 22:43:05 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart but Vine and Periscope have been doing well. Past success proves possibilities, past failures matter, but prove nothing.
652977369414660100,Sat Oct 10 22:41:51 +0000 2015,@amotion we agreed never to speak of that again. Also, Twitter Music sucked.

652976903159091200,Sat Oct 10 22:40:00 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart I don't think that's the problem. Easy for them to push traffic from Twitter, get featured in app stores, etc.
652976073055952900,Sat Oct 10 22:36:42 +0000 2015,@paulbaumgart isn't the whole point that they need growth, not more engagement. Overlap is just increased engagement.
652975598818586600,Sat Oct 10 22:34:49 +0000 2015,@zanes then why is there no growth? Is it really a churn problem? That would be counter to all I've heard.

652946582438965200,Sat Oct 10 20:39:31 +0000 2015,@natisho what data supports that position? My understanding is the opposite.
652937069707178000,Sat Oct 10 20:01:43 +0000 2015,@YangTerrence it may prime you for brand ads, like TV, and likely discourages commerce. Buying distracts from the content you like.
652936819705643000,Sat Oct 10 20:00:43 +0000 2015,@YangTerrence social is not optimal for commerce. It's about your mental mode &amp; context while using. It's a top of funnel context.
652936625962414100,Sat Oct 10 19:59:57 +0000 2015,@YangTerrence look at FB revenue. Almost none of it comes from commerce and they've been trying for years.
652936472647962600,Sat Oct 10 19:59:20 +0000 2015,@jkuiaski @_benng but disturbing that you can get so far without really understanding loose coupling &amp; high cohesion.

652925834718646300,Sat Oct 10 19:17:04 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli if that could be measured, that would be better, but if it can't, this ratio will remain. There will always be top of funnel.
652925626060410900,Sat Oct 10 19:16:14 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli the vast majority of add dollars are spent on things that can't be directly measured. Brand advertising.
652925446317731800,Sat Oct 10 19:15:31 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli we seem to disagree on the facts of how people use different products (social v search). Not sure what to tell you.
652924675350138900,Sat Oct 10 19:12:28 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli Google works for this because the user is in search &amp; buy mode. The positive is that there are way more brand dollars.
652924454222204900,Sat Oct 10 19:11:35 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli the opposite is true. You're not in a mode to buy stuff when fucking around on Twitter. It can happen, but medium discourages
652920468014403600,Sat Oct 10 18:55:44 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli check out the latest @exponentfm for arguments against. Social is optimal for brand advertising.
652919658358505500,Sat Oct 10 18:52:31 +0000 2015,@arielmichaeli it's not clear they can make money at it. Look at Facebook's numbers.

652902383819751400,Sat Oct 10 17:43:53 +0000 2015,@artypapers very true. IMO, the latter is the real problem. Always has been. Props to them for the hard decision to purge.
652901801692299300,Sat Oct 10 17:41:34 +0000 2015,@trengriffin network effects is a means to an end. The end is still aggregating audience for advertisers.
652900486882832400,Sat Oct 10 17:36:21 +0000 2015,@JoshConstine the hard problem is getting them in in the first place. I don't see a strategy there.
652900073618038800,Sat Oct 10 17:34:42 +0000 2015,It's important to understand that a) Twitter is sub-scale, &amp; b) a user in any app counts towards scale. See FB. https://t.co/AvkTvT6gd5
652899565725597700,Sat Oct 10 17:32:41 +0000 2015,@artypapers of course the question is, what's the valuable problem to solve? All things equal, take the easy way.
652899305624244200,Sat Oct 10 17:31:39 +0000 2015,@artypapers that point was that pointing to failed standalone social apps and saying Moments can't survive is wrong.
652898778869985300,Sat Oct 10 17:29:33 +0000 2015,@jyarow sure, that's exactly what I meant.

652893841133973500,Sat Oct 10 17:09:56 +0000 2015,2/ Moments is an acknowledgment that core growth won't continue. FB &amp; Google are addressing the same issue with Internet drones/balloons.

652890862041468900,Sat Oct 10 16:58:06 +0000 2015,@troutgirl basically, it's pretty news. Not really social. A lot like Moments.
652890373040160800,Sat Oct 10 16:56:09 +0000 2015,@trengriffin can do with prominent App Store placement &amp; global marketing reach. Since it's not social, you don't need existing users in.
652890006864855000,Sat Oct 10 16:54:42 +0000 2015,@troutgirl Flipboard then?
652889791428587500,Sat Oct 10 16:53:51 +0000 2015,@TheRomit there's no leverage from users. It isn't social. Content matters. They have that either way.
652889607965544400,Sat Oct 10 16:53:07 +0000 2015,Moments isn't a social app. It isn't Poke &amp; other failures, or even Vine (kinda working, surprisingly), it's Circa. Much easier problem.

652886561881591800,Sat Oct 10 16:41:01 +0000 2015,@mikiyas_t @arielmichaeli it's not a hypothetical market, but even so, it all comes down to expected ROI adjusted for risk.
652885522965098500,Sat Oct 10 16:36:53 +0000 2015,4/ What I don't get is why Moments is not a stripped down standalone app; a gateway drug. Twitter for people who don't like Twitter.
652885109020889100,Sat Oct 10 16:35:14 +0000 2015,3/ But Twitter has a brand problem. Too many know it, and don't think it's for them. How do you even get inactive people to log back in?
652884944365051900,Sat Oct 10 16:34:35 +0000 2015,2/ It's obvious Moments is targeted at new/inactive non-power users. It seems like it'll eventually be pretty awesome for that.

652879025128341500,Sat Oct 10 16:11:04 +0000 2015,@mikiyas_t @arielmichaeli well the people who gave them $7M are known for being idiots &amp; never turn $7M into $700M. Probably good to assume.

645319203818369000,Sat Sep 19 19:31:02 +0000 2015,@MikeIsaac the @exponentfm had a great discussion of that, and some great @benthompson self-analysis as well. Worth a listen.
645318796811485200,Sat Sep 19 19:29:25 +0000 2015,@MikeIsaac they are few and far between. Amazon is the biggest example.
645318486764335100,Sat Sep 19 19:28:11 +0000 2015,6/ Perks are a crutch. Great leaders compete by offering challenges, cultures, and missions. And they always get the best people.
645318173231726600,Sat Sep 19 19:26:56 +0000 2015,5/ Perks say, "we've made it," which is wrong. Mentality should be: we're making it, &amp; it's a decent v0.1. Go, go, go‚Ä¶
645317947913732100,Sat Sep 19 19:26:02 +0000 2015,4/ Free lunch isn't free. Resting your thinking muscle (exercise, etc) matters. The lock-em-in mentality is compensation for bad management.
645317396652126200,Sat Sep 19 19:23:51 +0000 2015,3/ While many perks are relatively cheap, fancy offices are the perk that breaks the bank &amp; sends the worst signal.
645317206159458300,Sat Sep 19 19:23:06 +0000 2015,2/ Entitled candidates will self-select out, and hiring conversations will focus on mission and values. You'll hire better people.
