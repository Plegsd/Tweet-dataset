486205788717715460,Mon Jul 07 17:51:07 +0000 2014,@JimDuncan @rqd Sorry to hear that. Did you file a support request? I‚Äôd love to find out what the issue was so we can fix it and win u back.
486203165788733440,Mon Jul 07 17:40:42 +0000 2014,Great moments in terrible customer service: @DesignByIKEA - Order stuff online, but you need to call them on the phone to check status.
485977688167821300,Mon Jul 07 02:44:44 +0000 2014,Just used our @googledrive integration in Acompli to review our press release about our @googledrive &amp; @dropbox integration. How meta.

484408636496568300,Wed Jul 02 18:49:53 +0000 2014,@dwr that said, freeing clients from the limitations of POP/IMAP/EAS makes for a much more powerful email experience. Lots of potential.
484408243351846900,Wed Jul 02 18:48:19 +0000 2014,@dwr great question. Short answer: email clients are hard to build, &amp; before you can do a proprietary side you have to do the open side.

484091499903074300,Tue Jul 01 21:49:42 +0000 2014,Right, because the best thing that could happen here is for us to go to a penalty shootout. Like Howard hasn‚Äôt done enough already.
484078153896173600,Tue Jul 01 20:56:40 +0000 2014,Just got a Twitter alert indicating that @hunterwalk is talking about the World Cup on Twitter. Not sure that was news, but hey, why not?
484050366506344450,Tue Jul 01 19:06:15 +0000 2014,@stshank I think it‚Äôs part of @nytimes paywall strategy. They count how many articles you‚Äôve read so they can restrict views for paid users.
484037886413516800,Tue Jul 01 18:16:39 +0000 2014,Muchas gracias @UnivisionSports por la cobertura espectacular del mundial. Cuando otros fallan, ustedes siguen sin problemas. Excelente.

482697201471082500,Sat Jun 28 01:29:15 +0000 2014,After careful consideration, I'd give @phish's new album Fuego a 8.5/10. Billy Breathes is a better 'album' but this is pretty solid.
