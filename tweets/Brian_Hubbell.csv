10181346461,Mon Mar 08 18:07:39 +0000 2010,I think these are the things Silvernail and MEPRI could be studying.  What can #MEschools learn from Cherryfield?
10181229429,Mon Mar 08 18:04:28 +0000 2010,Cherryfield's own SAD voted to close their school. Would the kids' prospects be improved were they  administered from Ellsworth or Machias?
10180975375,Mon Mar 08 17:57:55 +0000 2010,With only 84 kids, Cherryfield probably has one of the lowest teacher-pupil ratios among #MEschools.  How would doubling this ratio affect?
10180883982,Mon Mar 08 17:55:27 +0000 2010,Good case study would be Cherryfield Elementary. It's one of the top K-8 #MEschools yet from one of the poorest regions. Why?
10179818945,Mon Mar 08 17:27:35 +0000 2010,@deviger Silvernail would agree. For years they've quibbled over performance metrics and never moved further into case studies.  #MEschools
10179510829,Mon Mar 08 17:19:30 +0000 2010,With the inaccurate ratio, one more timber is removed from the EPS platform, serving as both policy floor and spending ceiling. #MEschools
10178911936,Mon Mar 08 17:04:16 +0000 2010,But Committee is spooked away from reducing teacher ratio because, raising EPS cost of education could also increase req'd local mil rate.
10178798622,Mon Mar 08 17:01:28 +0000 2010,Altering EPS teacher-student ratio from 15 to 13 would better reflect #MEschools.practice but of course won't boost curtailed subsidy.
