701489692953301000,Sun Feb 21 19:32:30 +0000 2016,@VinnyLingham not true. It's also b/c founders are increasingly lazy and don't want to consider things from 1st principles. Also product sux
701489096393248800,Sun Feb 21 19:30:08 +0000 2016,@guyfriedman No. It was because they gushed cash and could do it...all those people would have worked there regardless.

701487337780310000,Sun Feb 21 19:23:08 +0000 2016,@owenthomas No free food at Apple. People like to work at winning companies. Even when the food costs money. All else is window dressing.

701484580138659800,Sun Feb 21 19:12:11 +0000 2016,6/ I place immense blame on the lack of real VCs, Angels and incubators b/c very few have any real, useful experience to help guide founders

700948352330920000,Sat Feb 20 07:41:24 +0000 2016,7/ No excuse for not managing burn, spending on whats crucial and finding a viable business model asap.
700948121723891700,Sat Feb 20 07:40:29 +0000 2016,6/ Today's CEOs need to internalize this reality and stop falling for the hype cycle of raise $, spend$, fake growth, raise, spend repeat.
700947867175776300,Sat Feb 20 07:39:29 +0000 2016,5/ But none of these companies relied on ongoing private mkts to fund their expansion or search for profitability.  They found it early on.
700947670253187100,Sat Feb 20 07:38:42 +0000 2016,4/ $AMZN is another example who takes it to the extreme.  Sinks every profit dollar into expanding their moat.
700947394922328000,Sat Feb 20 07:37:36 +0000 2016,3/ These companies gush money into all kinds of things.  But their core business was profitable early on and could feed these other bets.
700947024632373200,Sat Feb 20 07:36:08 +0000 2016,2/ The idea that the path to a massive outcome is massive losses before massive profits is misguided.  People are making up history.

700728893322371100,Fri Feb 19 17:09:21 +0000 2016,5/ Those companies will have a difficult time. Even if they can raise more private money, there isn't a receptive public market for them...
