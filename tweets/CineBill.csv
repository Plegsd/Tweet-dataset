19620696095,Tue Jul 27 02:09:11 +0000 2010,@npdop None yet, but I'll probably get 4 of the 140 that are Nm-Hi & the 4x charger.  No lithium grenades for me!

19552711945,Mon Jul 26 06:17:12 +0000 2010,@Rocket_Scott They are nice, and lightweight, but for my $, I get more bang per $ by building my own block batts.
19552644645,Mon Jul 26 06:15:46 +0000 2010,@npdop yes, that is one way to go, but big $$$$!
19538221860,Mon Jul 26 02:08:21 +0000 2010,@npdop I think ultimately, block batts are going to be best & use onboard only when necessary: handheld, etc.
19510806726,Sun Jul 25 17:38:10 +0000 2010,@npdop I got the camera with a Gold Mount. More prevalent worldwide, and more reliable, says ARRI. Also use my 30v 435 batts. Cam max is 34v
