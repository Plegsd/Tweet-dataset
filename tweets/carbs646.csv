298054539788054500,Sun Feb 03 13:05:14 +0000 2013,@ChrisTremlett33 there's a lot more stand n deliver players as  oppose to guys who can bat two days??
298054157947007000,Sun Feb 03 13:03:43 +0000 2013,@ChrisTremlett33 slow pitches mean both bowlers and batsmen have to try things hence consistency may suffer in order to score or get wickets
298053646791348200,Sun Feb 03 13:01:41 +0000 2013,@ChrisTremlett33 I agree bro u need game changers in any team, but consistent run making is based on good defensive technique and patience
298051170818195460,Sun Feb 03 12:51:51 +0000 2013,@ChrisTremlett33 urrrrr good point man! Trouble is like we seeing now u don't see those hundreds anymore ?

298049436775501800,Sun Feb 03 12:44:57 +0000 2013,Valid point from @ChrisTremlett33 . Slow pitches allow more attacking batting. How many great centuries are scored pitches with life???

298046315584159740,Sun Feb 03 12:32:33 +0000 2013,@Goto919
298041410895101950,Sun Feb 03 12:13:04 +0000 2013,@Goto919 yea everyone is aware of results my man but it's the battles between bat and ball. That era produced better test matches
298037784827002900,Sun Feb 03 11:58:39 +0000 2013,@Goto919 disagree! Viv vs lillee and Thompson . Gavaskar vs West Indies quicks of 80s. Robin smith and Allan lamb vs West Indies in the 90s?
298037190091497500,Sun Feb 03 11:56:18 +0000 2013,@Mercian79 possibly yes! Which is sad. Nothing better than good batsmanship against high class bowling on a bouncy pitch.
