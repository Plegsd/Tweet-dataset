617024789195063300,Fri Jul 03 17:39:08 +0000 2015,7) The App Store is like the worst Top40 radio. Question for Apple: can it do for app developers what Beats1 promises to do for musicians?
617024261547364400,Fri Jul 03 17:37:02 +0000 2015,6) But listening to #Beats1 this morning, I couldn‚Äôt help but think of the sorry state of iOS indie app developers. http://t.co/QXaAQiAUWj
617024071767691300,Fri Jul 03 17:36:17 +0000 2015,5) It will be fascinating to track the impact on the careers of the musicians #Beats1 features.
617023749053792300,Fri Jul 03 17:35:00 +0000 2015,4) Given the installed base it will surely be the largest &amp; most influential radio station in the world. That has to be good news for music.
617023375764951000,Fri Jul 03 17:33:31 +0000 2015,3) It‚Äôs kind of amazing that Apple gave its flagship radio product the playlist of a great college station.
617023270068420600,Fri Jul 03 17:33:05 +0000 2015,2)  Classic hip-hop with new indie rock, pulsating EDM, obscure Radiohead songs, alt-speed-metal, sounds that I don‚Äôt have categories for.
617023053533282300,Fri Jul 03 17:32:14 +0000 2015,1) #Beats1 is so much better &amp; more significant than I'd imagined: completely indifferent to existing Top40 hits &amp; traditional radio genres.
