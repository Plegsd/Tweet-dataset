359029139535183900,Sun Jul 21 19:16:31 +0000 2013,@sadialatifi... Said nothing about that.  It's the magazine cover on which its placed.  Don't see many "normal kids" on the cover of RS.
359025185426378750,Sun Jul 21 19:00:49 +0000 2013,@sadialatifi... That's one way to look at it.  The other is that it makes him anything but a "normal kid".  It makes him look like a star.
359016238153859100,Sun Jul 21 18:25:16 +0000 2013,@sadialatifi... A story that explores how a kid can be turned into a terrorist is one thing.  Putting him on the cover is very different.
