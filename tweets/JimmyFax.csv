5306548964,Sat Oct 31 03:59:24 +0000 2009,now that C-Lee is NOT pitching on short rest, Girardi is going to need to really step it up to make the worst decision of this series
5306509731,Sat Oct 31 03:57:11 +0000 2009,@Mikefaxon agreed

5036638042,Wed Oct 21 04:19:25 +0000 2009,@Mikefaxon i kind of agree with you, but let's not count our chickens before they hatch (i think that's the first time I've ever said that).

4487295279,Wed Sep 30 02:29:24 +0000 2009,JUAN MIRANDA!!!!  Unlike the Sox, it's like the Yanks CANNOT lose!!!
4487020994,Wed Sep 30 02:17:40 +0000 2009,5 run rally is not enough for the Sox.  I love that they're shitting their way into October.

3928124129,Sat Sep 12 04:27:35 +0000 2009,Seriously, I think I just saw Jimmy McNulty outside my hotel.  It's not a bad place, but the location leaves a little to be desired.
3928093726,Sat Sep 12 04:25:35 +0000 2009,Has never seen so many hookers in such a short period of time.  Helllloooooo Baltimore.

3916467623,Fri Sep 11 18:20:10 +0000 2009,watching Mike Jordan giving interviews about the hall of fame inductions today is kind of sad
3916455737,Fri Sep 11 18:19:33 +0000 2009,@Jordan5L  yeah, i must have switched it back at some point I don't remember.  Whatever, Breaston will get me back.
3915998376,Fri Sep 11 17:55:44 +0000 2009,Shitfuck, I watched the game last night thinking I started Gage and then found out later I didn't. Daaamn, Breaston better have a good week.
3894336554,Thu Sep 10 19:38:29 +0000 2009,@Jordan5L You know the Twitter names of all your fantasy players?  I am astonished you have both a girlfriend and a job.

3725998960,Thu Sep 03 03:13:19 +0000 2009,never thought Carmelo Anthony could produce a documentary that would make me feel empathy for Mike Tyson, but that seems to be happening.
3661163023,Mon Aug 31 06:40:50 +0000 2009,...would I prefer good Scott Kazmir to be on the Rays or the Angels?  As a #NYY fan, I cannot answer that question.
3661156171,Mon Aug 31 06:40:10 +0000 2009,Not sure what to think of the Kazmir trade, used to think he was dominant, but not so much this year, and even if he was...
3646977733,Sun Aug 30 16:01:26 +0000 2009,#Giants Hakeem Nicks... Looking Frisky... I already love him as a Giants fan, but worth taking late in #FantasyFootball?
3639172911,Sun Aug 30 04:13:19 +0000 2009,just learned there is both a tropical storm and hot latin pop star named Jimena and I'm not sure what to think about that.
3586443490,Thu Aug 27 20:00:22 +0000 2009,Phil effing coke.  Is this guy serious?  I want him taken out and shot. ERA now over 5, so people need to stop telling me I'm overreacting.
3584003868,Thu Aug 27 17:52:35 +0000 2009,Mariano Rivera has a positive VORP as a hitter this year.  I love BP for letting me know things like this.

3519339438,Mon Aug 24 20:01:03 +0000 2009,and that is giving a lot of juice to the new stadium, I don't think the boys are very good this year.
3519328008,Mon Aug 24 20:00:28 +0000 2009,I mean, they have a GOOD chance at starting 6-0 with the only big challenge there being the new stadium opener in Dallas.
3519326854,Mon Aug 24 20:00:25 +0000 2009,just went over the Giants' schedule. I honestly think they'll probably go 12-4.
3434959555,Thu Aug 20 20:40:55 +0000 2009,Just checked, since Mid-May, the Bombers are 15-10 against teams that have a  shot at making the playoffs in the AL (TEX, BOX, LAA, TB, DET)

3394887152,Wed Aug 19 00:51:23 +0000 2009,that was in terms of the #1 overall pick in #fantasyfootball, but in reality, I'd probably still puss out and take All Day.
3394874053,Wed Aug 19 00:50:43 +0000 2009,@boarsheadrob ok, i agree with that.  I'd take Turner if it's not PPR, Forte if it is. Berrian's value is up too, since INTs don't hurt him.
3386416562,Tue Aug 18 17:24:03 +0000 2009,oh wait, no i'm not because Favre is a HORRIBLE NFL Quarterback at this stage of his career.  I wouldn't draft him with Bea Arthur's dick.
3386378350,Tue Aug 18 17:22:01 +0000 2009,Is disappointed he already had one fantasy draft before finding out that Bret Favre was coming back.
3300362521,Fri Aug 14 03:15:11 +0000 2009,Fantastic, now I can hate the Eagles more

2624598742,Tue Jul 14 01:42:15 +0000 2009,Even if Pujols hits two more, I'm a little disenchanted.  I thought he could put up double digits hitting with his Fat Albert. #hrderby
