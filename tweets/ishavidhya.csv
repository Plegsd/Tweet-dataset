654937612461871100,Fri Oct 16 08:31:09 +0000 2015,We need to change with time. We need to support the work of NGOs providing the service that temples &amp; mosques used to provide 200 yrs ago.
654937276514893800,Fri Oct 16 08:29:49 +0000 2015,But times have changed. Temples &amp; mosques are no longer able to create &amp; run needed social facilities. Govt&amp;NGOs are doing their work now &gt;&gt;
654936716655005700,Fri Oct 16 08:27:36 +0000 2015,By donating to temples &amp; mosques, each person supported schools,medical centres,orphanages &amp; even rest houses according to their capacity &gt;&gt;
654936161601753100,Fri Oct 16 08:25:23 +0000 2015,The reason for the tradition of donating in temples &amp; mosques is quite simple. They ran social facilities like orphanage, schools etc. &gt;&gt;
654935751327481900,Fri Oct 16 08:23:45 +0000 2015,We Indian donate, infact donate a lot but in temples or mosques or gurudwaras.   We are used to donating in such places. &gt;&gt;
