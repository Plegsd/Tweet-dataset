785653175344783400,Tue Oct 11 01:28:08 +0000 2016,@Kenny_Fry You might like Daring Greatly. I write a lot about vulnerability without boundaries is not vulnerability.
785644898334576600,Tue Oct 11 00:55:14 +0000 2016,@Kenny_Fry Interestingly, people are yearning to have the conversation. We’re afraid but I think we know it’s the path.

784599677060673500,Sat Oct 08 03:41:54 +0000 2016,@sandymaxey That’s exactly right. No filters, no nuance, no critical thinking. Just rage and fear. It’s dangerous.
784598906479009800,Sat Oct 08 03:38:51 +0000 2016,@sandymaxey I'm ok. It's not ok. People are in fear. We're dangerous in fear.

784550608992862200,Sat Oct 08 00:26:56 +0000 2016,To dismiss Trump’s comments as “guy talk” is an insult to good men and boys. This is what rape culture looks &amp; sounds like.
