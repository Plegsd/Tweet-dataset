621729031709311000,Thu Jul 16 17:12:06 +0000 2015,@thesillysully @google not on global search but fb should have no problem indexing its own video into open graph
621728602355183600,Thu Jul 16 17:10:24 +0000 2015,@fabrice_s doesn't matter. what matters is reach, engagement, and targeted audience
621728399782887400,Thu Jul 16 17:09:36 +0000 2015,@oliverjudge yes, same rev split terms as yt. See this by @KurtWagner8 http://t.co/rAikrZY5QY
621728249488412700,Thu Jul 16 17:09:00 +0000 2015,@thesillysully it's coming, no doubt about it. What's wrong w/ 3 sec views? that's a LONG time in a feed when you can scroll away.
621728100473135100,Thu Jul 16 17:08:24 +0000 2015,@thesillysully seems like an easy fix for them, but serendipitous discovery far more powerful/important
621727978527916000,Thu Jul 16 17:07:55 +0000 2015,@thesillysully well u said millennials in your piece!
621727807253512200,Thu Jul 16 17:07:15 +0000 2015,@pkafka I've seen that to be true far more often on FB than on YT.
621725905786810400,Thu Jul 16 16:59:41 +0000 2015,@thesillysully and finally, 3 second views is a red herring. YT inevitably moving to autoplay and FB give producers better distro control.
621725742762606600,Thu Jul 16 16:59:02 +0000 2015,@thesillysully also re: search, since FB is really about a serendipitous discovery mode, not "search and find"
621725493088288800,Thu Jul 16 16:58:03 +0000 2015,@fabrice_s it's a stupid and arbitrary idea. you can correct for real views while still counting them in real time.
621725387932872700,Thu Jul 16 16:57:38 +0000 2015,@oliverjudge well it's up to the producer. you can just promote your back catelog
621725271993888800,Thu Jul 16 16:57:10 +0000 2015,@pkafka or just index videos and return in search. seems like a simple fix for a minor use case
621725144818389000,Thu Jul 16 16:56:40 +0000 2015,@mattsmacintosh like TV!
621725099415089200,Thu Jul 16 16:56:29 +0000 2015,@pkafka YT engineers subscribe to the "cult of the video ID." All content is equal in the eyes of the platform. Nice thought, bad biz.
621724787103039500,Thu Jul 16 16:55:14 +0000 2015,@thesillysully well first and foremost, demographics since FB has the most millennials of any platform
621724569380917200,Thu Jul 16 16:54:23 +0000 2015,@fabrice_s That's a weird YT product engineering quibble that seems completely pointless
621724413726056400,Thu Jul 16 16:53:45 +0000 2015,@pkafka seems obvious that the functionality would merge, YT gets more "discoverable" and FB adds search, no?
621723250205130800,Thu Jul 16 16:49:08 +0000 2015,7) and finally demographics: FB has the highest share of millennials of any platform and also, you know, everyone else.
621723051621625900,Thu Jul 16 16:48:21 +0000 2015,6) re: search, FB is about discovery when users are in "content consume mode". Totally different use paradigm than "seek and search mode".
621722796113002500,Thu Jul 16 16:47:20 +0000 2015,5) whereas YT is scattershot, random, and feels like pushing content into the void. feels unsophisticated when compared to FB re: distro.
621722691016327200,Thu Jul 16 16:46:55 +0000 2015,4)FB's method allows producers to insert content into people's feeds, programmers have control over their distro (who sees it and when).
621722445456674800,Thu Jul 16 16:45:56 +0000 2015,3) Argument is really about the different discovery mechanisms on each platform. FB vs YT
621722251176493000,Thu Jul 16 16:45:10 +0000 2015,2) YT will be inevitably moving to auto-playing video, likely first in mobile then to desktop. sign of the times and they have to compete
621721789693956100,Thu Jul 16 16:43:20 +0000 2015,1) Re: 3-second autoplay views YT'ers love to point to this to prove YT views somehow count for more than FB views but thats a red herring
621721227917312000,Thu Jul 16 16:41:06 +0000 2015,Some good stuff in this piece by @thesillysully but completely disagree about views, demo, and search http://t.co/HVGK09jSSf
