218313988012908540,Thu Jun 28 12:04:45 +0000 2012,@gnurpreet I think it's less about how Glassdoor has implemented it but more of the how apps that have a FB connect will now work.
218313508075487230,Thu Jun 28 12:02:51 +0000 2012,@gnurpreet So it feels like you're just adding an app on FB but what it does is creates an fb connect account for you. It's quite misleading
