799282961170329600,Thu Nov 17 16:08:02 +0000 2016,I have to say from a marketing standpoint the @Spectacles launch is genius. It keeps the product hype relevant and @Snap in the news.
799268049752727600,Thu Nov 17 15:08:47 +0000 2016,So there's definitely more than one machine since it's back in California. Surely they wouldn't go CA &gt; OK &gt; CA wit‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mcZxGCnlbF

798699482913251300,Wed Nov 16 01:29:30 +0000 2016,@RaceJohnson @TechCrunch Well it's just a runner-style game though not a full on game like Clash.
798695255956561900,Wed Nov 16 01:12:42 +0000 2016,@RaceJohnson @TechCrunch Doesn't seem that outrageous to me. Obviously $4.99 would be more appealing but it's Mario and it will sell.

797857232398393300,Sun Nov 13 17:42:42 +0000 2016,It's all about supply vs demand and @Snap nailed it with the @Spectacles. Now if only they would come to San Diego ü§î

797629560665714700,Sun Nov 13 02:38:01 +0000 2016,@ApplWatcher @Spectacles From a brand standpoint it's super smart. It drives demand and gets the word out. Makes people want it.

796389478688403500,Wed Nov 09 16:30:22 +0000 2016,@totalkharnage Our candidates aren't even decided by the popular vote. The electoral college decides it all.

796387335713587200,Wed Nov 09 16:21:51 +0000 2016,The problem isn't Trump, it was Hillary. People think she's dishonest and untrustworthy. Neither option was good. #Election2016

796021374133223400,Tue Nov 08 16:07:39 +0000 2016,@ApplWatcher I'm in a higher tax bracket meaning tax cuts so they would take less each check. I hate them both honestly though lol
796020934419234800,Tue Nov 08 16:05:54 +0000 2016,@ApplWatcher But I don't like him or think he's fit for presidency. And Hillary is super corrupt so either way it sucks...
