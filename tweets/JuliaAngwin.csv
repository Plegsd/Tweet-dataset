824284059878719500,Wed Jan 25 15:53:28 +0000 2017,4. For now, a workaround is for journos and sources to put each other in address books under fake names. But this is not a perfect fix.
824283945856598000,Wed Jan 25 15:53:01 +0000 2017,3. Signal encrypts your contacts locally - does not store them. But many people sync their contacts with work computers.
824283882484809700,Wed Jan 25 15:52:46 +0000 2017,2. Currently Signal does not allow users to message people not in their address books. Many sources don‚Äôt want to put a journalist in there.
