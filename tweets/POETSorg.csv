1189927787265757200,Thu Oct 31 15:31:06 +0000 2019,And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
1189927691748888600,Thu Oct 31 15:30:44 +0000 2019,And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
1189927607858532400,Thu Oct 31 15:30:24 +0000 2019,And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,

1189923156246577200,Thu Oct 31 15:12:42 +0000 2019,Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
1189922796559839200,Thu Oct 31 15:11:17 +0000 2019,She shall press, ah, nevermore!
1189922671523446800,Thu Oct 31 15:10:47 +0000 2019,But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
1189922595132575700,Thu Oct 31 15:10:29 +0000 2019,On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
1189922512693538800,Thu Oct 31 15:10:09 +0000 2019,This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
1189922361807720400,Thu Oct 31 15:09:33 +0000 2019,To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
1189922284506620000,Thu Oct 31 15:09:14 +0000 2019,This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
1189921775427227600,Thu Oct 31 15:07:13 +0000 2019,Meant in croaking "Nevermore."
1189921422757519400,Thu Oct 31 15:05:49 +0000 2019,What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
1189921305098936300,Thu Oct 31 15:05:21 +0000 2019,Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore‚Äî
1189921216431378400,Thu Oct 31 15:05:00 +0000 2019,Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
1189921048885637000,Thu Oct 31 15:04:20 +0000 2019,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
1189920983643234300,Thu Oct 31 15:04:04 +0000 2019,But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
1189919256378523600,Thu Oct 31 14:57:13 +0000 2019,Of 'Never‚Äînevermore.'"
1189919190553186300,Thu Oct 31 14:56:57 +0000 2019,Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
1189919131203715000,Thu Oct 31 14:56:43 +0000 2019,Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore‚Äî
1189919074115096600,Thu Oct 31 14:56:29 +0000 2019,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
1189918937854742500,Thu Oct 31 14:55:57 +0000 2019,"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and store
1189918885866291200,Thu Oct 31 14:55:44 +0000 2019,Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
1189918770053222400,Thu Oct 31 14:55:17 +0000 2019,Then the bird said "Nevermore."
1189918553727783000,Thu Oct 31 14:54:25 +0000 2019,On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
1189918474644136000,Thu Oct 31 14:54:06 +0000 2019,Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before‚Äî
1189918408583856000,Thu Oct 31 14:53:50 +0000 2019,Nothing further then he uttered‚Äînot a feather then he fluttered‚Äî
1189918338958446600,Thu Oct 31 14:53:34 +0000 2019,That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
1189918283773988900,Thu Oct 31 14:53:21 +0000 2019,But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
1189918198591819800,Thu Oct 31 14:53:00 +0000 2019,With such name as "Nevermore."
1189918147245154300,Thu Oct 31 14:52:48 +0000 2019,Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
1189918089875480600,Thu Oct 31 14:52:34 +0000 2019,Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door‚Äî
1189917988625035300,Thu Oct 31 14:52:10 +0000 2019,For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
1189917933117554700,Thu Oct 31 14:51:57 +0000 2019,Though its answer little meaning‚Äîlittle relevancy bore;
1189917854008848400,Thu Oct 31 14:51:38 +0000 2019,Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
1189917496926752800,Thu Oct 31 14:50:13 +0000 2019,Quoth the Raven "Nevermore."
1189917439062085600,Thu Oct 31 14:49:59 +0000 2019,Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"
1189917381734420500,Thu Oct 31 14:49:46 +0000 2019,Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore‚Äî
1189917322133328000,Thu Oct 31 14:49:31 +0000 2019,"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
1189917222627618800,Thu Oct 31 14:49:08 +0000 2019,By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
1189917005232722000,Thu Oct 31 14:48:16 +0000 2019,Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
1189915777794744300,Thu Oct 31 14:43:23 +0000 2019,Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
1189915728222273500,Thu Oct 31 14:43:11 +0000 2019,Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door‚Äî
1189915678196818000,Thu Oct 31 14:42:59 +0000 2019,But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door‚Äî
1189915518104457200,Thu Oct 31 14:42:21 +0000 2019,Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
1189915440044220400,Thu Oct 31 14:42:03 +0000 2019,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
1189915360574738400,Thu Oct 31 14:41:44 +0000 2019,Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
1189914530354278400,Thu Oct 31 14:38:26 +0000 2019,'Tis the wind and nothing more!"
1189914479271784400,Thu Oct 31 14:38:14 +0000 2019,Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;‚Äî

1189914376318390300,Thu Oct 31 14:37:49 +0000 2019,"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;
1189914286371561500,Thu Oct 31 14:37:28 +0000 2019,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
1189914241475715000,Thu Oct 31 14:37:17 +0000 2019,Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
1189913490875732000,Thu Oct 31 14:34:18 +0000 2019,Merely this and nothing more.
1189913445732356000,Thu Oct 31 14:34:07 +0000 2019,This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"‚Äî
1189913369278595000,Thu Oct 31 14:33:49 +0000 2019,And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"
1189913307316138000,Thu Oct 31 14:33:34 +0000 2019,But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
1189913267394756600,Thu Oct 31 14:33:25 +0000 2019,Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
