853102221394722800,Sat Apr 15 04:26:34 +0000 2017,@Laura_Guillon no I mean how hard they push it in the trailer leads me to believe that the movie itself will go in a different direction.
853092065042849800,Sat Apr 15 03:46:12 +0000 2017,@taytayhive nah unfortunately- a lot of the snoke ones are kinda hair brained.

853033303770767400,Fri Apr 14 23:52:42 +0000 2017,@_spideyboy the movies are obvious but the new ones they spend a ton of time on misdirection with the trailers. rewatch TfA trailers...
853033060261969900,Fri Apr 14 23:51:44 +0000 2017,@newflocks there are so many kenobi moments with her- that seems super possible.
853032749459841000,Fri Apr 14 23:50:30 +0000 2017,@Laura_Guillon I don't - that was referring to how they presented him in TFA trailers.

853032035945824300,Fri Apr 14 23:47:40 +0000 2017,@newflocks I feel like they have presented him dark since empire 😈 he's been angry for like 40 years.
853031313057632300,Fri Apr 14 23:44:48 +0000 2017,@starrygoth it means I don't think they're gonna spend much time on that island- trailer feels like a red herring to me.
853031104311312400,Fri Apr 14 23:43:58 +0000 2017,@newflocks I loved the palpatine family background for her but seems like a stretch-sky walker seems 2 obv but jj's fib about it makes me 🤔
853029282888667100,Fri Apr 14 23:36:44 +0000 2017,@PantherAS90 I don't think it was obv in trailer personally-feel like they pushed Finn as force sensitive &amp; Poe as  a pos traitor in trailer
853027195869995000,Fri Apr 14 23:28:26 +0000 2017,@hereisMUNA Jedi is also the plural of Jedi 🤔
853023620561485800,Fri Apr 14 23:14:14 +0000 2017,also Gray Jedi idea seems way too obvious from the trailer-more like Luke is like "no more Jedi" &amp; she's like "train me 🙏🏻" resolved in 3min

773053788047286300,Tue Sep 06 07:02:40 +0000 2016,@missbrittania it was a commercial flop compared to the previous 2 albums- I'm not sad about it-its special to a lot of people including me.
773043721268887600,Tue Sep 06 06:22:40 +0000 2016,@reichenbxch I mean more so that it was a commercial flop at the time compared to our two previous albums.
773042229455630300,Tue Sep 06 06:16:44 +0000 2016,@petewentz I know it was a flop but I like it. Maybe how people feel about that album- I'm just trying to process- it's weird.
773042000241098800,Tue Sep 06 06:15:49 +0000 2016,@petewentz the raw ideas are insane- but maybe preconceived notions about m. Night and the shift in cinema informed it too much like FAD
773041174407815200,Tue Sep 06 06:12:33 +0000 2016,I think "lady in the water" as a movie is pretty rad, like maybe it's more of a demo- not fully finished kinda like FAD- it's sweet tho.
