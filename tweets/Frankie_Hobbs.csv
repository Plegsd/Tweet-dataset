1058788032852226000,Sat Nov 03 18:28:33 +0000 2018,Mane gains a 3-yard advantage by being in an offside position. If that isn’t the rule then it certainly should be.
1058785991408918500,Sat Nov 03 18:20:26 +0000 2018,Bellerin and Torreira have been immaculate so far. Need to make all this pressure pay. Big second half coming up.
1058782295409221600,Sat Nov 03 18:05:45 +0000 2018,Lucas Torreira and Granit Xhaka are building quite the partnership in midfield. Giving us the base to really give this a go.
1058779794547056600,Sat Nov 03 17:55:48 +0000 2018,This is a cracking game of football. Both teams look excellent.
