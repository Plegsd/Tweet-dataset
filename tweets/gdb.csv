714281188764942300,Mon Mar 28 02:41:20 +0000 2016,@lacker Good question — data is a string (i.e. imagine doing this in an HTTP request).
714271774691582000,Mon Mar 28 02:03:56 +0000 2016,Ask Twitter: is `numpy.load(data, allow_pickle=False)` secure in the presence of potentially-malicious `data`?
713788184295911400,Sat Mar 26 18:02:19 +0000 2016,@klinse @AshtonJEaton Good idea. Only issue is that @darraghbuckley sets a pretty aggressive pace...
710192835560149000,Wed Mar 16 19:55:41 +0000 2016,@hadrienlepicier @open_ai Likely MIT. However, the most interesting stuff will be our research, not just the code!
710132583548321800,Wed Mar 16 15:56:16 +0000 2016,@sebnem Thanks for the suggestion! I'd like to soon spread the spirit through our work, rather than just words. Stay tuned...
708336267893678100,Fri Mar 11 16:58:21 +0000 2016,@JMW_KC @open_ai Congratulations :)!
707470151671799800,Wed Mar 09 07:36:42 +0000 2016,Congrats to AlphaGo and the DeepMind team! Pretty amazing accomplishment.
705583253374136300,Fri Mar 04 02:38:51 +0000 2016,@rcollins0618 @open_ai Don't worry, still here :). Good stuff coming, but not going to rush it.
702313180639264800,Wed Feb 24 02:04:45 +0000 2016,@beerwheeltravel No issue with it, but it's also not particularly innovative — would rather concentrate on advancing AI state of the art.
702307575275003900,Wed Feb 24 01:42:28 +0000 2016,Looking for a contractor to build a new tool. Should be fun (Go + AWS), take about a week, and result will be OSS. Email me: gdb@openai.com.

696536590676422700,Mon Feb 08 03:30:38 +0000 2016,@asynchio @open_ai We've started using k8s as our compute cluster framework, yep! Happy so far, but still kicking the tires. cc/ @vmcheung
696509075127869400,Mon Feb 08 01:41:18 +0000 2016,Watching new nodes self-bootstrap and join the Kubernetes worker pool in response to a utilization alarm. Never gets old.

691685158286704600,Mon Jan 25 18:12:47 +0000 2016,@resetbrian Yep, that's right.
691669306505973800,Mon Jan 25 17:09:47 +0000 2016,@resetbrian No longer work at Stripe, but when I wrote the post was a long-time Slack user and fan. I viewed it as complementary to email.
690225547968839700,Thu Jan 21 17:32:49 +0000 2016,@FrequentTweets We haven't released any code yet, but expect to have some open-source projects in the upcoming months.
690225339637706800,Thu Jan 21 17:31:59 +0000 2016,@FrequentTweets That's an unrelated (seemingly long-defunct) project also called OpenAI!
689561594808807400,Tue Jan 19 21:34:30 +0000 2016,That feeling when your Internet outage turns out to just be a DNS outage.
689183099570143200,Mon Jan 18 20:30:29 +0000 2016,It's less clear how to neatly apply that idea to string templating though. Seems like we'll be stuck in tradeoff space forever :(.
689182162319347700,Mon Jan 18 20:26:46 +0000 2016,Seems like the best approach is to use arbitrary code to generate your declarative graph (such as Tensorflow/Theano).
689181256093859800,Mon Jan 18 20:23:10 +0000 2016,Declarative DSLs like Puppet suffer from this phenomenon too. Often find yourself devising clever hacks to e.g. iterate a list.
689181108366217200,Mon Jan 18 20:22:35 +0000 2016,Templating without arbitrary code: a great idea in theory, but requires so many contortions in practice.
688886147045445600,Mon Jan 18 00:50:30 +0000 2016,Upgrading third-party dependencies. So much software I didn't have to write.
687709407103201300,Thu Jan 14 18:54:34 +0000 2016,Mutating global state is never fun. (On the other hand, punching holes through abstractions can be, depending on your inclinations.)
687708872312619000,Thu Jan 14 18:52:26 +0000 2016,Unfortunate consequence of Flask's `run` method: it creates a WSGI server in a local variable, so you can't get at the instance.
687707592957665300,Thu Jan 14 18:47:21 +0000 2016,Only way I found to make Flask support keepalive:  import BaseHTTPServer BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler.protocol_version = 'HTTP/1.1'
687479141042499600,Thu Jan 14 03:39:34 +0000 2016,@f2netsrl @open_ai Definitely not financing external projects in the near future — today we're internally-focused on research.

684810931654688800,Wed Jan 06 18:57:03 +0000 2016,@AmarnathRevanna @open_ai Understood. My plan is to do whatever will make our researchers more productive—may mean long periods of silence.
684806818598502400,Wed Jan 06 18:40:43 +0000 2016,@AmarnathRevanna @open_ai We're just getting started. We're focused on the long-term — real research progress can't be rushed.
684601178475237400,Wed Jan 06 05:03:34 +0000 2016,@CraigMerry @open_ai We'll be releasing papers, code, blog posts — really whatever's most useful to communicate and share our results.
683296415666303000,Sat Jan 02 14:38:55 +0000 2016,@TadashiHikari @open_ai Thanks! We're very much a centralized organization — cf https://t.co/tpHxuKtpu2. Will have many OSS projects though.

681546957442031600,Mon Dec 28 18:47:11 +0000 2015,@cauerego Too early to say for sure! Today we're focused on developing new capabilities in deep learning.

680213545309474800,Fri Dec 25 02:28:41 +0000 2015,@rafeco @harper Always fun. My favorite is getting back into a bricked machine where you have no password.
680208160917868500,Fri Dec 25 02:07:17 +0000 2015,(Fortunately, when you get it wrong, these days you usually can blow away an instance rather than try to remember how your ILOM works.)
680207444505542700,Fri Dec 25 02:04:27 +0000 2015,@kogir Nice :). `firehol try` is great for this: https://t.co/rCoY1d6NCA.
680206798427521000,Fri Dec 25 02:01:53 +0000 2015,Editing firewall config over SSH. A bit like sticking both hands into a flame to see if your new heat-proof gloves are working.
679823651978399700,Thu Dec 24 00:39:23 +0000 2015,It's shocking how much more important and difficult it is to remove code than to write it.
679822403816431600,Thu Dec 24 00:34:26 +0000 2015,On the other hand, a diffstat like this makes it feel worthwhile again. https://t.co/lici3kpysa
679820696885702700,Thu Dec 24 00:27:39 +0000 2015,Nothin' like a good merge conflict to remind you to avoid long-lived branches.

676196313722032100,Mon Dec 14 00:25:38 +0000 2015,@stanfordnlp @maxhkw Non-obviousness is most important: we don't want to work on a paper another group would do a month later, for example.
676195757641195500,Mon Dec 14 00:23:26 +0000 2015,@stanfordnlp @maxhkw And yep, while we think publication is important, we'll measure our results by quality rather than quantity.
676195282674040800,Mon Dec 14 00:21:33 +0000 2015,@stanfordnlp @open_ai We provide all the of the above! (The YC Research mission lays this out well: https://t.co/VmXSs8pxY6.)
675986658056081400,Sun Dec 13 10:32:33 +0000 2015,@chrisamccoy @hunterwalk No proprietary IP to spin out :). Note we may generate revenue at some point, but thru eg SaaS offering not patents
675919882576359400,Sun Dec 13 06:07:12 +0000 2015,@hunterwalk We want people who believe in our mission, and we're fully separate from any of the for-profit projects of our funders/chairs.
675708632701509600,Sat Dec 12 16:07:46 +0000 2015,@beaucronin We have a lot of flexibility, and will adapt depending on what we and others in the field discover.
675708472101576700,Sat Dec 12 16:07:08 +0000 2015,@beaucronin Yep, deep learning is where we're starting today, but it's not something we're tied to at our core.
675708329839206400,Sat Dec 12 16:06:34 +0000 2015,@jamesreggio If we get it right, it's the best parts of both worlds: researchers spending 100% of time on pure research, no grant proposals.
675707208865329200,Sat Dec 12 16:02:07 +0000 2015,@jamesreggio This is unifying the resources of private industry with the freedom and long time horizons of academia.
675531889164292100,Sat Dec 12 04:25:27 +0000 2015,@IgorBrigadir Completely correct. Our strategy is to hire a great team and focus on the long term. cc/ @paulmwatson @anildash @open_ai
675530577513181200,Sat Dec 12 04:20:15 +0000 2015,@beaucronin @open_ai Yep, data sharing with companies will be super important. This is one reason our industry connections will be valuable.

643475745969274900,Mon Sep 14 17:25:47 +0000 2015,Mobile e-commerce has always been pretty broken. Super proud of the @stripe team for working on fixing that: https://t.co/FxW7Md5ZwL.

638136686904373200,Sun Aug 30 23:50:16 +0000 2015,@shazow It's amazing. Definitely what I'll be working on for the foreseeable future.
628262277787947000,Mon Aug 03 17:52:54 +0000 2015,@nchintomby Definitely fun!

623255775008432100,Mon Jul 20 22:18:50 +0000 2015,@siavoshb You do have to wonder how much of a leg up a 4-dimension being would have. Exponentially or linearly more intuition?

623251421673201700,Mon Jul 20 22:01:33 +0000 2015,@smasher5 I've been slacking on updating my Github repo, I know. Will try to keep updating.
623243310753255400,Mon Jul 20 21:29:19 +0000 2015,Turns out it's hard to develop good intuitions about many-thousand-dimensional spaces.
623242656655781900,Mon Jul 20 21:26:43 +0000 2015,Partly seems because neural nets are poorly understood, so no one feels embarrassed admitting their results weren't borne of pure ideation.
623240531695550500,Mon Jul 20 21:18:16 +0000 2015,Neural network papers are some of the most readable I've found. The authors tend to show the discovery process, rather than just the result.
621026223901143000,Tue Jul 14 18:39:24 +0000 2015,Intuition-defying ML results are a surprisingly good debugger.
620791768968265700,Tue Jul 14 03:07:46 +0000 2015,That feeling when you realize the subcase you just solved was the only hard one.
619962789717745700,Sat Jul 11 20:13:42 +0000 2015,@smasher5 Well, it's got 8 DIMM slots... just sayin'.
619941959872958500,Sat Jul 11 18:50:55 +0000 2015,Apparently you can now get 32GB sticks of RAM: http://t.co/nzyTGqDjZw. Price per GB is a bit high, but that's still super cool.
619355443589161000,Fri Jul 10 04:00:19 +0000 2015,Machine learning: 90% data manipulation, 9% running experiments with various hyperparameters, 1% victory.
619352980345757700,Fri Jul 10 03:50:32 +0000 2015,@ragrum Cool. That'll work just fine!

619351486301126700,Fri Jul 10 03:44:35 +0000 2015,Giving up on training this LSTM on my own. Time to go read some papers. Kind of like cheat codes for a struggling neural network creator.
619349381448343600,Fri Jul 10 03:36:14 +0000 2015,@ragrum Cool! There's no special support for that though. You could hack it via file-descriptor juggling depending on your use-case.

618954046691520500,Thu Jul 09 01:25:18 +0000 2015,@michael_nielsen @neilfws Triangle also probably fits your criteria exactly :).
618953805263204400,Thu Jul 09 01:24:21 +0000 2015,@michael_nielsen @neilfws May not *quite* fit the category (it's close but non-traditional), but I suspect you'd like Coherence a lot.
618953517957541900,Thu Jul 09 01:23:12 +0000 2015,@michael_nielsen @neilfws I liked Predestination a lot. It's slow going at first, but gets pretty interesting.
618153812629561300,Mon Jul 06 20:25:28 +0000 2015,Task for the day: playing with Torch (hopefully not the same as playing with fire). Lua looks fun.

616590554542043100,Thu Jul 02 12:53:38 +0000 2015,@bballinger I'd started with Theano due to their excellent tutorials, and then went hunting for a higher-level abstraction.
616480082413154300,Thu Jul 02 05:34:39 +0000 2015,@prakharsriv9 (This network is actually pretty small as far as these things go, I think.)
616479942918996000,Thu Jul 02 05:34:06 +0000 2015,@prakharsriv9 No, don't think so. Right now I'm RAM bound due to some naive input processing. With a bit of cleverness could run on laptop.
616478430037737500,Thu Jul 02 05:28:05 +0000 2015,That was fun. Now to redo my solution to practice some other network implementations and try some memory tricks I've been pondering...
616477022261542900,Thu Jul 02 05:22:30 +0000 2015,And boosted to an even larger network (now 4 hidden layers and something like 180k parameters) for #1.
616469307359404000,Thu Jul 02 04:51:50 +0000 2015,@avibryant (My validation loss seems to be monotonically dropping, which I think means I'm not overfitting.)
616468637222850600,Thu Jul 02 04:49:11 +0000 2015,@avibryant I'm not regularizing at all, but my (naive) suspicion is that my dataset size is large relative to my network size.
616468437800513500,Thu Jul 02 04:48:23 +0000 2015,@avibryant In general they are, though there are standard regularization techniques (such as dropout: http://t.co/mg1BgrkJHJ).
616429451472183300,Thu Jul 02 02:13:28 +0000 2015,@odeke_et I can post the materials I've been using. I tend to try to build, fail, go read some source material, and return to building.
616429298459803600,Thu Jul 02 02:12:52 +0000 2015,@odeke_et I've been self teaching. The learning curve is steep, and often frustrating, but have been persisting through. It's been worth it.
616426460371394600,Thu Jul 02 02:01:35 +0000 2015,Aaand after switching to a larger network, I'm now #2. Thanks, deep learning rig.
616366823181787100,Wed Jul 01 22:04:36 +0000 2015,@prakharsriv9 @kaggle It's pretty nice, isn't it?

616329173037117400,Wed Jul 01 19:35:00 +0000 2015,@michael_nielsen Fortunately it seems like more of a non-deterministic curse.
616328917180411900,Wed Jul 01 19:33:59 +0000 2015,@michael_nielsen This was my first independently-created neural network, and I spent about two days sure I was cursed.

615285007981113300,Sun Jun 28 22:25:52 +0000 2015,@sknthla Isn't it? All the better to deep learn with. So long as it doesn't blow a fuse.

615255297431588900,Sun Jun 28 20:27:48 +0000 2015,@patrickc That's giving up on GPU and just doing CPU training right?
615255079193591800,Sun Jun 28 20:26:56 +0000 2015,@patrickc Yes, though it's deeper than just the software. Two good posts on GPU clusters https://t.co/BV4AjMucqR or http://t.co/sskQirMmUS.
615254492255227900,Sun Jun 28 20:24:36 +0000 2015,@patrickc You unfortunately can't really do distributed training with GPUs today, so the power of your GPU actually matters quite a lot.
615254124138000400,Sun Jun 28 20:23:08 +0000 2015,@patrickc I've been using one, but its GPU is significantly underpowered relative to what you can buy.

615249512165150700,Sun Jun 28 20:04:49 +0000 2015,@beerwheeltravel Close! It's basically throwing a lot of computation into a hole and hoping a trained neural network crawls out.

570616552011092000,Wed Feb 25 16:09:22 +0000 2015,@TonyLPTG @stripe Sorry, search was indeed temporarily down: https://t.co/aRSCXrTKo5. All fixed!
570615846751461400,Wed Feb 25 16:06:34 +0000 2015,@collinmathilde @LukesBeard @stripe Sorry about that; search was broken temporarily. Should be good now: https://t.co/aRSCXrTKo5.
570490982485008400,Wed Feb 25 07:50:24 +0000 2015,@frazelledazzell @stripe It sure beat the raw LXC manipulation we'd started out with :).
570489948882604000,Wed Feb 25 07:46:17 +0000 2015,@frazelledazzell @stripe We didn't open-source the framework code, no. It all ran on Docker though!
569745124437073900,Mon Feb 23 06:26:37 +0000 2015,@c17r_ @stripe Hah, I know, right? cc/ @zenazn
569738761933713400,Mon Feb 23 06:01:20 +0000 2015,@c17r_ @stripe Nothing public yet, but we do have some stuff in the works!
568644213501337600,Fri Feb 20 05:32:00 +0000 2015,@DominikTo Nope, as it stands the receivers can only be used for a single payment.
568564524258701300,Fri Feb 20 00:15:20 +0000 2015,@davidstalane @stripe Ah, we invited many beta users off of the waitlist—was very important for getting the product right. cc/ @chranderson
568484039277092860,Thu Feb 19 18:55:31 +0000 2015,@breakingjac @stripe Nope: we charge 0.5% (and nothing else).
568482914507333600,Thu Feb 19 18:51:03 +0000 2015,This is why modular payment APIs are so powerful: an entirely new method of payment can be enabled without building a new integration.
568482142315012100,Thu Feb 19 18:47:59 +0000 2015,Enabling @stripe's Bitcoin support is just adding a single line to your Checkout integration: https://t.co/4v7lFzBvrt.
567382777264222200,Mon Feb 16 17:59:30 +0000 2015,@foamcow @stripe Nope, that's up to the form implementer. Sounds like you probably need a `return false` on form submission!
567359876318253060,Mon Feb 16 16:28:30 +0000 2015,@foamcow @stripe If so, probably worth looking at those failed token creations to see what's been happening.
567359762455466000,Mon Feb 16 16:28:03 +0000 2015,@foamcow @stripe Are most of those token creations (POST /v1/tokens), without corresponding charge creations?
567356904297353200,Mon Feb 16 16:16:41 +0000 2015,@foamcow @justin_kimbrell @stripe They should also be able to see their logs here: https://t.co/lCrLlu4AMV.
567356725666132000,Mon Feb 16 16:15:59 +0000 2015,@foamcow @justin_kimbrell @stripe A 402 generally indicates that the card was declined — maybe they're using a test card?
567014974493433860,Sun Feb 15 17:37:59 +0000 2015,@AkuMutanen Sorry about the trouble! Will look into this internally; you should have an answer soon.
566807038710136800,Sun Feb 15 03:51:43 +0000 2015,@jfriedlaender @stripe Sure thing, gdb@stripe.com.
566780480880513000,Sun Feb 15 02:06:11 +0000 2015,@jfriedlaender @stripe Sorry to hear that — what sort of trouble are you running into? Anything I can do to help?
566316657283321860,Fri Feb 13 19:23:07 +0000 2015,@tomwalki Ah got it. Will pass that along internally.
566312440674021400,Fri Feb 13 19:06:22 +0000 2015,@tomwalki Sorry, think I'm missing something — how's that different from the current implementation?
566285156483219460,Fri Feb 13 17:17:57 +0000 2015,@tomwalki (So we're definitely working on fixing that.)
566285088644530200,Fri Feb 13 17:17:40 +0000 2015,@tomwalki (It sounds kinda arbitrary, but it's a consequence of the bank transfer networks. Making this stuff easier is why we exist though)
566284730660687900,Fri Feb 13 17:16:15 +0000 2015,@tomwalki Hey Tom — unfortunately, for now you'll need a US-based USD bank account: https://t.co/jsbv9ZzTEk.
565443378683600900,Wed Feb 11 09:33:01 +0000 2015,@waitinggirl13 @jaythenerdkid @stripe We definitely want to help out here. We've just replied to your email with more details.
565439996472360960,Wed Feb 11 09:19:35 +0000 2015,@waitinggirl13 @stripe That doesn't sound right! We're looking at your email now and will respond shortly.
565269075711234050,Tue Feb 10 22:00:24 +0000 2015,@paraboul @phollow Yep, it'll happen, though the timeline is not yet set :).
564470641806417900,Sun Feb 08 17:07:43 +0000 2015,@oisinkim @stripe Gotcha. Ping me with details, and I'll dig in?
564467825570361340,Sun Feb 08 16:56:31 +0000 2015,@oisinkim @stripe If something seems more systemic, feel free to ping me on email/GChat (gdb@stripe.com), and I'll be happy to dig in.
564467657076789250,Sun Feb 08 16:55:51 +0000 2015,@oisinkim @stripe That *generally* indicates that there's an upstream issue specific to your card (e.g. your bank is having issues).
562456638657802240,Tue Feb 03 03:44:47 +0000 2015,@brentdax @stripe For the next month!
561917250014179300,Sun Feb 01 16:01:26 +0000 2015,@deepak_s_rawat @stripe It'll happen. Timeline is not set though! cc/ @sidd
559792998347984900,Mon Jan 26 19:20:25 +0000 2015,@startupvitamins I do like eggs, but unfortunately that's not actually one of my quotes! :)
559774348576583700,Mon Jan 26 18:06:19 +0000 2015,@loopj I think people will try to talk you out of (seemingly) high-risk decisions generally. Most of the time they're right.
559771226227638300,Mon Jan 26 17:53:55 +0000 2015,In 2010, my friends tried to talk me out of joining @stripe asking "why do payments matter"? A good explanation today http://t.co/gbrst3fPoK
556950455004438500,Sun Jan 18 23:05:10 +0000 2015,@kressaty @stripe Thanks for the heads up — per https://t.co/8ceBblwUaP, security@stripe.com is probably the best place.
556122275510890500,Fri Jan 16 16:14:17 +0000 2015,@wjgilmore @kartar Gotcha. There is a buried line (search "If you subscribe a customer" on https://t.co/H117rEu4pM) but we can make clearer.
556117427973410800,Fri Jan 16 15:55:01 +0000 2015,@wjgilmore @kartar Yep, we support it: https://t.co/W50Dhoay3T. Have you ben seeing something different?
555803208010838000,Thu Jan 15 19:06:25 +0000 2015,@pjrvs @stripe Hey Paul — sorry about this. We're looking into it. I'm gdb@stripe.com on email/GChat if you want to talk immediately.
555118218344288260,Tue Jan 13 21:44:31 +0000 2015,@peeja Thanks! Glad it's useful to you :).
554849682347003900,Tue Jan 13 03:57:27 +0000 2015,@benjaminlotan @stripestatus @stripe @patrickc Sorry you're running into that — it's a legacy DigiCert certificate that expired.
554849415597654000,Tue Jan 13 03:56:23 +0000 2015,@benjaminlotan @stripestatus @stripe @patrickc Ah, try following the instructions here: https://t.co/97xwVb95VW.
554524832180600800,Mon Jan 12 06:26:37 +0000 2015,@aaronklaassen @stripe John Wick got pretty close — it had its own prominently-featured currency :).
554468040482365440,Mon Jan 12 02:40:57 +0000 2015,@destroytoday @oscargodson Yep, it's just if you're making a Stripe Connect application.
554467274677960700,Mon Jan 12 02:37:54 +0000 2015,@destroytoday @oscargodson (See https://t.co/l2RLYuahbK for this called out explicitly — we should really link it from the other section.)
554466018228064260,Mon Jan 12 02:32:54 +0000 2015,@destroytoday @oscargodson @stripe Because testmode should mean the *application developer* is testing, not that the application user is.
554465652254052350,Mon Jan 12 02:31:27 +0000 2015,@destroytoday @oscargodson @stripe That line applies to Connect application authors. Basically testmode for applications is ambiguous
552875262288076800,Wed Jan 07 17:11:49 +0000 2015,@mtschammer @stripe No problem — I should have been more clear!
552874224852160500,Wed Jan 07 17:07:41 +0000 2015,@mtschammer @stripe But your fingerprints won't match another accounts', if that makes sense.
552874131172388860,Wed Jan 07 17:07:19 +0000 2015,@mtschammer @stripe So, in the usual case of one Stripe account, it's a function of card number only.
552874004542132200,Wed Jan 07 17:06:49 +0000 2015,@mtschammer @stripe To be clear, by "account" I mean "Stripe account", not customer.
552872669683920900,Wed Jan 07 17:01:30 +0000 2015,@mtschammer @stripe No — it's unique fingerprint per account + card number.
550336626371866600,Wed Dec 31 17:04:11 +0000 2014,@farmdawgnation @stripe No problem. (And thanks!)
550335814744678400,Wed Dec 31 17:00:57 +0000 2014,@ArthurGuy @stripe That's the receipt_number param on the Charge: https://t.co/F66TD2r3Iz. It's randomly generated on our end.
550335562071425000,Wed Dec 31 16:59:57 +0000 2014,@farmdawgnation @stripe Great :)! Sounds like a solution?
550334461804822500,Wed Dec 31 16:55:35 +0000 2014,@farmdawgnation @stripe Have you seen the weekly emails: https://t.co/pB9SQdek2S? Would aggregated monthly ones be useful in addition?
550332098540998660,Wed Dec 31 16:46:11 +0000 2014,@farmdawgnation @stripe (We're always very careful about backwards compatibility, so at the very least it shouldn't break to batch upgrades)
550331849135120400,Wed Dec 31 16:45:12 +0000 2014,@farmdawgnation @stripe Anything we could do to make your life better?
550331746160762900,Wed Dec 31 16:44:47 +0000 2014,@farmdawgnation @stripe Aww sorry to hear that :(. We figure users want new functionality as fast as possible, so we roll out when ready.
550050923007844350,Tue Dec 30 22:08:54 +0000 2014,@scottmeinzer @stripe Ah doesn't sound fun — that's display is due to @ROXIMITY's integration though, not sure if it's a bug or intentional.
549988367602311200,Tue Dec 30 18:00:19 +0000 2014,@h2oisgood4u @stripe Very soon! See http://t.co/d4LvJLaoJH :).
549973771902517250,Tue Dec 30 17:02:19 +0000 2014,@minorblend Yes, that's fine — go for it!
549711670298570750,Mon Dec 29 23:40:50 +0000 2014,@DonaldASuth Yep, that's right.
549706700979445760,Mon Dec 29 23:21:05 +0000 2014,@DonaldASuth Yeah, if the plans are in the dashboard then you can just refer to them by name.

549695416263245800,Mon Dec 29 22:36:14 +0000 2014,@DonaldASuth There are options for simple backends if you don't want to host your own server, e.g. Parse.
549694978906394600,Mon Dec 29 22:34:30 +0000 2014,@DonaldASuth Yep, you'll need a server-side component. We've considered adding support for client-side only, but there are subtle issues.
549693859266314240,Mon Dec 29 22:30:03 +0000 2014,@DonaldASuth @stripe (See https://t.co/XHXfWxGjV4.)
549693723333107700,Mon Dec 29 22:29:31 +0000 2014,@DonaldASuth @stripe You'll need a server-side component: checkout creates a Token, which you can then use to create a Customer on a Plan.
549693114957705200,Mon Dec 29 22:27:06 +0000 2014,@jodyheavener @stripe It's just a view toggle — won't change anything in your account. Sorry about the confusion!

547846900071034900,Wed Dec 24 20:10:54 +0000 2014,@RossJenkins1 Got it — thanks for the detail. Will look into it. Sorry about the trouble.

496158926853779460,Mon Aug 04 05:01:21 +0000 2014,@Rommel_Rico The key to doing this is having "gateways", which you send money to in exchange for credit o the network.

491614576471834600,Tue Jul 22 16:03:43 +0000 2014,@michaelthebrady @stripe I don't think so, honestly. I just think mainstream consumers aren't actively looking for a new currency.
491486201237344260,Tue Jul 22 07:33:36 +0000 2014,@duncsand @aral @stripe Yeah, this is more a vision of where the ecosystem is going, rather than a statement of Stripe's role.

491239188658782200,Mon Jul 21 15:12:04 +0000 2014,@Winum Sure, that's fine. Maybe easiest way to implement is by charging $3 up front, and giving them a free trial for 3 days.

490182372458242050,Fri Jul 18 17:12:39 +0000 2014,@jublonet If the card expires, it'll have the same behavior manually or automatically, and result in declines.
490181992039071740,Fri Jul 18 17:11:08 +0000 2014,@jublonet Just, most people find it convenient to let us take care of the details.
490181929703309300,Fri Jul 18 17:10:53 +0000 2014,@jublonet You're certainly welcome to charge your customer manually (and can do so in addition to them being on a plan).
490181821091422200,Fri Jul 18 17:10:27 +0000 2014,@jublonet Sorry about the slow reply here — when we charge, we can handle all of the complications of recurring billing (e.g. dunning)

488512346034159600,Mon Jul 14 02:36:34 +0000 2014,@b0rk But honestly my strategy often tends to be "switch to Linux VM".
488512220658008060,Mon Jul 14 02:36:04 +0000 2014,@b0rk Much less easily :(. You do get `lsof`, `gdb`, and `dtruss` (rather than `strace`), so you at least have *some* poke-y tools.

486836482997764100,Wed Jul 09 11:37:17 +0000 2014,@mr_mcd @jamesdevonport @stripe Importantly: their rate also doesn't scale with you. With Stripe, we sure rates stay competitive as you grow
486836164415193100,Wed Jul 09 11:36:01 +0000 2014,@mr_mcd @jamesdevonport @stripe E.g. extra 0.85% unless txn uses Verified by Visa; extra charges for Amex/Discover.

484354868279533600,Wed Jul 02 15:16:14 +0000 2014,@PawelDecowski Gotcha. Yeah, that's not a case we're well-optimized for at the moment. It's definitely on our radar though.
483724692524519400,Mon Jun 30 21:32:08 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso No problem. Let us know if you run into anything else!
483724085906534400,Mon Jun 30 21:29:43 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso :). Well, we just don't have a test card for this case ("attaches to customer but fails validation upon update").
483721375631147000,Mon Jun 30 21:18:57 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso To be clear, are you running in testmode or livemode? (In testmode, that is the correct behavior.)
483715124406931460,Mon Jun 30 20:54:07 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso Huh, that sounds like a bug to me. We'll dig into it. Thanks!
483710827795451900,Mon Jun 30 20:37:02 +0000 2014,@PawelDecowski It's on the charge page: https://t.co/KE7sa2BMkP&lt;ID&gt; (only if you created the charge on a customer).
483709349034872800,Mon Jun 30 20:31:10 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso By validation, I actually mean we'll run an authorization on the backend (so that number should fail). Seeing something diff?
483666729399119900,Mon Jun 30 17:41:49 +0000 2014,@GirlCalledJules Yes, go ahead. Here to help!
483607261898502140,Mon Jun 30 13:45:30 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso If you want to manually revalidate, as a hack you can update their card
483605298444111900,Mon Jun 30 13:37:42 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso You'll already have run a card validation or charge at original subscription time, so you won't be getting much new info.
483605003353858050,Mon Jun 30 13:36:32 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso Ah, so card validations tend to be mostly useful as "this card exists" rather than a predictor it can be charged an amount
483461360827645950,Mon Jun 30 04:05:45 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso there are downsides to an immediate prorated charge: it results in an uneven, off-cycle charge on people's statements
483460793027928060,Mon Jun 30 04:03:29 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso The short answer is there's a lot of complexity. Cards aren't really "good" or "bad" just currently chargeable or not
483386097720754200,Sun Jun 29 23:06:41 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso I can see a case for an "invoice immediately" flag, but I'd love to understand more about why you want it for your business.
483385750289780740,Sun Jun 29 23:05:18 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso as a separate step (so that a failing card doesn't stop them from using the product, just as with normal dunning)
483385589681500160,Sun Jun 29 23:04:40 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso Gotcha. What's your use-case? Many people want the customer to be able to change their plan, and then deal with failing cards
483357590630703100,Sun Jun 29 21:13:24 +0000 2014,@krystynheide @dbbradle Thanks :)! Let me know if you ever notice things we could do to make even Stripe better for you.

483348699943165950,Sun Jun 29 20:38:04 +0000 2014,@Stolen_Souls Got it. Yeah, above a certain size you probably don't want to use credit cards. We have more forms of payment coming though!

483347531574038500,Sun Jun 29 20:33:26 +0000 2014,@Stolen_Souls Thanks for the kind words :)! What about for taking real/large payments?
483347001715613700,Sun Jun 29 20:31:20 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso See "If you'd like to charge for an upgrade immediately" here: https://t.co/bymvsLo51y
483346929930084350,Sun Jun 29 20:31:02 +0000 2014,@JarrettLusso Only get an error when trying to charge the card. By default, we prorotate and charge the next month. You can invoice though:

483071193025904640,Sun Jun 29 02:15:22 +0000 2014,@kevinmontrose Gotcha. Yeah, it's really painful when things work inconsistently. Let me know if you ever see anything that we can improve!

483064793281331200,Sun Jun 29 01:49:56 +0000 2014,@cdevroe What was the confusion? Seems more likely we should doc better!

481474017438601200,Tue Jun 24 16:28:45 +0000 2014,@bettyatcoursera Hah :). People can appreciate recruiter contacts. It just sets a higher bar to establish sincerity.

476650951198375940,Wed Jun 11 09:03:37 +0000 2014,@kbudelis You could charge a credit card for $1000, and then partially refund it for $900 upon return of the item.

455436521597067260,Sun Apr 13 20:05:03 +0000 2014,@cschweitz @stripe Thanks! Glad you enjoyed :).
455116686078009340,Sat Apr 12 22:54:08 +0000 2014,@sanjay @stripe You're welcome :).
455114070883311600,Sat Apr 12 22:43:44 +0000 2014,@sanjay @stripe Yeah, we'd be happy to do that. I'm gdb@stripe.com if anyone from the project wants to get in touch to organize.
454338251802034200,Thu Apr 10 19:20:55 +0000 2014,@cjcsuhta @stripe It's a remarkably good discussion. Bruce Schneier linked there too, FWIW :).
454117226350915600,Thu Apr 10 04:42:38 +0000 2014,@danielpalacio @sama @stripe Cool. Keeping the notAfter date makes sense, though I can't think of a reason to keep notBefore.
454113493147729900,Thu Apr 10 04:27:48 +0000 2014,@danielpalacio @sama @stripe Ah — when Digicert rekeys a cert, they keep the same notBefore timestamp. The cert itself is fresh though.
454110760005021700,Thu Apr 10 04:16:56 +0000 2014,@danielpalacio @sama @stripe We have in fact rekeyed and revoked our old certs. Are you seeing something different?
452362912879747100,Sat Apr 05 08:31:37 +0000 2014,@erniemiller Sorry for the delay — had to perfect the design!

451376089068101600,Wed Apr 02 15:10:20 +0000 2014,@lasryaric yep!
451357310871289860,Wed Apr 02 13:55:43 +0000 2014,@lasryaric or have more RAM / SSDs
451357179069489150,Wed Apr 02 13:55:11 +0000 2014,@lasryaric yeah, the trick is to take down a secondary, bring it up as a singleton node, build. Repeat. Gross but works.
451128270679863300,Tue Apr 01 22:45:35 +0000 2014,@DShankar So I was partly against PayDemon b.c. we'd never get http://t.co/jqgZqQf8Kj. Didn't think about doing http://t.co/3hPknIIirO :).

449303158729109500,Thu Mar 27 21:53:15 +0000 2014,@grayj_ We're certainly very conscious of the implications of Bitcoin — neither we nor our merchants hold any: http://t.co/GJBqOnPkpT
449297363643797500,Thu Mar 27 21:30:13 +0000 2014,@grayj_ Any particular reason why?
449220911065886700,Thu Mar 27 16:26:25 +0000 2014,@flashpunk @stripe @litecoin We would certainly consider it — really just depends on merchant demand.

447916133958434800,Mon Mar 24 02:01:42 +0000 2014,@briansze @JorgeO Me either.
447807673962999800,Sun Mar 23 18:50:44 +0000 2014,@akrey @stripe Actually, managed to pull it up on our end — in fact it was due to prior fraud from your tor exit node. Now fixed.
447800616664842240,Sun Mar 23 18:22:41 +0000 2014,@akrey @stripe (In general, we pass through a decision made by your bank.)
447800207141797900,Sun Mar 23 18:21:03 +0000 2014,@akrey @stripe Seems unlikely. Email us (support@stripe.com) the last 4 digits of your card and the expiry and we can take a look.
447284753046073340,Sat Mar 22 08:12:49 +0000 2014,@jake_gold And if we don't bind the port, then it'll just look like we're down, which would be pretty confusing.
447284634817011700,Sat Mar 22 08:12:21 +0000 2014,@jake_gold We've considered it pretty carefully: plaintext HTTP won't serve the API successfully, so you'll at most send a testmode key.
447125797652807700,Fri Mar 21 21:41:12 +0000 2014,@lasryaric Hah, good catch. We'll switch to using 8.8.8.8. You can just use raw IPs as a workaround until then, if needed :).
446007043954982900,Tue Mar 18 19:35:40 +0000 2014,@b0rk Alll the things.
445980782784688100,Tue Mar 18 17:51:19 +0000 2014,@mahmoudimus Riemann is great. We're switching our real-time alerting to it, and have been happy so far.
445979306779738100,Tue Mar 18 17:45:27 +0000 2014,@mahmoudimus you can keep their scope limited to "what do I care about if my primary is out"
445979026075971600,Tue Mar 18 17:44:20 +0000 2014,@mahmoudimus I generally recommend having one primary system, and then one or more failsafes. They won't work as well, but
445978888758652900,Tue Mar 18 17:43:47 +0000 2014,@mahmoudimus Yeah, we run a couple of different systems (statsd, riemann, nagios, an internal monitoring system called Checker, NR).
445978005462978560,Tue Mar 18 17:40:17 +0000 2014,@mahmoudimus Nagios is a good choice for that, since it's rock stable. You can then also use it to monitor that your New Relic flow works.
445977824600404000,Tue Mar 18 17:39:33 +0000 2014,@mahmoudimus I'd recommend basic redundant checking ("Can I make a request?") independent of your primary alerting mechanism.

442777803495202800,Sun Mar 09 21:43:49 +0000 2014,@SmileyElectric The big difference is that Square is for in-person transactions, while Stripe is for online ones cc/ @stripe

439295479940018200,Fri Feb 28 07:06:18 +0000 2014,@suitcasepreneur @stripe Are you using a livemode API key? (Changing the view on your dashboard doesn't change your actual requests.)
439110789623205900,Thu Feb 27 18:52:25 +0000 2014,@hijonathan @stripe Hah, gotcha :).
439097950896005100,Thu Feb 27 18:01:24 +0000 2014,@hijonathan @stripe Haven't seen that before — are you able to connect to other SSL sites? Maybe you're on a network with a captive portal?
438032329886273540,Mon Feb 24 19:27:00 +0000 2014,@mdlugajczyk I think it's a property of software engineering, not languages: http://t.co/ZjV1s0kA4m
438025574636724200,Mon Feb 24 19:00:09 +0000 2014,@mdlugajczyk But new iterative development will remain in Ruby for the foreseeable future.
438025461067546600,Mon Feb 24 18:59:42 +0000 2014,@mdlugajczyk Stripe for example is starting to rewrite certain stable/known components in Go.
438025303315587100,Mon Feb 24 18:59:05 +0000 2014,@mdlugajczyk They tend to be less productive for small codebases, though partly because they force you to write better code from the start.
438024932606226400,Mon Feb 24 18:57:36 +0000 2014,@benbjohnson Also, Stripe is heavily invested, so regardless of why most people like it, we very much care about helping it succeed.
438024386214232060,Mon Feb 24 18:55:26 +0000 2014,@benbjohnson While I think it's losing ground, it is a low-barrier-to-entry lang with a strong supporter base and lots of existing infra.
438018930913714200,Mon Feb 24 18:33:45 +0000 2014,@ccheever I feel like Python has a much more solid foundation than Ruby at the moment. Much killer apps (numpy, etc), many bigco support.
438016630094696450,Mon Feb 24 18:24:37 +0000 2014,@ccheever (Where by "scares" I really mean "seems antithetical to the goal of trying to make Ruby relevant 10 years down the road".)
438015477143441400,Mon Feb 24 18:20:02 +0000 2014,@ccheever E.g. would you write the next generation of Chef or Puppet in node?
438015398034677760,Mon Feb 24 18:19:43 +0000 2014,@ccheever Yeah, node definitely scares me (feels like it may dominate web), but I'd be surprised if it became a good systems language.

437229856137297900,Sat Feb 22 14:18:15 +0000 2014,@obra yeah we did the MTA thing for a bit too. Actually started out with a series of directives for it to interpret. Worked well enough.

429876780204187650,Sun Feb 02 07:19:45 +0000 2014,@chantalclaret Looks like @patrickc is helping you out, but let me know if there's anything I can do.
429874194969403400,Sun Feb 02 07:09:29 +0000 2014,@benbjohnson Yep, there is. Not yet sure when though. cc/ @monkigras
429780782735847400,Sun Feb 02 00:58:18 +0000 2014,Just posted my slides on how to build better software through math: https://t.co/diXODDkGC4 (from Monkigras 2014)
429426841120550900,Sat Feb 01 01:31:51 +0000 2014,@InnerLambada @stripe Sorry to hear about the issues with Level 4 :(. We did what we could. Hopefully you got some enjoyment anyway?
429307562760994800,Fri Jan 31 17:37:53 +0000 2014,@DeeZsombor It was a surprise for us too :). People reported it close to the contests' end, at which point we decided to leave it alone.
429274227531710460,Fri Jan 31 15:25:26 +0000 2014,@RemiRichard @stripe Thanks :). Let me know if you have any feedback on parts that we could be doing better.
429271242407817200,Fri Jan 31 15:13:34 +0000 2014,Found two more writeups:  http://t.co/pkVv9U09BV https://t.co/EFRoBmDVHS  Anyone know of others?
429264460717768700,Fri Jan 31 14:46:37 +0000 2014,@benbjohnson Awesome. Glad CTF could actually be useful to the world rather than just swallowing programmer productivity for a week :).
429235670180040700,Fri Jan 31 12:52:13 +0000 2014,Reminder: tonight @ https://t.co/qO0yr3IgCj to hear all the best stories from running CTF3.
429233876087480300,Fri Jan 31 12:45:05 +0000 2014,5 CTF3 writeups so far: http://t.co/qgstSvWs5Y http://t.co/3O80OrnUdz http://t.co/sOwXmPVwv5 http://t.co/1ablUWON7a http://t.co/o4bjhH1Wzd
429025601354088450,Thu Jan 30 22:57:28 +0000 2014,@Geek_Manager Yep, I'm around. Free in the afternoon; then running http://t.co/X1vCiZJAGh. Shoot me an email (gdb@stripe.com)?
429015383480102900,Thu Jan 30 22:16:52 +0000 2014,@Geek_Manager Thanks for the kind words. Glad someone found it useful :).
428952372510220300,Thu Jan 30 18:06:29 +0000 2014,@kellylsims @rfavali It's true. Thanks Kelly!
428948443567247360,Thu Jan 30 17:50:53 +0000 2014,@RACarter Thanks for the feedback. Hopefully packet loss wasn't too high :)
428913018345623550,Thu Jan 30 15:30:07 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen infrastructure post forthcoming!
428913003204194300,Thu Jan 30 15:30:03 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen We run all the nodes in separate containers, so while I'm sure people tried, they wouldn't have gotten around the octopus.
428868979042844700,Thu Jan 30 12:35:07 +0000 2014,@davidescalzo Thanks!
428827210334470140,Thu Jan 30 09:49:08 +0000 2014,@_RosieJay Heh, I see. As you can imagine, those tend to be opted-out :).
428824193606488060,Thu Jan 30 09:37:09 +0000 2014,@sheenapakanati @sidd @luddep @stripe Given all my tyops, I might. Glad you had fun and are now edutained!
428822748027056100,Thu Jan 30 09:31:24 +0000 2014,@_RosieJay Hah. One important point is it's wholly opt-in: https://t.co/kQp4MF4aKx. Definitely would be bad otherwise. (Was that the issue?)
428814058125406200,Thu Jan 30 08:56:53 +0000 2014,@_RosieJay In a good way, I hope? :)
428787359132287000,Thu Jan 30 07:10:47 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen @stripe But definitely a great read :).
428786350918098940,Thu Jan 30 07:06:47 +0000 2014,@imothee @stripe Nicely done :).
428785994058313700,Thu Jan 30 07:05:22 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen @stripe Also, I *believe* we patched the issue where you could get by with a single-node setup for level 4 (but hard to get 100%).
428784954219053060,Thu Jan 30 07:01:14 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen @stripe (We fixed the bug once it was reported to us.) We did CPU accounting using cgroups, which means we got the process tree.
428784780096729100,Thu Jan 30 07:00:32 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen @stripe Nice writeup. For level 0, the hack was actually that you could have a *remote* process do that work, not a local one.
428784276339843100,Thu Jan 30 06:58:32 +0000 2014,@chtombleson (But also getting to level 4 isn't bad at all :).)
428784188381069300,Thu Jan 30 06:58:11 +0000 2014,@chtombleson We're still accepting solutions for the next couple hours, actually. Not too late to submit!
428692373011320800,Thu Jan 30 00:53:21 +0000 2014,If you're around London, I'll be speaking at https://t.co/qO0yr3IgCj on Friday evening. You should come by!
428683062524661760,Thu Jan 30 00:16:21 +0000 2014,(Also a decent number of war stories of things that went wrong, both silly and pretty deep, which should be fun to talk about.)
428682801961922560,Thu Jan 30 00:15:19 +0000 2014,Going to try writing a post on the CTF infra in the next few days. There's a lot of interesting stuff in there.
428682674421510140,Thu Jan 30 00:14:48 +0000 2014,@avivby @stripe Congrats on capturing the flag (again)!
428677814468874240,Wed Jan 29 23:55:30 +0000 2014,@rrjamie Nice :)!
428564195525672960,Wed Jan 29 16:24:01 +0000 2014,@hynek @stripe Donation is in :). Should be good now; sorry about the trouble.
428278429251686400,Tue Jan 28 21:28:29 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe Awesome work!
428273750455250940,Tue Jan 28 21:09:53 +0000 2014,@midhir Aww sorry to hear :(. How was the rest of it?
428273601200918500,Tue Jan 28 21:09:18 +0000 2014,@ProbablyOliver @stripe Congrats!
428273529365078000,Tue Jan 28 21:09:01 +0000 2014,@_bhaisaab You're welcome :).
427974829833084900,Tue Jan 28 01:22:05 +0000 2014,@danpalmer NP. Good luck!
427966837129609200,Tue Jan 28 00:50:19 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe but of course *which* 1-line thing is the hard part :).
427966794163171300,Tue Jan 28 00:50:09 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe Yep. My usual advice for system debugging is to strip away complexity — it usually just works out to a 1-line thing...
427966477140885500,Tue Jan 28 00:48:54 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe Hah. Whoops :). I mean... "I totally meant to leave that as a clue".
427966153667797000,Tue Jan 28 00:47:36 +0000 2014,@danopia @stripe Awesome work (again)!
427966113280839700,Tue Jan 28 00:47:27 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe So the patch to do *just* that can be pretty minimal. Could be worth trying on the unmodified code, and then do raft.
427965935857565700,Tue Jan 28 00:46:44 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe The way I built sqlcluster was actually by starting with Raft and then replacing it with our janky failover thing :).
427965278316552200,Tue Jan 28 00:44:08 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe Have you been able to get query proxying to work starting from our unmodified distribution?
427964403644780540,Tue Jan 28 00:40:39 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe Noooo! What're you running into?
427897990821326850,Mon Jan 27 20:16:45 +0000 2014,@mateolargo @stripe Sorry about the trouble — should be fixed now.
427848970405031940,Mon Jan 27 17:01:58 +0000 2014,RT @dmitrigrabov: #HNLondon is this Weds, featuring Stripe CTO @thegdb, @aral, @MMetternich and @MarioGintili. Get your tickets: http://t.c…
427693201017696260,Mon Jan 27 06:42:59 +0000 2014,@janosgyerik @stripe I'll take it :). That's useful to know.
427691071267536900,Mon Jan 27 06:34:32 +0000 2014,@gsoltis Well, at least this way we've given people a really realistic snapshot of what it is to build systems in Scala :).
427690080619069440,Mon Jan 27 06:30:35 +0000 2014,@gsoltis Yeah, it makes sense. We've done our best to make the builds faster, but only so much you can do.
427686221066674200,Mon Jan 27 06:15:15 +0000 2014,@janosgyerik @stripe How did the enjoyment level compare?
427685926869798900,Mon Jan 27 06:14:05 +0000 2014,@gsoltis We figured it wouldn't be a distributed systems CTF without *some* JVM. Would you have preferred a different JVM lang?
427560491573985300,Sun Jan 26 21:55:39 +0000 2014,@passy We were actually using the SBT downloads to test our DDOS defense shields.
427543301260988400,Sun Jan 26 20:47:21 +0000 2014,@kmrhb @b0rk Congrats :)!
427521708619071500,Sun Jan 26 19:21:32 +0000 2014,@freeformz @heroku Sure thing. Ping me at gdb@stripe.com?
427520864326668300,Sun Jan 26 19:18:11 +0000 2014,@freeformz Thanks! We use it in a bunch of places — it's been pretty transformative to have magical graceful restarts for everything.
427517720360255500,Sun Jan 26 19:05:42 +0000 2014,@bgreenlee @stripe Hah! Really, we felt any distributed systems CTF really needed to have some JVM, and this was the least painful option.
427505738630443000,Sun Jan 26 18:18:05 +0000 2014,@four_seven Congrats!
427505087489900540,Sun Jan 26 18:15:30 +0000 2014,@_bhaisaab @stripe Hey Rohit, have you tried running one of your remote testcases locally (via test/harness level3-...)?
427354022744297500,Sun Jan 26 08:15:13 +0000 2014,@jm_eisen @stripe +1
427353922928267260,Sun Jan 26 08:14:49 +0000 2014,@diana_clarke @stripe Nice work! Don't worry, level 4 is much easier than level 8 from last CTF :).
427289161226133500,Sun Jan 26 03:57:29 +0000 2014,@stderr Doing pretty well on that leaderboard :).
427272355207847940,Sun Jan 26 02:50:42 +0000 2014,@danpalmer @stripe Congrats! Almost done :).
427268052216860700,Sun Jan 26 02:33:36 +0000 2014,@Raybeorn @stripe Good luck! You can do it :).
427163961033629700,Sat Jan 25 19:39:59 +0000 2014,@SlexAxton @patrickc A word known only to anoraks.
427163732662173700,Sat Jan 25 19:39:04 +0000 2014,@erniemiller And Scala seemed to be the least-bad of the available options.
427163662004932600,Sat Jan 25 19:38:48 +0000 2014,@erniemiller Hah. That's not an inaccurate characterization :). Really, I felt it couldn't be a distributed systems CTF without *some* JVM.
427162608974577660,Sat Jan 25 19:34:36 +0000 2014,@erniemiller Congrats! What'd you think?
427147260762144800,Sat Jan 25 18:33:37 +0000 2014,@patrickc If only they were convertible into Bitcoins...
427138846577283100,Sat Jan 25 18:00:11 +0000 2014,@Hoffrocket @stripe Congrats :). What'd you think?
427135081098928100,Sat Jan 25 17:45:13 +0000 2014,@DushyantRaoC @stripe Well done! :)
426985719236534300,Sat Jan 25 07:51:43 +0000 2014,@StephenCWan Congrats! How was level 3?
426958457451720700,Sat Jan 25 06:03:23 +0000 2014,@acr Well done! :)
426958382096867300,Sat Jan 25 06:03:05 +0000 2014,@jm @nzkoz Good luck. Feel free to email us your username (lvl3-*) at ctf@stripe.com, and we'll see if we can provide any guidance.
426957223319719940,Sat Jan 25 05:58:29 +0000 2014,@jm @nzkoz (Albeit, one I'd be sad if people *have* to do.)
426957106973917200,Sat Jan 25 05:58:01 +0000 2014,@jm @nzkoz (Creating the level wasn't easy either. On the plus side, a lot of people have gotten it, and rewriting in Python is an option.)
426954242851487740,Sat Jan 25 05:46:38 +0000 2014,@jm @nzkoz I can certainly buy the moral of the story is JVM is more annoying than it's worth (especially for anything one-off).
426953779557064700,Sat Jan 25 05:44:48 +0000 2014,@jm @nzkoz Yeah, sorry about that. I figured it wouldn't be a distributed systems CTF if there wasn't JVM.
426934337431277600,Sat Jan 25 04:27:32 +0000 2014,@jhchen @stripe real time. (Was thinking about building some fancy infrastructure for it, but decided we wanted to launch more :).)
426934195953233900,Sat Jan 25 04:26:59 +0000 2014,@jhchen @stripe Was also thinking about switching to the sum of your positions on the various leaderboards, but that'd be hard to compute in
426934038792638460,Sat Jan 25 04:26:21 +0000 2014,@jhchen @stripe with the lowest hanging fruit left. But the number you end up with is pretty opaque/hard to explain.
426933886325493760,Sat Jan 25 04:25:45 +0000 2014,@jhchen @stripe Yep. We actually launched with the sum of the logs of your scores, which would incentivize you to work on the level
426872424240386050,Sat Jan 25 00:21:31 +0000 2014,@jhchen @stripe Effectively, yes. I tried a few different overall rankings, but didn't find one I liked. Any suggestions?
426801770996564000,Fri Jan 24 19:40:46 +0000 2014,@slevenbits Yep, I'd been hypothesizing that. Wanted to see how long it'd take for someone to figure it out :).
426765916295032800,Fri Jan 24 17:18:18 +0000 2014,@whit537 @github @stripe Now just to find a spare O(1 week) lying around...
426765702419062800,Fri Jan 24 17:17:27 +0000 2014,@slevenbits Aight, bumping next round to 00000008ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff. Let's see what happens to the leaderboard...
426764644196163600,Fri Jan 24 17:13:14 +0000 2014,@whit537 @stripe So my plan is to finish the polishing (probably O(1 week of work)), and then release the manager as a sample app.
426764501120086000,Fri Jan 24 17:12:40 +0000 2014,@whit537 @stripe It's built on our in-house application framework, which I've done about half of the work needed to clean up for open-source
426626069165117440,Fri Jan 24 08:02:35 +0000 2014,@patio11 @stripe Thanks for the kind words. Glad you enjoyed :).
426613308909555700,Fri Jan 24 07:11:53 +0000 2014,@jm (At least we didn't make you write raw Java :)!)
426613213283631100,Fri Jan 24 07:11:30 +0000 2014,@jm It wouldn't be a distributed systems CTF without Java, though, would it?
426612997054689300,Fri Jan 24 07:10:39 +0000 2014,@platypii Thanks :). Glad you enjoyed!
426611758430564350,Fri Jan 24 07:05:43 +0000 2014,@NefariousZhen :(. We worked pretty hard to minimize environment issues, but obviously 100% is too much to hope.
426566114466725900,Fri Jan 24 04:04:21 +0000 2014,@solomonstre @alberge Just shoot me an email at gdb@stripe.com.
426564838752399360,Fri Jan 24 03:59:17 +0000 2014,@solomonstre @munchybunch For sure (cc/ @alberge).
426561302043967500,Fri Jan 24 03:45:14 +0000 2014,@grantovich @stripe Nice :). Yeah, my reference implementation was a Ruby implementation, which is what we pegged the bot mining speed to :)
426551696639016960,Fri Jan 24 03:07:04 +0000 2014,@munchybunch Good point on level 4. #willfix cc/ @zenazn
426551579987042300,Fri Jan 24 03:06:36 +0000 2014,@munchybunch Not quite ready for what we're doing. In their defense, they do document that, but CTF is about experimentation (2/2)
426551413422845950,Fri Jan 24 03:05:56 +0000 2014,@munchybunch Yeah, it was a *lot* of fun to build. We're using docker, but honestly regretting it — it's a cool interface, but (1/2)
426549410281963500,Fri Jan 24 02:57:58 +0000 2014,@slevenbits Yeah, I was wondering whether that'd become the limiting factor. Would your life be better if we bumped the difficulty?
426548874220535800,Fri Jan 24 02:55:51 +0000 2014,@munchybunch Nice work! What'd you think?
426548742812991500,Fri Jan 24 02:55:19 +0000 2014,@srage10 @stripe Glad you're enjoying :).
426489192349069300,Thu Jan 23 22:58:41 +0000 2014,@sicophasic It's working! Well, halfway at least :). What're the frustrating parts? Anything we could do better?
426452746863013900,Thu Jan 23 20:33:52 +0000 2014,@gredaline @patrickc @lfranchi And voila, a setting to hide high scores: https://t.co/px3wBH9DuS. May your CTF be stress free!
426420338683936800,Thu Jan 23 18:25:05 +0000 2014,@gredaline @patrickc @lfranchi Ok, that's really helpful. Let me whip something together. Thanks!
426418063248863200,Thu Jan 23 18:16:03 +0000 2014,@patrickc @gredaline @lfranchi where you can turn off the "high score" display? Or is having "scores as how to advance levels" an issue too?
426417813222207500,Thu Jan 23 18:15:03 +0000 2014,@patrickc @gredaline @lfranchi a sense of what's possible. I actually don't like competitions myself. Would it help if we provided a mode...
426417530337378300,Thu Jan 23 18:13:56 +0000 2014,@patrickc @gredaline @lfranchi Hey, sorry :(. We definitely tried to make the scoring low-key by default, and just give you a target and...

424669734575935500,Sat Jan 18 22:28:49 +0000 2014,@eevee @stripe It's distributed systems rather than infosec this time. This way we can distract even more people :).

424271487357288450,Fri Jan 17 20:06:19 +0000 2014,@dbrown428 @stripe Gotcha. That's pretty reasonable — I think probably the right answer is add the option of using a requestor instance.

395800013005013000,Thu Oct 31 06:30:51 +0000 2013,@pleonasm Anyway, I think making it DI-friendly would just be refactoring out all the `new Stripe_ApiRequestor` calls — up for writing a PR?
395799373533044740,Thu Oct 31 06:28:18 +0000 2013,@pleonasm @stripe Well, we also want to ensure there's only one way to do everything, which makes it hard to support both.
395761781252968450,Thu Oct 31 03:58:56 +0000 2013,@pleonasm @stripe I'd be fine with restructuring the backend to make dependency injection easier though — that shouldn't be pretty easy.
395761511622139900,Thu Oct 31 03:57:51 +0000 2013,@pleonasm @stripe The main problem with using a requestor object is that it makes the simple cases harder.
395753679350820860,Thu Oct 31 03:26:44 +0000 2013,@pleonasm @stripe We do static methods where there's no object reference yet. What alternative do you have in mind?

355359677640474600,Thu Jul 11 16:15:24 +0000 2013,@Andre2999 Yes, this is for our non-card holder data environment. (Which is the vast majority of our code.)
355034811217354750,Wed Jul 10 18:44:29 +0000 2013,@luebken The individual teams have actually adopted something similar to a rotating scrum master.
355006950871793660,Wed Jul 10 16:53:47 +0000 2013,@luebken We look for how people produce code, given a somewhat clear system they want to end up with.
355006704993304600,Wed Jul 10 16:52:48 +0000 2013,@luebken Try doing something that's pure code (i.e. doesn't have network dependencies). A standard object-oriented project is fine.
355006478991630340,Wed Jul 10 16:51:54 +0000 2013,@luebken And often we try to make sure that *someone* is watching the overall system for problems, and going in to fix them.
355006197222473700,Wed Jul 10 16:50:47 +0000 2013,@luebken Being able to give people feedback is key — I think everyone needs some guidance from an outside observer at some point.
355005856863105000,Wed Jul 10 16:49:26 +0000 2013,@luebken A lot of that's about good communication: if people are talking to each other, it tends to work itself out.
354999368769740800,Wed Jul 10 16:23:39 +0000 2013,@lasryaric No problem!
353587356747579400,Sat Jul 06 18:52:49 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe Security is also a core focus; things like our CTF competitions (https://t.co/l2XfToiSTp) are good examples of how we think.
353586014759026700,Sat Jul 06 18:47:29 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe Coherency of the product is also externally observable. I'd love to hear if you think we could improve on the product front.
353585174988070900,Sat Jul 06 18:44:09 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe Stability is a top priority for us, and we're transparent about the results: https://t.co/HCDS7yHXlS
353584767691796500,Sat Jul 06 18:42:32 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe There seem to be two intertwined comments there: moving quickly vs stability, and self-direction of engineers vs coherency.
353557633606758400,Sat Jul 06 16:54:43 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe Our solution certainly wasn't novel, but it was the first time we introduced a formal structure for choosing what to work on
353556951797469200,Sat Jul 06 16:52:00 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe Also re: teams comment, my point was that at first people organized their work completely independently, which didn't scale.
353555095876681700,Sat Jul 06 16:44:38 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe (It's by design quite isolated &amp; stable, so it generally doesn't affect our day-to-day workflow.)
353554511635296260,Sat Jul 06 16:42:18 +0000 2013,@andybritcliffe Well, as a heads up the transcript isn't exhaustive. E.g. our core credit card code is treated very differently.

256195198399430660,Thu Oct 11 00:51:09 +0000 2012,API is such a buzzword.
256161320041328640,Wed Oct 10 22:36:32 +0000 2012,@majek04 Gotcha. Unfortunately not -- the architecture here was pretty complicated.
256077107644481540,Wed Oct 10 17:01:54 +0000 2012,@majek04 We published the level sources this time (rather than an AMI): https://t.co/XrbNbK15
255868925856870400,Wed Oct 10 03:14:40 +0000 2012,Forcing your reverse proxy to always try a backend (even when all of them are in maintenance mode) is a surprisingly good idea.
255822734343434240,Wed Oct 10 00:11:07 +0000 2012,Just figured out how to access Ruby's toplevel object from an arbitrary scope: TOPLEVEL_BINDING.eval('self')
254827870705291260,Sun Oct 07 06:17:53 +0000 2012,@jeffreycrowell @stripe We just finalized the logistics, and the first shirts were sent on Friday.

245910383372681200,Wed Sep 12 15:42:58 +0000 2012,@antifuchs scsh is cooler due to Scheme's "data is code is data" thing. Not possible to make the syntax in Ruby quite as nice.
245896144482349060,Wed Sep 12 14:46:24 +0000 2012,Just released Rubysh, a Ruby subprocess library: https://t.co/TgHXTedO

245585198551556100,Tue Sep 11 18:10:48 +0000 2012,Ruby desperately needs a native assert method.
245180158498201600,Mon Sep 10 15:21:19 +0000 2012,@gleitz Yes, we released the source for the levels -- see the wrapup post.
245179216516243460,Mon Sep 10 15:17:35 +0000 2012,@gleitz Yep, CTF is over: https://t.co/XrbNbK15. Just modified the site to make this more obvious.
241730460936445950,Sat Sep 01 02:53:27 +0000 2012,@diana_clarke The overarching goal for us is to make Stripe (and the events we run) a welcoming place for women.
241730269080588300,Sat Sep 01 02:52:41 +0000 2012,@diana_clarke For example http://t.co/px9mLvIW -- last hackathon was nearly 30% women.
241730182505975800,Sat Sep 01 02:52:21 +0000 2012,@diana_clarke Very good question -- looks like we have 17 women's t-shirt requests, out of 968. This is an issue we care about.
241673828835663870,Fri Aug 31 23:08:25 +0000 2012,@simeonwillbanks @stripe Nope, unfortunately not currently planning on it. I think it'd change a lot of the atmosphere.
241267462824411140,Thu Aug 30 20:13:40 +0000 2012,@josdough @stripe I expect it'll be about 3 hours.
240970599659347970,Thu Aug 30 00:34:02 +0000 2012,@Gurpartap Nope - the process of opening the socket is Ruby, but once opened it's the same as a socket opened by Redis itself.
240930238580809730,Wed Aug 29 21:53:39 +0000 2012,@AngelHack Would love to chat. Shoot me an email at gdb@stripe.com!
240911120985100300,Wed Aug 29 20:37:41 +0000 2012,@zacharyvoase Really sorry about that :(. It's a constraint of the venue (which we had to find on short notice). Willfix in the future.
240887158142013440,Wed Aug 29 19:02:28 +0000 2012,And CTF is over. Hope you enjoyed! (If you're around SF, you should come to our meetup: http://t.co/stVP3vic)
240859449609293820,Wed Aug 29 17:12:22 +0000 2012,@pepperbox Yes, sorry :(. We'll be publicly releasing the levels in the next few weeks though.
240859253471080450,Wed Aug 29 17:11:35 +0000 2012,@NaomiCBush Unfortunately we won't be streaming. Sorry :(.
240695849871609860,Wed Aug 29 06:22:17 +0000 2012,@Gurpartap It shouldn't affect performance at all. You'd have to modify Redis to use an already-opened FD though.
240695663195717630,Wed Aug 29 06:21:32 +0000 2012,@Gurpartap Not quite. Einhorn opens the socket and immediate spins up n workers, each with the socket open.

239644869461684220,Sun Aug 26 08:46:03 +0000 2012,@homakov Heh. Most recent reason is because a buggy regex made one of the CTF levels easier than I meant it to be. Oh well.

223819234076139520,Fri Jul 13 16:40:38 +0000 2012,Inception is actually a metaphor for programming. Creation where the only limit is your mind? Changes causing attackers (bugs) to manifest?

216643194249678850,Sat Jun 23 21:25:37 +0000 2012,Is Ruby's YAML implementation safe to run on untrusted strings? It's kind of unclear whether you can use it for code execution.

208751133504700400,Sat Jun 02 02:45:23 +0000 2012,@sridatta Actually just polling -- latency ends up being O(1 second) which is fine for our use-cases. Plan to add oplog tailing if needed.

107164703159091200,Fri Aug 26 18:57:10 +0000 2011,@sidd Ouch. I do always opt out of the body scanners, actually, so there is some opt-in groping.

103543170201161730,Tue Aug 16 19:06:30 +0000 2011,@rep_movsd The problem is that the amount of data tends to grow unexpectedly - should use tools as they are meant to be used.

101906303781322750,Fri Aug 12 06:42:10 +0000 2011,I've had enough of laptops that don't resume from sleep and randomly freeze. I'm switching my laptop to mac.
