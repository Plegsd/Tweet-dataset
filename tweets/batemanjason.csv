19623909459,Tue Jul 27 02:57:04 +0000 2010,Been shooting HORRIBLE BOSSES for the last two weeks. This'll be worth more than your matinee money.
17678685056,Sat Jul 03 21:43:57 +0000 2010,Arnett, thanks for honoring my privacy.  What time's dinner tonight?
17548291019,Fri Jul 02 05:04:51 +0000 2010,Also, thanks for the kind words during my unexpected, unintended, thoroughly eye opening week's visit to Douchebag Land.

17378014796,Wed Jun 30 01:34:33 +0000 2010,@Alyssa_Milano No biggie, gone soon. Unlike the pain from Sunday's loss. Hope you're good.
17367010332,Tue Jun 29 22:25:17 +0000 2010,Correction- If there were boos, I didn't hear them. If some were mad, I didn't see them. I wish I had. If you're out there, I'm sorry.
17198830063,Sun Jun 27 22:28:19 +0000 2010,There wasn't one boo. Not one hiss. The Apple guy brought me in away from the paparazzi. Period. I was content in line. I wish I'd stayed.
16258434334,Tue Jun 15 22:11:21 +0000 2010,I think dumbdumb is up on Facebook now. Not sure what the hell good that is but I hope you guys'll show me.

15061993078,Sun May 30 20:11:17 +0000 2010,@arnettwill seems very not right.   @serafinowicz is beyond skilled at iPhone Scrabble
14342555296,Thu May 20 05:31:27 +0000 2010,Shooting short #2 in the morning. Me playing "son", Jeffery Tambor playing "dad." Arnett's in London ☹. Wish I had a shirt with his smell.
13951405694,Fri May 14 02:46:10 +0000 2010,Will and I are still shooting our first DumbDumb spot with @evilhag and @harrachael, although we can't remember (cont) http://tl.gd/19ji0e
13934092218,Thu May 13 20:55:12 +0000 2010,Shot until 3:30am. More tonight. Me tie-tie. Worth it though. Arnett is a genius. I hope you all like it.
13868120979,Wed May 12 19:39:21 +0000 2010,Today Arnett and I shoot our first day on our first digital short from our ad agency, DumbDumb. Early June, they should be on the web.
13805705994,Tue May 11 19:42:14 +0000 2010,Arnett's pipes are so G-damn velvety on the GMC spots. He must gargle sand.
13803209480,Tue May 11 18:44:34 +0000 2010,Recording voice over commercials for Verizon. I've almost swollowed my tongue twice.
13729715554,Mon May 10 14:32:16 +0000 2010,Will Arnett and I are making three digital shorts for Wrigley! Very excited. Today we're scouting for a house to shoot in.
13712028413,Mon May 10 06:25:24 +0000 2010,@arnettwill does this mean it just goes to you?
13711600081,Mon May 10 06:11:48 +0000 2010,Good morning, England. It feels warm and safe against the bosoms of Mr. Pegg and Mr. Serafinowicz.
13711226863,Mon May 10 06:00:33 +0000 2010,Oh, I just need to adjust the setting that sends an email to me when someone joins me.  Moment, please...
