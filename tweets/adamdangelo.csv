793113097477075000,Mon Oct 31 15:31:12 +0000 2016,RT @davidbyttow: @adamdangelo many people don't have easy access to printers, so a few screenshots on your phone work pretty well too
792909343184216000,Mon Oct 31 02:01:33 +0000 2016,@danablankenhorn @moskov depends on how much the people affected by the outage skew toward Clinton (young people who rely on phones)
792890931112325100,Mon Oct 31 00:48:23 +0000 2016,Last Friday's attack should be enough evidence. Print out directions so you can vote/campaign without internet. https://t.co/aWruxEqMK8
792854523899367400,Sun Oct 30 22:23:43 +0000 2016,@davidbyttow anyway, regardless of the exact likelihood seems like we agree on the conclusion
792854333482160100,Sun Oct 30 22:22:58 +0000 2016,@davidbyttow it seems like if there was any reason to hold a 0-day it would be for an opportunity like this
792851145349750800,Sun Oct 30 22:10:18 +0000 2016,@davidbyttow another way to look at it is that the bug bounties they place never get to the scale of what nation states can afford
792851017578651600,Sun Oct 30 22:09:47 +0000 2016,@davidbyttow They cost something like $1M but the value to Russia etc to throw the election is far higher
792850973274218500,Sun Oct 30 22:09:37 +0000 2016,@davidbyttow interesting. why do you think Google is immune to 0 days?
792838851332939800,Sun Oct 30 21:21:27 +0000 2016,@moskov ideally, campaigns and the media should broadcast that message. But runs into complicated messaging about conspiracy theories etc
792838489431679000,Sun Oct 30 21:20:00 +0000 2016,@moskov everyone should make sure they're ready to vote without the internet that day...print directions out, save stuff locally, vote early
792814249999409200,Sun Oct 30 19:43:41 +0000 2016,Good chance of major internet attack Nov 8th. Many groups have the ability and incentive. Maps outage alone could easily skew the election.

784531226275278800,Fri Oct 07 23:09:54 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans yeah, I disagree with the overall conclusion, not just the details
784530899601854500,Fri Oct 07 23:08:37 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans 3. compute per dollar is way more efficient in server settings
784530725987057700,Fri Oct 07 23:07:55 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans 1. most of the phone cost isn't going to computation; 2. the phone is idle most of the time, but cloud servers are working
784529302020907000,Fri Oct 07 23:02:16 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans so that gets you to 4-8x
784529129622429700,Fri Oct 07 23:01:35 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans I think if you go out to 3B users the average is more like $100/year
784528988341465100,Fri Oct 07 23:01:01 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans the device lasts more than 1 year. I also think the average is below $200 if you look globally at all 3B users.
784527380815700000,Fri Oct 07 22:54:38 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans what are you using for the cost of the device?
784526929886150700,Fri Oct 07 22:52:50 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans @alec1a I think the real conclusion is that for data-heavy work, you want to move the computation to the data
784524223528202200,Fri Oct 07 22:42:05 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans Google makes $50B/year from say 1B users. So $50/user/year.
784523642608705500,Fri Oct 07 22:39:46 +0000 2016,@BenedictEvans where do you get 50-100x? I get more like 2-5x

665764360111833100,Sun Nov 15 05:32:47 +0000 2015,@KevinSimler yeah, I think in all cases the benefit of the signal needs to be greater than the amount by which it makes life harder
665763574942269400,Sun Nov 15 05:29:40 +0000 2015,@KevinSimler yeah. I think the only way to get a mostly honest signal is to have everyone waste a lot of resources making the sign
665763055083483100,Sun Nov 15 05:27:36 +0000 2015,@KevinSimler I think the "handicap" is the cost of having to produce the sign and carry it, which turns out to be expensive but worth it.
665762662819627000,Sun Nov 15 05:26:02 +0000 2015,@KevinSimler doesn't have to be expensive to produce an honest number as long as it's expensive to fake
665762478521880600,Sun Nov 15 05:25:18 +0000 2015,@KevinSimler I'm not sure about the terms. But I think of it like a fitness score number on a sign they have to carry around and can't fake.
665759627510845400,Sun Nov 15 05:13:59 +0000 2015,@KevinSimler I think you can view the tail as a signal that is hard to fake more than expensive. It carries information beyond the handicap.

618671926488109000,Wed Jul 08 06:44:16 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea my claim is that the number of useful mainstream applications where you could do this is very limited
618671766718656500,Wed Jul 08 06:43:38 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea your original statement was that you can make decentralized systems do what centralized ones can do.
618670699004084200,Wed Jul 08 06:39:23 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea woah, that is a totally different application. Who does the machine learning to rank the feed in that?

618669700877193200,Wed Jul 08 06:35:25 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea unlike Twitter, there are an unlimited number of other cachers that don't need to follow any rules
618667661644267500,Wed Jul 08 06:27:19 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea @muneeb something would be stored on the blockchain, correct?
618666407048278000,Wed Jul 08 06:22:20 +0000 2015,@muneeb @ryaneshea whatever is stored on the blockchain is going to have this issue. It's permanent, you can't enforce laws, you can't adapt
618664123472089100,Wed Jul 08 06:13:15 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea it's too slow, so then there are caches all over with no incentive to remove old stuff. No one can enforce a terms of service.
618663005635506200,Wed Jul 08 06:08:49 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea how do you design in practical deletion when everything is stored in public forever?
618661743019995100,Wed Jul 08 06:03:48 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea when there are clear alternatives with none of those downsides, like running the reddit software on a server paid for by the mods
618661556440535000,Wed Jul 08 06:03:03 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea it's not just about whether it's possible, it's about whether people want it with all the sacrifices that have to come with it
618660731987210200,Wed Jul 08 05:59:47 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea and they value that ability
618660665008390100,Wed Jul 08 05:59:31 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea you are really disconnected from mainstream users. In practice people can get stuff off the internet most of the time.
618660049192259600,Wed Jul 08 05:57:04 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea @muneeb you get the worst of both worlds, not the "at worst" property
618658789089108000,Wed Jul 08 05:52:04 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea @sama but with all the downsides of decentralization like speed and inflexibility
618658647678189600,Wed Jul 08 05:51:30 +0000 2015,@ryaneshea @sama who gets the power to reverse stuff? You're back to a centralized authority.
618658262125129700,Wed Jul 08 05:49:58 +0000 2015,@muneeb so again, if someone gets your password, you lose the account forever
618657901171728400,Wed Jul 08 05:48:32 +0000 2015,@adrianbye you can still get hacked (e.g. By a virus that listens to your keyboard input). And in this model you lose your account forever.
618657334064078800,Wed Jul 08 05:46:17 +0000 2015,@muneeb what goes on the "control plane"?
618656540568916000,Wed Jul 08 05:43:08 +0000 2015,It's much better for marginalized subreddits to just move to other centralized platforms than to try to make it fully decentralized.
618656242492293100,Wed Jul 08 05:41:56 +0000 2015,For example, if Twitter was implemented on it, and you lost your password, you could never get your account back. No deleting old tweets.
618656012531138600,Wed Jul 08 05:41:02 +0000 2015,I'm not optimistic about the use of the blockchain for anything mainstream besides bitcoin. It has bad properties like irreversibility.
