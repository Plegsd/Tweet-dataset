663233245669032000,Sun Nov 08 05:55:02 +0000 2015,@_teaplease Latina females really identify with Beyoncé so there are two aspects. In India I am guessing even Chopra’s fans are male skewed
663233006501400600,Sun Nov 08 05:54:05 +0000 2015,@_teaplease using feminism India won’t really help the brand because few people understand it.

663230794131902500,Sun Nov 08 05:45:18 +0000 2015,@_teaplease doesn’t make business sense to identify as feminist when you are trying to be part of another culture.
