860135210138120200,Thu May 04 14:13:09 +0000 2017,That's on them to answer. It's on us to hold them to account. Let's make today a moment we can look back and be proud of .
860134855052492800,Thu May 04 14:11:44 +0000 2017,but to put your careers on the line for something that doesn't provide access to millions more, or protects people with preexist...why?
860134560318840800,Thu May 04 14:10:34 +0000 2017,Republicans are going to pay the price of this vote. You're seeing the same groundswell (and mistakes) we saw in 2010.
860134323147722800,Thu May 04 14:09:37 +0000 2017,I still remember seeing the results come in and watching offices of my best friends fall to defeat. But all for the right reasons.
860134108281933800,Thu May 04 14:08:46 +0000 2017,Those of us who put our hearts into that bill paid the price. If passage was my best day, Election Night 2010 was my worst - by far.
860133945794494500,Thu May 04 14:08:07 +0000 2017,but the day we passed the ACA was the best of my professional career. We knew it was the right thing. Perfect? No, but it had to be done.
860133680546803700,Thu May 04 14:07:04 +0000 2017,and that debate was ugly - I've never had harder days than watching my boss yelled at by constituents she was just trying to help
860133472798724100,Thu May 04 14:06:15 +0000 2017,but once we got there, the debate for ACA was seemingly never ending. Caucus meetings, district events, etc. All encompassing.
860133236600692700,Thu May 04 14:05:18 +0000 2017,remember, we did ARRA and cap &amp; trade before we touched the ACA - those bills salted the earth before we could even plant the seed for ACA
