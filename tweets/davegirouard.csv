631199461390159900,Tue Aug 11 20:24:13 +0000 2015,6/ with this restructure, Larry is setting proper expectations for shareholders. What more could you ask for?

631198339720065000,Tue Aug 11 20:19:45 +0000 2015,5/ If you dislike taking profits spun off from core &amp; investing in big risky bets isn't for you, don't own this stock.

631197892313661400,Tue Aug 11 20:17:59 +0000 2015,3/ If you didn't like all authority in Larry/Sergey's hands, this doesn't change that. But improves visibility into performance of core.
631197659093577700,Tue Aug 11 20:17:03 +0000 2015,For other alphabet co's, Larry/Sergey decide on capital allocation. CEOs operate largely independently (modern day Berkshire Hathaway)
631197457825710100,Tue Aug 11 20:16:15 +0000 2015,2/ For core Google, things get better because @sundarpichai is immensely talented, and will now have authority to make clear decisions
631197230645448700,Tue Aug 11 20:15:21 +0000 2015,1/ Alphabet is a great move because it aligns the org structure w/ how the company actually works today.
631196877375934500,Tue Aug 11 20:13:57 +0000 2015,@jyarow I disagree. CEOs won't naturally have  lots of interaction - independent businesses. Larry decides who gets what $$. I like it.
