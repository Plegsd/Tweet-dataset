603937191279005700,Thu May 28 14:53:41 +0000 2015,@SamWalterTweets Yes. Depends on your camera and lights, too, but custom white balance and exposure set with a gray card might do it.

601031357955899400,Wed May 20 14:26:57 +0000 2015,@calebpike True. In that case less pricey monitors may be a better choice for GH4 shooters. Do you ever use the mic pres on Shogun?
600826650616434700,Wed May 20 00:53:30 +0000 2015,@calebpike definitely agree on the image quality. There are the benefits of editing with ProRes for smooth editing and the exposure tools.

555875553907982340,Thu Jan 15 23:53:54 +0000 2015,@homydesign looks like a decent amount of output but color is usually hard to correct on lights in this price range. Will need to diffuse.
555870370532556800,Thu Jan 15 23:33:18 +0000 2015,@homydesign Hmm, can't seem to find the maker's website. No TLCI or CRI rating. Probably not natural color but would love to test them out!

555488947921379300,Wed Jan 14 22:17:40 +0000 2015,@theRamenNoodle Try gaffers tape first and see how that goes. The advantage of gaff tape is that it can be used for a lot of other things.

551755351129735200,Sun Jan 04 15:01:41 +0000 2015,@theRamenNoodle mostly boom mics. Rode NT5 with a custom capsule, AT4053B, or SM58 for voice over.
551604337680461800,Sun Jan 04 05:01:37 +0000 2015,@theRamenNoodle Ideally, two boom mics but lavs can work if you prefer. Boom mics are often better for people that don't know mic technique.
551258293339844600,Sat Jan 03 06:06:33 +0000 2015,@theRamenNoodle No, I have a confession to make: I only use lavalier mics when I absolutely must. I almost always boom a hypercardioid mic.

551253617722683400,Sat Jan 03 05:47:58 +0000 2015,@theRamenNoodle In terms of sound quality, I prefer the MicJ 044 recorded into a Zoom H1 better.
