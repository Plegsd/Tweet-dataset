692795451708444700,Thu Jan 28 19:44:41 +0000 2016,@lightskinttruth @bobatl and I was thinking about it in that kind of orbital terms. My bad. You win that point

692036981233184800,Tue Jan 26 17:30:48 +0000 2016,@Officer1002 @bobatl I'd say that's a pretty distinct curvature -- look how far the clouds slope away from the red line on the right

691732873938890800,Mon Jan 25 21:22:23 +0000 2016,@bobatl the top image actually DOES show a slight curve - look under that red line your drew and note the distance of the clouds to the line

690234529345376300,Thu Jan 21 18:08:30 +0000 2016,@fok1010 I'm also not asking you to take it off -- Twitter is clearly a place for discourse. You post opinionated things, responses happen
690234288470646800,Thu Jan 21 18:07:32 +0000 2016,@fok1010 to your pt, then, there are likely other issues in those cities more connected to the murder rates than gun control laws

690230204317503500,Thu Jan 21 17:51:19 +0000 2016,@fok1010 not gonna try to argue 2A, just saying that image is false information.
690229998653931500,Thu Jan 21 17:50:30 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ many women also don't like trump, vehemently, is my point.
690229933579358200,Thu Jan 21 17:50:14 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ ... That's fair, but this started when I pointed to someone making a group statement about women... Which you just echoed.
690228384190861300,Thu Jan 21 17:44:05 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ how are women not a group? And what you just said is kinda my point...
690228209389047800,Thu Jan 21 17:43:23 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ basically, I think the idea "women love Trump" is a general falsehood
690227997253697500,Thu Jan 21 17:42:33 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ I absolutely think I can stand up for women's opinions and rights, but it's not my place to say "all women want X"
690227752142770200,Thu Jan 21 17:41:34 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ I'm saying one person can't give the opinion of an entire group they're not a part of, at least not in fair political discourse
690226971536724000,Thu Jan 21 17:38:28 +0000 2016,@fok1010 actually, U.S. Virgin Islands is 3rd by rate, U.S. is 121 -- by count, we're 11th, is the issue
690225828001620000,Thu Jan 21 17:33:55 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ missed point -- reason I made comment in first place is larger than man/woman
690223962052268000,Thu Jan 21 17:26:30 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ Didn't specify women there.
690223292322545700,Thu Jan 21 17:23:51 +0000 2016,@moondroid_ Mean :( My thought was 1 person speaking for the opinion of a group they aren't a part of feels like false generalizing to me
690223014307328000,Thu Jan 21 17:22:44 +0000 2016,@FashyNeko Fair point. I just think an individual speaking of the approval of a demographic he isn't a part of is false generalizing
690222157230665700,Thu Jan 21 17:19:20 +0000 2016,@keksec__org ah, it's an abbreviation for a word, true. Wouldn't work in a game of scrabble, all i'm saying
690220991449075700,Thu Jan 21 17:14:42 +0000 2016,@MrPaulTown @keksec__org and nothing says "Make America Great Again" than pointing to someone's location in America as a reason for mockery.
