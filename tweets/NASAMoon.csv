679736976862482400,Wed Dec 23 18:54:58 +0000 2015,RT @NASA: Full moon this Christmas is very rare. The last time was 1977, &amp; the next time will be 2034: https://t.co/1sjrKNPfDR https://t.co‚Ä¶
677530641123156000,Thu Dec 17 16:47:47 +0000 2015,We‚Äôre using these findings to build new models of how the space environment interacts with the surfaces of airless bodies.
677529949759275000,Thu Dec 17 16:45:02 +0000 2015,Since these processes are ubiquitous across the solar system, knowledge about the moon can be applied to a range of other bodies.
677529574855581700,Thu Dec 17 16:43:33 +0000 2015,The frequent readings from LADEE revealed gas level rise as meteor streams hit the moon, with levels returning to normal after the stream.
677529103860424700,Thu Dec 17 16:41:40 +0000 2015,Interplanetary grains hit the moon at speeds exceeding 21 mi/s, releasing immense heat and vaporizing soil and the meteoroids themselves.
677528352626970600,Thu Dec 17 16:38:41 +0000 2015,Our new data show that meteoroid strikes cause a predictable increase in the abundance of two key elements within the lunar exosphere.
677528201770483700,Thu Dec 17 16:38:05 +0000 2015,An exosphere is the thin layer of gas surrounding a small body (the moon's is one 25-trillionth the density of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere)
