746778766249177100,Sat Jun 25 18:55:07 +0000 2016,@Airtel_Presence I'm paying for 40; getting 0.06. I get ~100 times this speed through my Vodafone cellular network. https://t.co/ohl77UMHaM
746777959583916000,Sat Jun 25 18:51:54 +0000 2016,@Airtel_Presence thanks for your response. After you promised to look into it, the speed has reduced to 0.06 Mbps (I'm paying for 40).
