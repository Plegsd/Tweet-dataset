367759030871011300,Wed Aug 14 21:26:00 +0000 2013,@Sethumadhavan thanks yaar :) but don't let our POV bias you any way. I don't know if this Gen would like Dharma, Jugnu, etc. Their loss :)
367754491460067300,Wed Aug 14 21:07:57 +0000 2013,@Sethumadhavan worked for both Sriram &amp; me. Sure some hiccups but overall closest to the genre as I knew it :) won't critique, you watch :)
367753426328764400,Wed Aug 14 21:03:44 +0000 2013,@Sethumadhavan hope you like it :) think you will - since you know that Time &amp; Genre it's Homaging. Of course, tastes differ. Curious :)
367751921375150100,Wed Aug 14 20:57:45 +0000 2013,@Sethumadhavan different take on the mentor-protege relationship. I think this is a much tougher script to write and direct personally.
367751457665069060,Wed Aug 14 20:55:54 +0000 2013,@DsouzaJennifer no :) worked for me. Goodnight üëç
367750438839255040,Wed Aug 14 20:51:51 +0000 2013,OUATIMD 3: This is among the closest to the real 70s 'commercial' cinema, the stuff I grew up on as a front bencher kid in that time üëç
367749821479657500,Wed Aug 14 20:49:24 +0000 2013,OUATIMD 2: Superbly helmed by Milan Luthria, with Rajat Aroraa's rat-a-tat dialogues. Akshay, Imran, Sonakshi have  a blast into the past.
367749238257905660,Wed Aug 14 20:47:05 +0000 2013,Loved OUATIMD. An uninhibited full on romp into Real Retro, balances emotion, camp, melodrama, &amp; 'highlights' that defined the 70s. (Contd)
