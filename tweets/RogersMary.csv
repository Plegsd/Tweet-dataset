25842074124,Wed Sep 29 01:53:48 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ The criteria is simply if we think we can help by escalating to OOP. For iPhone, it doesn't b/c they don't have any stock either.
25841982412,Wed Sep 29 01:52:42 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ Some stores are doing that to help manage the limited stock coming in.
25841198967,Wed Sep 29 01:43:12 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ However, when it comes to iPhone 4 we're limited in what can be done b/c of the stock levels we've received from the manufacturer.
25841133785,Wed Sep 29 01:42:22 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ No, not really. We're meant to compliment them. I also have different escalation paths available to me.
25841080908,Wed Sep 29 01:41:43 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ You are following me know, right? Oddly my Twitter client is not letting me DM. It knows I'm supposed to be offline :P
25840901639,Wed Sep 29 01:39:37 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ My team is trying to make it easier for custs to do biz w/ us. I hear your frustration & will try to provide you w/ info as I can.
25840337736,Wed Sep 29 01:32:21 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Thanks Sebastien :-)
25840108541,Wed Sep 29 01:29:28 +0000 2010,@Conner_G Thx Conner. I'm following you now so plz DM your phone number.
25839944156,Wed Sep 29 01:27:27 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ In terms of retentions, that I can't answer b/c I don't know. Can you follow me so we can DM?
25839829574,Wed Sep 29 01:26:03 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ You will be able to order when it becomes available, same time as new customers. You already have an existing acct on file.
25839752617,Wed Sep 29 01:25:05 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ If Care told you you could preorder, then I do apologize b/c that's not the case. I will look into having that corrected.
25839679152,Wed Sep 29 01:24:09 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ You ask some good Qs but first let me explain that we're not customer care, just here to help were we can. Which I can try 2 do :)
25839530548,Wed Sep 29 01:22:21 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Did you make any recent changes to your account? If not, have a look again tomorrow, if same, call Care to confirm. Let me know.
25839469694,Wed Sep 29 01:21:36 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Agh! So sorry, I keep reading my previous tweet, which was obviously wrong to start with.
25835584674,Wed Sep 29 00:33:37 +0000 2010,@Conner_G Hi Conner, this is Mary. If you can DM us the name on your acct and a # to contact you, we can escalate this tomorrow.
25835266924,Wed Sep 29 00:29:38 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Hi Kyle. Unfortunately, I don't have access to your acct so can't look in to that. Where did you get the info...Care or Online?
25835099902,Wed Sep 29 00:27:34 +0000 2010,@JamesWilk Thanks for the referral James. We'll try to help him out.
25835068546,Wed Sep 29 00:27:11 +0000 2010,@eplatero Hi Edward, I can try to help here. If you follow me, I'll send you an email address where you can explain the details of the issue
25834873828,Wed Sep 29 00:24:49 +0000 2010,@JasonWQ Jason, is there a particular problem that I can help you with?
25834000332,Wed Sep 29 00:10:51 +0000 2010,@jorybrodkin Hi Jory, have you called your local store or a local Apple store? I'd suggest you give them a try tomorrow.
25809826459,Tue Sep 28 18:42:29 +0000 2010,@cdnmusic Great to hear. Thanks Cody!
25786392001,Tue Sep 28 13:55:00 +0000 2010,@joyce_poon Hi Joyce, can you follow me please so we can DM? Thanks.
25785087162,Tue Sep 28 13:39:29 +0000 2010,@cdnmusic Cody!!! My apologies, I just saw your DM with contact details. I will escalate immediately & ask that they call you today.
25784822549,Tue Sep 28 13:36:29 +0000 2010,@StephenRLee Hey Stephen, I agree this sounds like an unusual problem. But, you need to call Care first b4 I can assist. Let me know.
25784703792,Tue Sep 28 13:35:04 +0000 2010,@cindy_hsiao Great to hear! If you need assistance in future, let us know & we'll try to help, though Care is always best place to start.
25736000129,Tue Sep 28 00:13:16 +0000 2010,@iPhoneinCanada Hi Gary, I'm not aware of anything. If customers are having issues, they really should call Tech Support to open a ticket.
25733306958,Mon Sep 27 23:40:04 +0000 2010,@ScottJohnson48 Let me know if you don't hear back by tomorrow and perhaps we'll need to escalate.
25721720248,Mon Sep 27 21:15:31 +0000 2010,@ScottJohnson48 Did they give a time frame to call back? There could be a # of factors so logging ticket is best way. Let me know how goes.
25720421276,Mon Sep 27 20:57:00 +0000 2010,@ScottJohnson48 Hey Scott - I have a question back for you. Did you call Tech Support to report a service issue?
25720276010,Mon Sep 27 20:54:53 +0000 2010,@paulbryden Hi Paul. Let me check... I'll get back to you.
25720005071,Mon Sep 27 20:50:57 +0000 2010,@booobear66 Hi Lori, have you called Technical Support? They can help you with that as well.
25637507390,Mon Sep 27 00:16:11 +0000 2010,@mamakasss Again, I apologize for the delay and will be sure to pass your feedback along internally. Glad to hear your problem was solved!
25637455676,Mon Sep 27 00:15:31 +0000 2010,@JuliaWBlack Hi Julia. I can't assist via Twitter, you will need to call Customer Care 1-888-ROGERS1 (764-3771). They are open.
25637335000,Mon Sep 27 00:13:58 +0000 2010,@young_adam When are you leaving Adam?
25635532551,Sun Sep 26 23:50:35 +0000 2010,@Affan Hi Affan, I'm not sure. Have you called Tech Support?
25635493624,Sun Sep 26 23:50:05 +0000 2010,@mamakasss Hi Kasandra - I'm sorry to hear about that! Did you call back in?
25635415121,Sun Sep 26 23:49:04 +0000 2010,@young_adam How much data do you think you'll need?
25635340361,Sun Sep 26 23:48:05 +0000 2010,@young_adam Hmm, I'm not sure what else to suggest Adam. Sorry I can't be more helpful but those are probably the best plans.
25632514177,Sun Sep 26 23:11:17 +0000 2010,@young_adam I don't have access to any special rates or promotions. Did Care suggest the best option for you?
25631770992,Sun Sep 26 23:01:32 +0000 2010,@young_adam Hi Adam. Sorry, I'm not really working today just checking in. What's the situation?
25625586643,Sun Sep 26 21:31:31 +0000 2010,@gisuck You could always check out Rogers On Demand or Rogers On Demand Online :-D Hope you're enjoying your day Jason!!
25625384818,Sun Sep 26 21:28:23 +0000 2010,@young_adam Noooo.... there still in the best/quickest position to help you :)
25622914796,Sun Sep 26 20:51:44 +0000 2010,@MaRONie_ I believe you need to call customer care for that.
25622587261,Sun Sep 26 20:46:49 +0000 2010,@softsign Hi Paulie - Did you call Customer Care?
25622351196,Sun Sep 26 20:43:12 +0000 2010,@devonanne Hi Devon, that's a standard fee on all activations and should be outlined in the agreement. You'll need to discuss w/ Care.
25600286729,Sun Sep 26 15:38:24 +0000 2010,@The_Real_Alyssa Have a look at our blog post: http://redboard.rogers.com/2010/rogers-offers-handset-protection-guarantee/
25600264674,Sun Sep 26 15:38:09 +0000 2010,@The_Real_Alyssa Hi Alyssa, it is covered under the handset protection guarentee. You will need to call Customer Care to discuss options.
25596856346,Sun Sep 26 14:59:04 +0000 2010,@young_adam Hey Adam, keep me posted. If you can't get through today I'll escalate what needs to be done, see what we can do.
25596565682,Sun Sep 26 14:55:40 +0000 2010,@d_phrase Ok, let me know how it goes. They've done that for me in the past and it worked great.
25589337399,Sun Sep 26 13:24:23 +0000 2010,@CharissaLam When the Torch releases, I should be able to answer some questions if you have any at that time. Let me know what you decide!
25589302944,Sun Sep 26 13:23:55 +0000 2010,@CharissaLam I'd suggest reading up on each online...some great articles about the diff b/w the two. FYI Wave has some reviews on rogers.com
25589133437,Sun Sep 26 13:21:36 +0000 2010,@puleen Thanks Puleen. Enjoy your Sunday.
25588937206,Sun Sep 26 13:18:47 +0000 2010,@d_phrase Hi  Dave, I haven't heard that one b4. Have you call Tech Support? Alternatively, power the box off and unplug, replug, power on.
25588775599,Sun Sep 26 13:16:26 +0000 2010,@ScottJohnson48 Let me see if I can find some answers for you. I'll get back to you tomorrow.

25535286280,Sat Sep 25 22:17:04 +0000 2010,@scottmckillop Okay, I'll ask around on Monday.
25535250097,Sat Sep 25 22:16:28 +0000 2010,@pixeladdikt Hi Greg, most have an upgrade path. We've been working w/ the manufacturers to ensure they know the importance of this.
25535198265,Sat Sep 25 22:15:38 +0000 2010,@gregmcmillan I'm not aware. Have you tried tech support?

25450633464,Sat Sep 25 00:00:09 +0000 2010,@convertingcopy Sorry for the frustration, we have been receiving limited stock from the manufacturer.

25450286519,Fri Sep 24 23:55:15 +0000 2010,@joyce_poon Hi Joyce, I think this is something we can help with. If you DM me your phone #/name on account, I can escalate.
25440039262,Fri Sep 24 21:25:54 +0000 2010,@5fifty5 Opps, sorry. That last tweet was from me :)
25436973410,Fri Sep 24 20:39:41 +0000 2010,@ajacob24 Hi Adam - You may want to call Tech Support.
25436196273,Fri Sep 24 20:27:39 +0000 2010,@cdnmusic I'll just need you to DM me your full name and contact #. You should hear from them by Monday.
25436160893,Fri Sep 24 20:27:06 +0000 2010,@cdnmusic Let me put you in touch w/ our Office of the President so you can talk it out with them. Okay?
25435073855,Fri Sep 24 20:10:26 +0000 2010,@visionjinx We don't have the info on the OS for that just yet. Stay tuned for launch.
25434973850,Fri Sep 24 20:08:54 +0000 2010,@rec3141 Hello. We have different plans depending on need/use. If you can provide me with details, I'll try to suggest a plan that works 4U.
25431964528,Fri Sep 24 19:22:48 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 I really don't know how long testing takes, it really depends on how it goes. We will try to get it out asap.
25431885075,Fri Sep 24 19:21:36 +0000 2010,@visionjinx Glad you like it :)
25431859167,Fri Sep 24 19:21:12 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 The process to add new/existing customers to the form is different and can't calculate HUP prior to launch.
25431640312,Fri Sep 24 19:17:54 +0000 2010,@cdnmusic Hi Cody. Can you provide me with some specifics about your situation? What are you trying to do?
25431536173,Fri Sep 24 19:16:19 +0000 2010,@ReeseA59 Yup, inventory levels should be be normal for this launch.
25431297203,Fri Sep 24 19:12:43 +0000 2010,@TheDaveCA With limited shipments coming in, not all stores in all locations are receiving inventory.
25409621645,Fri Sep 24 14:39:04 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 It will require testing to ensure it's certified to work on the network. It depends on what comes out of that.
25408176297,Fri Sep 24 14:22:29 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS HUP eligibility is based on your account at day of launch so customers can easily call in to order at that time.
25403848280,Fri Sep 24 13:31:20 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS Hi Michael, existing customers will be able to order at launch. I saw your blog post and will also answer some of your Qs there.
25339563113,Thu Sep 23 20:32:52 +0000 2010,@naschmid Hi Nicholas, we don't have it yet but LG confirmed we would by Oct at which time we will need to test.
25339471478,Thu Sep 23 20:31:38 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 Hi Don. So we did confirm that LG expects to get the OS to us by October.
25338294805,Thu Sep 23 20:16:06 +0000 2010,@DevinH1215 But when you say "different story" what do you mean exactly?
25338267987,Thu Sep 23 20:15:46 +0000 2010,@DevinH1215 Unfortunately, I don't have insight into retentions. With limited stock from the manufacturer, I understand your frustration.
25327289952,Thu Sep 23 17:36:34 +0000 2010,@blackheron Hi Martin, fyi that we've been informed the Canadian launch of the BlackBerry Torch 9800 has been changed to September 30.

25304089477,Thu Sep 23 12:54:45 +0000 2010,@DevinH1215 Hi Devin. Have you tried a local Apple store? They have more stock and can activate there as well.

24844024973,Sat Sep 18 12:23:51 +0000 2010,@accophox Hi Acco. What seems to be the issue? I'm not aware of any problems in that area. Best to cal Tech Support.
24843963769,Sat Sep 18 12:22:45 +0000 2010,@Rossco252 Hi Ross, this is Mary. Inventory shipments continue to be limited... we suggest you call a store beforehand.

24662226482,Thu Sep 16 13:11:10 +0000 2010,@paulstickney It's still saying that? If you could DM me your full name and account number, I'll have someone look into it.
24662161729,Thu Sep 16 13:10:18 +0000 2010,@visionjinx Oh, thanks for letting me know. No. I don't have a Buzz account myself.

24512567506,Tue Sep 14 22:03:29 +0000 2010,@ryanmmoore It should be, unless you rooted the device. Give Tech Support a call and let me know how it goes.
24512523712,Tue Sep 14 22:02:55 +0000 2010,@vmat14 Server was back up today.

24473503525,Tue Sep 14 13:07:29 +0000 2010,Hi @IWMOPS. FYI, the HTC server is back online.
24409767686,Mon Sep 13 19:41:00 +0000 2010,@parthdoshi88 Hi Parth. I wouldn't know the anwser to that, best to check with HTC.
24409694617,Mon Sep 13 19:39:50 +0000 2010,@mmathieum You'll need to ask Motorola about that? It's up to them to provide us with the OS.
24409595759,Mon Sep 13 19:38:11 +0000 2010,@woodenskull80 Hey Woody. HTC server is currently down for maintenance.
24407058927,Mon Sep 13 18:56:29 +0000 2010,@stocks_geo Unfortunately, I don't know for sure. Best to ask HTC.
24399439578,Mon Sep 13 17:01:57 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS Yes, that's the same info I've received. There's been no change to the roll out plan.
24390835104,Mon Sep 13 15:12:18 +0000 2010,@vmat14 I think the server's down 4 maint. but when up, try: Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Software Update Check &gt; then check manually.
24390665200,Mon Sep 13 15:10:17 +0000 2010,@samsonmar We are receiving limited quantities from the manufacturer.
24390587693,Mon Sep 13 15:09:22 +0000 2010,@kefirnet Not sure... it's probably a question best directed to HTC.
24390546414,Mon Sep 13 15:08:53 +0000 2010,@rhu6ar6 Hey Dan. You'll need to ask HTC magic about that.
24390360551,Mon Sep 13 15:06:42 +0000 2010,@DustinPaterson Hi Dustin. Don't know how it works overseas but the HTC server is temporarily down for maintenance.
24390200033,Mon Sep 13 15:04:52 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS @visionjinx HTC server maintenance. It will be back.
24390144649,Mon Sep 13 15:04:14 +0000 2010,@SK8Wireless It is but the server is currently having maintenance done by HTC. Plz be patient and sorry about that.
24390064444,Mon Sep 13 15:03:18 +0000 2010,@sabualkaz Hi Saif. I believe HTC’s software server is currently down for maintenance.
24389894986,Mon Sep 13 15:01:25 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 Thanks Don.
24127520296,Fri Sep 10 18:25:01 +0000 2010,@mike1979 HTC is aware and investigating.
24125792152,Fri Sep 10 17:58:55 +0000 2010,@eganc Hi. HTC is looking in to the issue.
24116620026,Fri Sep 10 15:59:10 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 We usually add them to our download page, but this is OTA so it doesn't really have a "home". I'll have to ask about that :)
24115925308,Fri Sep 10 15:50:54 +0000 2010,@IAmTweetless You would have to ask HTC about those.
24115797417,Fri Sep 10 15:49:24 +0000 2010,@XjunkyMan Thanks for letting us know :)
24115646411,Fri Sep 10 15:47:37 +0000 2010,@TaxOnTime I will do that very soon but if you want to DM me your email, I'll send it to you.
24114591096,Fri Sep 10 15:35:14 +0000 2010,@jgrrr Can you follow me, please? It could take up to 14 days or I can send you the manual path.
24114471628,Fri Sep 10 15:33:50 +0000 2010,@myhiddenid Hi John, sorry I don't know how to help with rooted versions. Android Forums might be a good place for you to check out.
24111172619,Fri Sep 10 14:55:45 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 You mean the /magicsoftwarupdate link? It still needs to be there.... especially for folks who haven't updated yet.
24110452414,Fri Sep 10 14:47:08 +0000 2010,@bmxkelowna That's odd. You should post that to our Community Forum: http://communityforums.rogers.com
24110351464,Fri Sep 10 14:45:54 +0000 2010,@StephenWeppler Perhaps and email would be best for you in this case: www.rogers.com/contactus
24110279216,Fri Sep 10 14:45:03 +0000 2010,@StephenWeppler I am sorry for the trouble Stephen but there's nothing I can do directly in this case.
24110231155,Fri Sep 10 14:44:29 +0000 2010,@ChiefBroom I saw it:) But, we don't get the OS direct from Google, it's provided to us by the manufacturer. Ex. Sense UI is HTC specific.
24109925880,Fri Sep 10 14:40:48 +0000 2010,@rhu6ar6 As far as I know it's only OTA. Why would you need to do it over cable?

24012708658,Thu Sep 09 14:11:38 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS Entry level BB plans are priced differently because they are restricted to certain features and only compatible with BB service

23928852753,Wed Sep 08 16:31:04 +0000 2010,@ChiefBroom I don't know about that. But we typically don't comment on speculation.
23928724051,Wed Sep 08 16:29:30 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Have you checked with Best Buy or Future Shop?
23928703454,Wed Sep 08 16:29:14 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech We don't have the earphones on our website but a quick Google search came up with a few. I'll ask around internally.
23928198678,Wed Sep 08 16:22:57 +0000 2010,@playingdoh Do you have a specific app/device question?

23926889085,Wed Sep 08 16:07:13 +0000 2010,@SlydeDraco BTW, how much space do you currently have available? That would help me to know.
23926858087,Wed Sep 08 16:06:50 +0000 2010,@SlydeDraco I'll have to look into that Sean. You might want to reset your device and then try again.

22398369627,Sun Aug 29 01:22:03 +0000 2010,@traveling_mike I think you can but Care could confirm that for you. Or, if you can wait until Monday, I'll check with a colleague .

22397513947,Sun Aug 29 01:08:39 +0000 2010,@pewpewpew I think you can return that to any Rogers location and most should be open Sunday. Best to call ahead.
22386877295,Sat Aug 28 22:11:01 +0000 2010,@sharvansalooja Hi Sharvan. What seems to be the problem?

22386304910,Sat Aug 28 22:00:58 +0000 2010,@mathewkumar Could you provide me details of when you called in? I'll be sure this information is forwarded to our internal team for review.

22357731839,Sat Aug 28 14:41:21 +0000 2010,@kylerickson Hi Kyle, I think it's about $10 but a retail location would be able to confirm that for you.

22298324878,Fri Aug 27 21:08:04 +0000 2010,@lucywaverman Hi Lucy, this is Mary w/Rogers. I saw your tweet. What kind of issue are you having with your BB? Maybe I can help.
22298154862,Fri Aug 27 21:05:20 +0000 2010,@dieselboy28 It's a great idea but I can't discuss future releases until the may/may not become available. RU following RogersBuzz for news?
22298072245,Fri Aug 27 21:04:09 +0000 2010,@silvertoe BTW, thanks for tweeting your posts. It ensures I see them and know they're directed to me :-)
22298014895,Fri Aug 27 21:03:13 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Hey Kyle - I'll get back to you shortly on that....

22200863217,Thu Aug 26 18:47:02 +0000 2010,@TeeNathaniel ..report it as well as per the mod's suggestion? That would help get it on the record. I'll let you know what I find out. 2/2
22200564685,Thu Aug 26 18:42:01 +0000 2010,@TeeNathaniel It a Rogers phone, just new. So, I'll send this issue to our product team but, as well, could you please... 1/2
22193331027,Thu Aug 26 16:52:33 +0000 2010,@TeeNathaniel Did you check the serial number on the device as the mod suggested, or do the hard reset as per his instructions?
22190245417,Thu Aug 26 16:12:31 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Sorry about that Blair, not sure how that happened. I'm looking into it now and will let you know what I find out.
22181303210,Thu Aug 26 14:19:56 +0000 2010,@TeeNathaniel Hey there.... did you get some feedback from the forums?
22181187588,Thu Aug 26 14:18:26 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Blair, what province are you in?
22180652168,Thu Aug 26 14:11:31 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech By the way, third time you've asked us, the online comms team? That would be odd.
22178577117,Thu Aug 26 13:44:18 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech You might want to save that until I actually find an answer :-)
22120499618,Wed Aug 25 21:22:43 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Thanks. I'll look into that and get back to you.
22120110862,Wed Aug 25 21:16:45 +0000 2010,@lukec Hi Luke. You'll have to ask HTC that question.
22120020177,Wed Aug 25 21:15:21 +0000 2010,@cocopuffz No, don't think so.
22120000786,Wed Aug 25 21:15:04 +0000 2010,@IAmTweetless You'll need to talk to customer care about that.
22119877389,Wed Aug 25 21:13:08 +0000 2010,@ryanmmoore Plans should not change your eligibility to HUP but it depends on some factors. Best to check with Customer Care.
22119752869,Wed Aug 25 21:11:11 +0000 2010,@sajidmib This is an upgrade for Rogers, I'll direct the rest of your question to @HTC
22119002287,Wed Aug 25 20:59:41 +0000 2010,@5fifty5 Wow, I'll be sure to tell our internal team that. Thanks for the compliment :)
22118943155,Wed Aug 25 20:58:45 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Sorry Blair, I'm not sure what you mean. Can you clarify?
22118900089,Wed Aug 25 20:58:04 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS @ChillyEli Sorry, don't know the back story. What's up?
22028745380,Tue Aug 24 20:29:49 +0000 2010,@M_Sined Hi Denis, I never comment on future device launches but we do work closely with HTC.
22028319326,Tue Aug 24 20:22:49 +0000 2010,@thepuffytaco I'll pass along the feedback.
22014977930,Tue Aug 24 16:47:08 +0000 2010,@mor10 Yeah, possibly. I was thinking I'd go to where I've updated before but you raise a good point.
22014864633,Tue Aug 24 16:45:30 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Me too!!
22014824470,Tue Aug 24 16:44:56 +0000 2010,@M_Sined Thank you Denis :-) That's what our team is here for (though it's always nice to hear).
22014694431,Tue Aug 24 16:43:05 +0000 2010,@mosabua @mosabua Hmm, I don't know yet. I'll let you know as I know. But, I can say the 2.1 will be the last OS upgrade for this device.
22014577486,Tue Aug 24 16:41:25 +0000 2010,@chris_saunders This isn't a mandatory upgrade.
22014515062,Tue Aug 24 16:40:33 +0000 2010,@sean_cooper Interesting idea, I'll take it to the team! Thanks Sean :)
22013018478,Tue Aug 24 16:19:49 +0000 2010,@ryanmmoore Good question, I'll try to get you an answer in time for roll out.
22001987754,Tue Aug 24 13:51:47 +0000 2010,Hi Everyone. I have a Rogers Magic 2.1 OS upgrade update to share: http://cot.ag/cVuRZP
21792034034,Sun Aug 22 01:27:42 +0000 2010,@TeeNathaniel I have not but it sounds like a time zone issue (I'm guessing). Have you tried out our new tech forum? http://cot.ag/9qwLUm
21791912987,Sun Aug 22 01:25:40 +0000 2010,@urbanworkbench Hi Mike, sorry but that is not a supported service from Rogers.
21791731016,Sun Aug 22 01:22:39 +0000 2010,@LesaHannah I'd like to try to help if I can but need a few details. Did they give you a reason? If you'd prefer, we can DM or email.
21791633557,Sun Aug 22 01:21:02 +0000 2010,@polishmik Hi Mik, not that I've heard. Have you tried calling technical support?
21764416492,Sat Aug 21 17:14:54 +0000 2010,@IAmTweetless Hey James. Sorry, I don't have details on 2.2 just yet.
21764268991,Sat Aug 21 17:11:50 +0000 2010,@seanturvey I should have news to share next week.
21764218055,Sat Aug 21 17:11:04 +0000 2010,@felixHcat Thanks for your feedback. I'll share it with the internal team. Have you seen the X10? I love that one... camera is amazing.
21763867124,Sat Aug 21 17:05:49 +0000 2010,@LesaHannah Hi Lesa. Can you provide me with some additional details? What happened and store location.
21686948156,Fri Aug 20 18:51:00 +0000 2010,@mor10 Thks for sharing that link. I was surprised to see that rumour but it's not the case. I should have an update early next wk.
21662768877,Fri Aug 20 13:07:18 +0000 2010,@slc334 I'd be more surprised than you! I won't share exact dates until I have them confirmed.
21545622824,Thu Aug 19 03:26:35 +0000 2010,@daleberg Dale! So sorry, I missed your tweet. We're limitig to in-store until inventory is in better shape. We'll keep you posted.
21545394365,Thu Aug 19 03:23:12 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Isn't it great when you get to work at what you love to do? Everyone should be a geek :-D
21545337034,Thu Aug 19 03:22:20 +0000 2010,@jctremblay For security reasons, your client will need to confirm that information with the Rogers contact they are dealing with.
21545248378,Thu Aug 19 03:21:02 +0000 2010,@noreallyitsme RedBoard is fairly new and we're working to better communicate with our store level.
21545200529,Thu Aug 19 03:20:19 +0000 2010,@noreallyitsme Our team does not have account information so Care is your best place to start. We try to help where we can.
21429418799,Tue Aug 17 20:05:30 +0000 2010,@AndroidChris I should have more details to share soon. Are you following RogersBuzz?
21429379957,Tue Aug 17 20:04:50 +0000 2010,@jctremblay Would that be a Rogers client? It's a trademarked logo.
21429122569,Tue Aug 17 20:00:22 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Just a little-bit like a geek :-P Kind of like me, everyday!
21428946926,Tue Aug 17 19:57:27 +0000 2010,@irfworks I don't even know when :-) Coming weeks... we'll keep you posted! Are you following RogersBuzz?
21349889417,Mon Aug 16 22:23:16 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Hi Blair - Working to get an answer to that. I'll tweet when I know for sure.
21349861359,Mon Aug 16 22:22:49 +0000 2010,@slc334 Hopefully, soon.
21349837728,Mon Aug 16 22:22:27 +0000 2010,@puleen Sorry, I missed that network/device conversation. What was the context?
21349674077,Mon Aug 16 22:19:57 +0000 2010,@greenwooddavis Hi Heather. Glad to hear it... let me know when you get the new phone. Would love to hear your review!
21349499000,Mon Aug 16 22:17:19 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS Me too!!! I'm working to confirm that. Stay tuned.... hang tight.
21349381420,Mon Aug 16 22:15:33 +0000 2010,@nowever Admittedly, I've been lagging. But all caught up now!!
21349347056,Mon Aug 16 22:15:03 +0000 2010,@jctremblay Well that's a question I've never had before! May take me some time to get the answer. Can I ask why you need it?
21349293280,Mon Aug 16 22:14:15 +0000 2010,@rdelaet Hi Robert, I work w/ Keith. Stores are doing their best to meet demand based on limited inventory. I don't have specific details.
21003556408,Thu Aug 12 20:35:28 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS @IAmTweetless Duly noted :-)
20803815638,Tue Aug 10 15:36:16 +0000 2010,@RuhnDMC Some stores did. I don't have specifics to which stores received stock. We're trying to provide updates here: http://cot.ag/bGZoOF
20716252765,Mon Aug 09 15:26:59 +0000 2010,@Kilprot Best I could suggest right now is to ask them once the device becomes available.
20716221464,Mon Aug 09 15:26:32 +0000 2010,@Kilprot Hmm. HUP is typically 24mnts but there's a promo now for iPhone4. Hard for me to know your eligibility will be for a diff device.
20705062471,Mon Aug 09 12:47:45 +0000 2010,@hsy Our team doesn't have access to account info. While we don't replace Care, we help were we can. Let me know if you run into an issue.
20673656448,Mon Aug 09 02:24:04 +0000 2010,@Kilprot I don't have access to your acct details but can you explain the situation to me a bit? When was the last HUP? What did Care say?
20673544029,Mon Aug 09 02:22:19 +0000 2010,@Mrballer That's great feedback. I'll absolutely pass that on.
20673407535,Mon Aug 09 02:20:13 +0000 2010,@davidfeeley Hi David. We can't discuss roll outs b4 they may/may not happen. But, I'll be sure the internal team gets your feedback.
20673296738,Mon Aug 09 02:18:29 +0000 2010,@hsy Have you had a chance to talk to someone in Customer Care about this? They'd be your best resource for account-related information.
20673176753,Mon Aug 09 02:16:38 +0000 2010,@hoofedblacky Hi there. We still don't have any information that we can share.

20651549310,Sun Aug 08 20:06:27 +0000 2010,@Mrballer Interesting. We can't control all content but what channel/program was it? I'll share that info with our internal team.
20651512378,Sun Aug 08 20:05:42 +0000 2010,@hsy Hey Harley. Is it an actual charge or line item?
20651489013,Sun Aug 08 20:05:15 +0000 2010,@Levisan Hi Levi, we apologize for any inconvenience. We're trying to keep customers informed as best we can. It's obviously not perfect.
20651148266,Sun Aug 08 19:58:42 +0000 2010,@Kilprot Hi Mark. Not yet.... but in the coming weeks. We'll definitely tweet the release through RogersBuzz :-)

20643827162,Sun Aug 08 17:38:00 +0000 2010,@steve_boyd Thanks great to know Steve. I'll pass that feedback along to the community moderator, Eryn. She'll love to hear it :)
20627811341,Sun Aug 08 13:20:36 +0000 2010,@TAYLORJONEZ You need to follow for DM. FYI, I may be offline for a bit of time. We don't usually work on weekends, I'm just popping in ;-)
20627159880,Sun Aug 08 13:08:52 +0000 2010,@somestyle Can you DM me a number where you can be reached? And the name on the account. I'll escalate this & see what I can do from my end.

20599578100,Sun Aug 08 03:30:11 +0000 2010,@EagleLooking78 That's not great to hear. Could you DM me the location of the store?

20589473224,Sun Aug 08 00:46:23 +0000 2010,@SteveatGoodLife Okay, if you have any further trouble please let me know.

20585934043,Sat Aug 07 23:43:13 +0000 2010,@Charlo1108 Hi Charlo. I have different means of escalation depending on the situation. It's totally up to you.

20572558341,Sat Aug 07 19:10:45 +0000 2010,@jameskrp Thanks for the suggestion James, we'll pass that along.
20572199658,Sat Aug 07 19:03:25 +0000 2010,@NickKnowsItAll Hi Nick. That's the best we have right now. Follow @RogersBuzz and we'll keep you posted :)

20550751932,Sat Aug 07 13:18:00 +0000 2010,@gizlau Thanks for letting me know! I'll work it out with her. Have a great weekend.
20550694544,Sat Aug 07 13:16:59 +0000 2010,@greenwooddavis Sure, plz follow me and we'll DM. Just FYI, I only pop in to twitter on weekends so response will be sporadic. Okay?
20549895893,Sat Aug 07 13:03:02 +0000 2010,@mor10 Sure! I'll DM you.
20549817229,Sat Aug 07 13:01:41 +0000 2010,@janolepeek Hi, Elise is out. Have you read our post on RedBoard? HUP depends on the date of your last upgrade: http://cot.ag/bGZoOF
20503963461,Fri Aug 06 22:38:20 +0000 2010,@iamunr Hey Paul. Try giving them a call in the morning. Also, I hear some Apple stores have stock.
20503916483,Fri Aug 06 22:37:30 +0000 2010,@EagleLooking78 Unfortunately, we don't.
20503855642,Fri Aug 06 22:36:26 +0000 2010,@robotvsunicorn Hi. Not sure, I don't know the details of the situation. Tech Support is the right place for that advice.
20500726935,Fri Aug 06 21:43:00 +0000 2010,@Stephanie_Ruth When is the last time you had an upgrade? I assume you talked to Customer Care... what did they say?
20500263120,Fri Aug 06 21:34:30 +0000 2010,@jessieincanada I hear ya. We’re trying to be as transparent as we can and sharing the best info we have from the manufacturer.
20500208955,Fri Aug 06 21:33:31 +0000 2010,@Charlo1108 Hi there, this is Mary with Rogers. Agree, that doesn't make sense. Can you tell me a bit a bit about what lead to this?
20499468742,Fri Aug 06 21:20:12 +0000 2010,@jessieincanada I wish I could, but I don't know. I'll be calling stores myself!
20497831094,Fri Aug 06 20:50:51 +0000 2010,@musiqueconcrete Hi Mike. You'll need to go into a Rogers/Apple store.
20497738370,Fri Aug 06 20:49:10 +0000 2010,@jonahhu Hi Jonah. You'll need to talk to Customer Care about this, we don't have access to your account details.
20497492696,Fri Aug 06 20:45:02 +0000 2010,@wraeyth Hey Matthew. I don't have any details on this. Was there a contact number on the email? Let me check with Elise.
20495502328,Fri Aug 06 20:09:34 +0000 2010,@mattske83 Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Good luck!
20495476216,Fri Aug 06 20:09:05 +0000 2010,@DarrinSearancke Funny :-) I wish I could be more helpful but best I can suggest is to call in the morning.
20494864737,Fri Aug 06 19:58:13 +0000 2010,@robschertzer Thanks for the feedback.
20494628525,Fri Aug 06 19:53:59 +0000 2010,@DarrinSearancke Hmmm, I'm not exactly sure how to respond to that! Do you have an Apple store nearby?

20494191240,Fri Aug 06 19:46:24 +0000 2010,@mattske83 Only Care or a store rep can tell you for sure.
20491801988,Fri Aug 06 19:05:16 +0000 2010,@vmach I don't right now but feel free to check back with me then!
20489159751,Fri Aug 06 18:21:30 +0000 2010,@mattske83 I really don't Matt, sorry. You could go talk to them in advance when it's not busy. Perhaps?
20489107390,Fri Aug 06 18:20:40 +0000 2010,@mikemacfarlane We have announced we will but I don't have more details than this right now: http://cot.ag/a9BOGd

20471006222,Fri Aug 06 14:01:27 +0000 2010,@robownage No idea. Have you tried asking Google? Seems odd.
20470965995,Fri Aug 06 14:00:53 +0000 2010,@jeffsidea Hey Jeff. Have you talked to someone in Technical Support? They should be able to help troubleshoot.

20470847407,Fri Aug 06 13:59:24 +0000 2010,@GerryClements How it appears for new custs has changed somewhat for clarity but existing custs have the option to keep existing plan.

20423396370,Fri Aug 06 00:11:54 +0000 2010,@snoble From what I've read online, I think that would be Google. I think :)

20310159114,Wed Aug 04 14:55:27 +0000 2010,@SuperJens Hi Jens. Still on track for end of month, as far as I'm aware.
20251205273,Tue Aug 03 21:25:54 +0000 2010,@martin8768 Hi Martin. We anticipate end of August. Stay tuned!
20250839828,Tue Aug 03 21:19:27 +0000 2010,@BrianDunphy Hi Brian. I just got back from vacation, glad to see your issue was resolved. Take care.
20060081322,Sun Aug 01 12:51:56 +0000 2010,@kongfactorial Sorry to hear that Krystle. Technical Support should be able to help troubleshoot.
19533837495,Mon Jul 26 00:56:40 +0000 2010,@Grabka Sorry - nothing we can share yet about hardware upgrades for iphone 4 I'm afraid.
19367285614,Fri Jul 23 20:40:24 +0000 2010,Hey All. I'll be out of the office until August 3 on tweetcation. If you need any assistance, please direct to @RogersHelps. Bye for now :-)
19362696748,Fri Jul 23 19:19:00 +0000 2010,@pluc The two are unrelated. We review usage & adjust to reflect our customer's online behaviour. We have multiple plans to choose from.
19362517671,Fri Jul 23 19:15:53 +0000 2010,@chris24 This ensures those w/ high demands have option to choose more speed/bw and those whose w/less need have lower priced tiers
19362428617,Fri Jul 23 19:14:21 +0000 2010,@chris24 I can't really comment on what carriers do in other countries but we review customer usage and make changes as need shows.
19362322881,Fri Jul 23 19:12:28 +0000 2010,@modfox There have been no changes to the Express tier, that remains the same.
19362245602,Fri Jul 23 19:11:06 +0000 2010,@tomcat335 In the last 5 yrs, we launched 2 new tiers, improved speeds & provided usage allowance to more accurately reflect customers needs
19362212353,Fri Jul 23 19:10:29 +0000 2010,@tomcat335 We regularly make adjustments to reflect the changing nature of customer's online behaviour..more options now to suit diff needs
19362012470,Fri Jul 23 19:06:58 +0000 2010,@laslow Of course, I hear what you're getting at. But, that is why we have so much choice including a tier up to 175GB
19359875699,Fri Jul 23 18:28:52 +0000 2010,@tomcat335 Changes are only to Lite and Express new accounts in Ontario. Customers have a wide choice of plans to suit their needs.
19359779623,Fri Jul 23 18:27:00 +0000 2010,@chris24 Hi Chris. FYI, this does not impact existing customers. Also, the two are unrelated.
19359744404,Fri Jul 23 18:26:18 +0000 2010,@StephenWeppler Hey Stephen. The two are unrelated and the changes are only for new customers, who have wide choice based on usage needs.
19359674773,Fri Jul 23 18:24:56 +0000 2010,@laslow This is for new customers only and the two things are unrelated.
19286121061,Thu Jul 22 21:48:00 +0000 2010,@5fifty5 Hi Charles, we can't rlse an OS update until it is made available to us by the manufacturer. We cont to work w/ them closely.
19284135253,Thu Jul 22 21:13:55 +0000 2010,@JamesWatch Hi James, just fyi, the new tiers are for new customers only. Your plan does not change.
19284004722,Thu Jul 22 21:11:42 +0000 2010,@ryanmmoore Hi Ryan. It's dependent on which device you're using and when the manufacturer makes it available. Which one do you have?
19283504862,Thu Jul 22 21:03:16 +0000 2010,@IAmTweetless Gotcha... I've seen that a few times today :-) I don't have info on 2.2 yet. 2.1 by end of Aug.
19283456756,Thu Jul 22 21:02:25 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS Will pass the article along!
19283425122,Thu Jul 22 21:01:52 +0000 2010,@MikePerry Hi Mike. I don't have any information on that yet.
19283383060,Thu Jul 22 21:01:09 +0000 2010,@clskb Yes! Text messaging is the same rate across Canada.
19270144524,Thu Jul 22 17:14:55 +0000 2010,@rossdunn Hi Ross. We're testing it now and anticipate it'll be ready for customers by end of August!
19106145382,Wed Jul 21 21:19:38 +0000 2010,@alexzandi Hi Alex. We will share pricing details as soon as possible. Thanks!
19105735407,Wed Jul 21 21:12:27 +0000 2010,@3rdpartym Hi Josh, I'm not entirely sure. Any particular reason you ask?
19105637264,Wed Jul 21 21:10:42 +0000 2010,@paulbryden Thanks for the link.
19094734572,Wed Jul 21 18:00:34 +0000 2010,@lance_ Thanks Lance. I'll share your feedback.
19094210528,Wed Jul 21 17:52:04 +0000 2010,@lance_ Sorry Lance, missed your last tweet. That's good feedback for me to share with the team. I thought there were more models available.
19093157584,Wed Jul 21 17:35:04 +0000 2010,@gregmcmillan Good question, I'm not entirely sure. Tech Support should be able to answer that.
19093086503,Wed Jul 21 17:33:56 +0000 2010,@TorontoWireless Currently, that pricing is specific for the iPad. Thanks for the f/b tough, I'll share that with the team.
19082534493,Wed Jul 21 14:58:06 +0000 2010,@TorontoWireless Also, it is not our policy to delete comments. As long as they meet the moderation guidelines, they are posted. Can I help?
19082472245,Wed Jul 21 14:57:13 +0000 2010,@TorontoWireless Hi Ray. We do not have data sharing plans available at this time. You can see here for info: http://cot.ag/bPt6qt
19073586984,Wed Jul 21 12:46:59 +0000 2010,@StephenRLee Glad to hear it was resolved!!
19017901790,Tue Jul 20 19:44:49 +0000 2010,@GuyFournier Ahhh! Info on that isn't available yet but will be available as soon as possible.
19017377190,Tue Jul 20 19:35:10 +0000 2010,@PartyOfOne Hmm. Perhaps email would be a better option for you, or calling Tech Support.
19017344088,Tue Jul 20 19:34:34 +0000 2010,@SwiitTweets Not for ultra-lite to extreme plus. Check out here for deets: http://www.rogers.com/web/link/hispeedBrowseFlowDefaultPlans
19015955951,Tue Jul 20 19:09:14 +0000 2010,@GuyFournier They should have emailed you back by now. Have you tried Live Chat or calling in? What's the issue, maybe I can help.
18992938974,Tue Jul 20 13:23:06 +0000 2010,@PartyOfOne Hard to say as I don't have access to that information. It would probably be worth a call to Care or trying out the Live Chat.
18991660670,Tue Jul 20 13:03:42 +0000 2010,@GilbertP23 Hi Gilbert, long time no tweet. Hope you're doing well :-) We will have info available as soon as possible! Thanks!!
18990600037,Tue Jul 20 12:47:07 +0000 2010,@sagaragrawal333 We expect it will be available to customers by end of August.
18990549819,Tue Jul 20 12:46:18 +0000 2010,@PartyOfOne Hi Alison. When you order online, it'll ask for your postal code info. Or you can try Live Chat: http://www.rogers.com/contactus
18990262504,Tue Jul 20 12:41:35 +0000 2010,@tobanm Hi Toban. Have you called Technical Support?

18944062348,Mon Jul 19 21:18:45 +0000 2010,@lance_ Hi Lance, we don't discuss future plans but thanks for the f/b. I'm curious though, what plan are you on currently?
18943481205,Mon Jul 19 21:07:42 +0000 2010,@mwickett Hi Mike, I work w/ Keith. We will share more info as soon as possible.
18943377981,Mon Jul 19 21:05:38 +0000 2010,@davidcrow That's good f/b David, thanks. Did you get this sorted out or do you need some help. Didn't reco you at 1st... like the new pix!
18936800444,Mon Jul 19 18:55:12 +0000 2010,@erin_bury Hi Erin. I believe Miranda is working with you on that one.
18928995361,Mon Jul 19 16:42:26 +0000 2010,@tomfromhr Yes, it should be. Who told you otherwise? FYI, their Twitter account is @Fidomobile :-)
18928925554,Mon Jul 19 16:41:21 +0000 2010,@GuyFournier Hi Guy. I'm not entirely sure but let me ask around and I'll get back to you.
18925312926,Mon Jul 19 15:47:05 +0000 2010,@DivaQBBQ Hi Danielle. Have you talked to customer care? What did they advise?
18925187124,Mon Jul 19 15:45:15 +0000 2010,@tomfromhr Hi Tom. No, the new term period starts immediately. It is not cumulative.
18925136323,Mon Jul 19 15:44:32 +0000 2010,@JCDunn Hi Jonathan. We're aware of the issues and are currently working on expanding our systems' capacity. Billing could help you w/ that.

18732516793,Sat Jul 17 02:01:28 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 ...and finally, regarding the bumpers, I don't have info on that yet. I'm surprised to see you ask a non-Android Q :-P
18732436455,Sat Jul 17 02:00:17 +0000 2010,@ronmason Hi Ron, I work with Keith. Nothing to share yet.

18716105238,Fri Jul 16 21:13:31 +0000 2010,@silentsim Sorry, I meant to say we don't carry them but I'll try to find out where to find one.
18716081124,Fri Jul 16 21:13:03 +0000 2010,@Andrew_GBtown Not sure but I can get back to you on Monday, once I ask around. Okay?
18716028411,Fri Jul 16 21:12:03 +0000 2010,@Sc0tasorusRex Thanks for the feedback.
18715907167,Fri Jul 16 21:09:47 +0000 2010,@silentsim That, I'm not sure about but I can ask around the office on Monday. Okay?
18715761756,Fri Jul 16 21:07:02 +0000 2010,@djbattaglia As soon as possible.
18715732552,Fri Jul 16 21:06:29 +0000 2010,@LongLegsTO Hi Sarah.... not yet.
18714116127,Fri Jul 16 20:36:17 +0000 2010,@kolcun Hi Mike. Can you email me further details like your phone number or account number so we can look into this further?
18711880145,Fri Jul 16 19:55:52 +0000 2010,@kolcun Thanks for letting us know Mike, we're looking into it.
18690160134,Fri Jul 16 14:33:35 +0000 2010,@Andrew_GBtown Where in the house do you use it most? I wonder if you need a booster.
18683580301,Fri Jul 16 13:01:06 +0000 2010,@Andrew_GBtown Have you talked to Technical Support about this?
18683546930,Fri Jul 16 13:00:40 +0000 2010,@footose Hi Harry, sorry I can't help with that.
18683413234,Fri Jul 16 12:58:49 +0000 2010,@ryestar Thanks for the tweet Ryan. We like "that guy" :-) I'll be sure to pass along your feedback.
18627949736,Thu Jul 15 20:07:19 +0000 2010,@DaveColeman Hi Dave. Can you follow me so I can DM?
18621054361,Thu Jul 15 18:08:30 +0000 2010,@josh_greenberg It's a good questions and I don't know the answer. I'll send the f/b to the team but I'll also ask around.
18620974438,Thu Jul 15 18:07:10 +0000 2010,@MatthewPatience @GreatBigDog01 @IWMOPS @pixeladdikt LOL. I was wondering about that ;-)
18620222686,Thu Jul 15 17:55:01 +0000 2010,@Andrew_GBtown Of course not :) What's your other question?
18620067994,Thu Jul 15 17:52:26 +0000 2010,@KowZ Thanks for sharing that with us.
18620034450,Thu Jul 15 17:51:52 +0000 2010,@irfworks I don't know the details of how that works. Tech Support can probably answer that one for you.
18619868072,Thu Jul 15 17:49:08 +0000 2010,@josh_greenberg Hey Josh. I've had this happen w/ some shows as well. I fix it by setting the end time a few minutes later. Works great :)
18619778343,Thu Jul 15 17:47:39 +0000 2010,@footose If only. What's that saying about power corrupts? LOL.
18612320739,Thu Jul 15 15:55:50 +0000 2010,@irfworks Hi Irfahn. Rooting a device does void the warranty.
18612090465,Thu Jul 15 15:52:34 +0000 2010,@footose I noticed that :-) The travel pack would be your best option for temp use of data in the US.
18612008958,Thu Jul 15 15:51:25 +0000 2010,@KowZ Hi Kyle, is there something I can help you with?
18611789038,Thu Jul 15 15:48:19 +0000 2010,@cellguru Not Friday either. What's going on?
18610566050,Thu Jul 15 15:31:13 +0000 2010,@SuperJens Sorry, how are the two related? OS updates are up to the device manufacturer to release before we can make it available. Thx Jens
18610455999,Thu Jul 15 15:29:44 +0000 2010,@pixeladdikt @MatthewPatience @IWMOPS I think I need an android app to keep up with you all ;-P
18610199721,Thu Jul 15 15:26:06 +0000 2010,@Andrew_GBtown Hi Andrew. Sorry but we don't discuss devices before the may/may not launch.
18602617329,Thu Jul 15 13:39:09 +0000 2010,@footose Hi Harry, this is Mary. It really depends on how much data you plan to use. You can estimate at http://www.rogers.com/calculator
18602041966,Thu Jul 15 13:30:39 +0000 2010,@NeoStylez LOL. Or, I can ask around the office today and get back to you as soon as I can. Sound like a plan?
18601904666,Thu Jul 15 13:28:38 +0000 2010,@so77 Good morning. Have you called Technical Support? They should be able to better help you trouble shoot this.
18601741824,Thu Jul 15 13:26:10 +0000 2010,@independis Hi Ralf. Not much we can do here, it is not our policy to unlock devices.
18548678941,Wed Jul 14 21:09:45 +0000 2010,@cellguru Since I don't know which meeting that is, I'll say probably not :)
18547117407,Wed Jul 14 20:41:30 +0000 2010,@cellguru You're quick!
18546534983,Wed Jul 14 20:31:08 +0000 2010,@cellguru Hey Corey. FYI, I replied to your post about the Pride parade. Hope you're doing well :-)
18542818946,Wed Jul 14 19:25:18 +0000 2010,@NeoStylez I think so but Care can confirm that for you.
18542299751,Wed Jul 14 19:16:11 +0000 2010,@StephenRLee All calls are LD? And someone in Care wasn't able to help you with that?
18465864249,Tue Jul 13 21:00:20 +0000 2010,@silvertoe LOL, I think it was a matter of timing. I'm glad it's all sorted out :-) Take care!
18465801196,Tue Jul 13 20:59:16 +0000 2010,@BradAndPercy Thanks for the info. If you have a question about that, you should direct that to Sony Ericsson.
18446850913,Tue Jul 13 15:51:02 +0000 2010,@silvertoe @IWMOPS Yes, they're allowed. Just can't be sure how they'll work on the network because they weren't tested.
18446759045,Tue Jul 13 15:49:45 +0000 2010,@queerasmoi Hi Charles. FYI, the site has been temporarily disabled. Thanks!
18440193916,Tue Jul 13 14:18:19 +0000 2010,@StephenRLee Who told you no?
18440162504,Tue Jul 13 14:17:53 +0000 2010,@Tax_On_Time I don't know the answer to that and I can't see your acct details to know for sure. Did you ask for a reason?
18439836391,Tue Jul 13 14:13:22 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Cool :-D
18439817544,Tue Jul 13 14:13:06 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS What do you mean by policy? A customer should call Tech Support and they want to check if the device can work on the network.
18439692448,Tue Jul 13 14:11:21 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS No, I don't have any details on that.
18439648115,Tue Jul 13 14:10:45 +0000 2010,@queerasmoi Looking into it. Thanks.
18377736118,Mon Jul 12 19:45:48 +0000 2010,@Tax_On_Time I'm not really very technical. Did you talk to someone in Technical Support to help you troubleshoot the issue?
18377671487,Mon Jul 12 19:44:39 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Didn't Dan leave you a voice mail last week? I'll follow up....
18375308954,Mon Jul 12 19:01:24 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS Hi Michael. That's not a question I know the answer to. Best to ask HTC as the manufacturer of the device.
18375081283,Mon Jul 12 18:57:31 +0000 2010,@pj228 That's a good question but I won't have an answer until it's released. Can you check back with me end of August?
18374893175,Mon Jul 12 18:54:06 +0000 2010,@sagaragrawal333 Hi Sagar, I can't answer on their behalf..... you'd have to ask them.
18374412555,Mon Jul 12 18:45:19 +0000 2010,@fishsauce Thanks for the info.... we passed it along to our internal team.
18143084052,Fri Jul 09 19:44:54 +0000 2010,@Oathbreaker Hi Tim, this is Mary w/ Rogers online comms team. Quick question, was that a live person or recording? I'll look into it.
18130528657,Fri Jul 09 16:24:54 +0000 2010,@agileanimal Have you tried Best Buy or Apple?
18055521393,Thu Jul 08 18:51:18 +0000 2010,@chadzinger No problem. Feel free to check in with me at the end of August for an update, if you like.
18055493781,Thu Jul 08 18:50:48 +0000 2010,@silvertoe Got it! I forwarded your case to my contact. They'll be in touch. Keep me posted.
18055243744,Thu Jul 08 18:46:21 +0000 2010,@scottdellinger Sooooo glad to hear that! Thanks for letting me know. Are you enjoying the device?
18055106737,Thu Jul 08 18:43:57 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 So funny, I was just talking about that.... and you are the first :) So, no I don't have an answer but I'll look for one.
18054859944,Thu Jul 08 18:39:36 +0000 2010,@BradAndPercy I'm not sure what the release number is.... best to let SE answer that one.
18054797239,Thu Jul 08 18:38:29 +0000 2010,@Crimsonium Hi Frank. That's a maintenance release.... I'm hearing great things about it!
18054760100,Thu Jul 08 18:37:51 +0000 2010,@TomMcGarry Hi Tom. Should be available to customers by end of August.
18054719145,Thu Jul 08 18:37:08 +0000 2010,@ryanmmoore We can only test once the manufacturer provides us with the OS. it's dependent on their release schedule.
18053309554,Thu Jul 08 18:12:49 +0000 2010,RT @RogersHelps: Hi Everyone. We have a new member on our @RogersHelps and @RogersVousAide team!!! Please welcome @RogersElise :-)
18052848479,Thu Jul 08 18:05:06 +0000 2010,@chadzinger Hey Chad... that should be coming by end of August.
18052817811,Thu Jul 08 18:04:36 +0000 2010,@lawchristopher It's a maintenance release.
18052772273,Thu Jul 08 18:03:51 +0000 2010,@alexcruise Hi Alex. So yes, I confirmed that it will be a couple of weeks before they're in store.
17982420249,Wed Jul 07 21:23:08 +0000 2010,RT @SonyEricssonCA  The X10 software upgrade has arrived in Canada! Get all your update information here: http://bit.ly/d9dCS3
17974162957,Wed Jul 07 19:35:31 +0000 2010,@mullwell Hi Dave, you'll need to discuss that with Customer Care.
17974138690,Wed Jul 07 19:35:09 +0000 2010,@silvertoe If you don't hear back by end of day, let me know and I'll escalate the issue. Did you do the upgrade or sign the waiver?
17974056276,Wed Jul 07 19:33:54 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech That's why we offered the Magic upgrade.
17974010409,Wed Jul 07 19:33:10 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech No, unfortunately that was the last update.
17965058077,Wed Jul 07 17:20:48 +0000 2010,@guelphmike Hi Mike. SE will provide Rogers with X10 OS 2.1 for testing by the Fall. Rogers will release ASAP to customers.
17964903409,Wed Jul 07 17:18:29 +0000 2010,@iagox86 I wouldn't know that. You'll have to ask them about it. Let me know how it goes, okay?
17964816660,Wed Jul 07 17:17:12 +0000 2010,@bunhead You would need to discuss that with Customer Care.
17964693863,Wed Jul 07 17:15:24 +0000 2010,@WoodlawnTech Hi Blair. HTC indicated that Dream would not have an update beyond 1.5: http://cot.ag/4Srnbz
17964260679,Wed Jul 07 17:09:05 +0000 2010,@ryanmmoore Hi Ryan. We will make it available as soon as we can.
17963914632,Wed Jul 07 17:04:02 +0000 2010,@jgirms I understand your frustration Josh, we can only test once we receive the OS from HTC.
17963734110,Wed Jul 07 17:01:27 +0000 2010,@souiuwakede_al This is specific to Rogers in Canada.
17963274664,Wed Jul 07 16:54:54 +0000 2010,@silvertoe I'm not sure what you mean by that. Can you clarify?
17963141026,Wed Jul 07 16:52:58 +0000 2010,@gusto5 Yes! Spica should have 2.1 by end of August.
17963093232,Wed Jul 07 16:52:17 +0000 2010,@iagox86 Hi Ron. I don't have access to your acct details so I can't comment but have you talked to Care about your HUP eligibility?
17963036920,Wed Jul 07 16:51:29 +0000 2010,@cocopuffz :-)
17963019950,Wed Jul 07 16:51:14 +0000 2010,@IAmTweetless Hi James. I don't have any details on 2.2 at this point.
17889559849,Tue Jul 06 19:13:35 +0000 2010,@Tax_On_Time I do understand your point and it's feedback that is shared with our internal team.
17889515705,Tue Jul 06 19:13:00 +0000 2010,@Tax_On_Time We can't test until it's made available to us by the manufacturer. That's probably a question for them.
17889055897,Tue Jul 06 19:06:53 +0000 2010,@nloko Good question but I can't answer on their behalf. Best to ask them directly.
17889030458,Tue Jul 06 19:06:26 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 Well, we're always looking to bring the latest and greatest to market :-) Thanks for not making me say say "may/may not" :P
17888928088,Tue Jul 06 19:04:42 +0000 2010,@iagox86 Unfortunately, no. HTC indicated they would not update Dream past 1.6.
17888865470,Tue Jul 06 19:03:38 +0000 2010,@silentsim That should work then. Best to discuss with Care since they have access to your account files and can confirm your plan.
17888790219,Tue Jul 06 19:02:25 +0000 2010,@strevellick Hi Shawn. It's hard to enjoy the heat when I'm stuck in a cold building :( Did you see the update I posted? Hope you're well!
17886894348,Tue Jul 06 18:32:42 +0000 2010,@Tax_On_Time I just sent out a tweet on the very subject of 2.1 :) We were expecting it for testing at end of June, just to clarify.
17886808687,Tue Jul 06 18:31:19 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 Ah Don, you ask Qs that at technically beyond me ;-) What I do know, is we anticipate the process to be done by end of Aug.
17886468240,Tue Jul 06 18:26:02 +0000 2010,@IWMOPS @scottlg10 Sorry about the confusion. I must have neglected to tell her it was due by end of June. My apologies.
17886355141,Tue Jul 06 18:24:13 +0000 2010,We’re in process of testing. No solid release date as that depends on Google's approval as well. We anticipate end of Aug but plz stay tuned
17886293177,Tue Jul 06 18:23:11 +0000 2010,Okay Magic fans, I have an update for you! Rogers has received a draft OS 2.1 Magic upgrade from HTC.
17867043357,Tue Jul 06 13:26:41 +0000 2010,@silentsim Hi. You will be able to purchase a mircosim from Rogers but we do not have activation details available yet.

17806627414,Mon Jul 05 17:47:39 +0000 2010,@CorySilver I knew that :-)
17806454569,Mon Jul 05 17:44:41 +0000 2010,@TorontoWireless Voice and text only. Info on price plans will be available when chatr launches later this summer. @CorySilver
17805661631,Mon Jul 05 17:31:02 +0000 2010,@CorySilver @TorontoWireless LOL. I was wondering that since I didn't see a question from you! Thought, better to let you know anyway :-)
17804821658,Mon Jul 05 17:17:09 +0000 2010,@TorontoWireless @CorySilver Hi Ray/Cory. FYI, the chatr_wireless acct is not a branded acct. chatr profile will release later this summer.

17755121585,Mon Jul 05 00:59:38 +0000 2010,@GregGoralski I hear ya. I personally love using My Rogers. Has the issue resolved itself?
17743453926,Sun Jul 04 20:48:35 +0000 2010,@GregGoralski Hi Greg, I just tried and it worked for me. If you call Care, they can help you with that bill.
17743362648,Sun Jul 04 20:46:27 +0000 2010,@KyeGrace For example, if any special offers were added. But, once you talk to Care let me know what they tell you.
17743326871,Sun Jul 04 20:45:38 +0000 2010,@KyeGrace Yup, that's what I meant. I can't see what's normal in this situation b/c I don't have access to your acct. details.
17741448302,Sun Jul 04 20:01:24 +0000 2010,@KyeGrace :) I don't have your acct info so I can't tell your situation but it's policy to call Care b4 I can help (if needed). Let me know!
17740960464,Sun Jul 04 19:50:01 +0000 2010,@KyeGrace Hi Kye. Did you call back into Care to clarify? What did they say?
17720221743,Sun Jul 04 13:29:21 +0000 2010,@XBrav That's really strange. Is it still doing the same thing today?

17598801874,Fri Jul 02 20:44:52 +0000 2010,@alexcruise Hmmm. Hard to tell on that one.

17593592500,Fri Jul 02 19:12:10 +0000 2010,@georgewenzel I don't think you can mix plans like that. But, if you call customer care, they can help figure out the best plan for you.

17587595053,Fri Jul 02 17:34:18 +0000 2010,@mcwetboy I'm looking into it on my end as well.
17583818638,Fri Jul 02 15:56:05 +0000 2010,@georgewenzel If you own the phone, then yes. You can sign up to any plan on a month-to-month basis. Sorry, I misunderstood your original Q.
17580246724,Fri Jul 02 15:20:03 +0000 2010,@ChiefBroom Have you talked to Technical Support about this?
17580111938,Fri Jul 02 15:18:19 +0000 2010,@razorgoto Do you mean between family members or devices?
17580032470,Fri Jul 02 15:17:16 +0000 2010,@mcwetboy Hi Jonathan, this is Mary w/Rogers online comms team. Have you called Care about this? If so, what did they advise?

15712877495,Tue Jun 08 15:13:08 +0000 2010,@dodo_dragos Hi there. Sorry, I'm not clear on the question. For what purpose would this be?
15673617892,Tue Jun 08 02:06:20 +0000 2010,@naschmid It should be 1.6. Anytime Nicholas, if I have the answer I'm happy to share :)
15673513220,Tue Jun 08 02:04:49 +0000 2010,@jasonvermes Go to www.rogers.com and sign up for My Rogers if you haven't already. I find it very convenient.

15673413305,Tue Jun 08 02:03:22 +0000 2010,@justinpoirier5 Was there not an "upgrade my phone" option? I can check which devices are available to me on my next upgrade.

12642537884,Thu Apr 22 14:39:55 +0000 2010,@DGfromMTL Should be Talk-time.... best to call Care as they'll have all usage on file and can help you out.

10738140506,Fri Mar 19 19:45:15 +0000 2010,@bsarich Thanks Brennan :-) Which session were you in?
10738083598,Fri Mar 19 19:43:46 +0000 2010,@philmoreira What device do you use?

10738016502,Fri Mar 19 19:41:59 +0000 2010,@astroboy Hi Robb! Sorry I didn't get back to you. We actually had the opportunity to meet with Howard directly so discussed with him.
10736324318,Fri Mar 19 18:57:23 +0000 2010,@tattsjane Thanks for the tweet Jane. FYI we try to resolve cust service issues much faster. Let me know if you need anything in future.
10735683368,Fri Mar 19 18:40:44 +0000 2010,@jaimewoo Great session last night Jamie :-) I'll never reveal my sources, especially when dessert is involved!
10735624084,Fri Mar 19 18:39:17 +0000 2010,@kirota01 Hi Nicole. I don't have access to your account details so I can't answer that. Best to discuss with Customer Care.
10735592526,Fri Mar 19 18:38:28 +0000 2010,@ChiefBroom Unfortunately, I can't comment on future promotions.
10735569406,Fri Mar 19 18:37:53 +0000 2010,@LarysaW Hey Larysa, great to finally meet you. Thanks for the note! I'll have to agree with you ;-) It helps to work w/ such a great team.
10735512383,Fri Mar 19 18:36:26 +0000 2010,@philmoreira Hi Phil. What are your data needs like? A chat with Live Support could help determine if there is an option to suit your needs.
10735385157,Fri Mar 19 18:33:14 +0000 2010,@jessbennett LOL. It's my favorite ring tone :P
10730485947,Fri Mar 19 16:35:00 +0000 2010,@DaveColeman I realize that doesn't help you today but wanted to let you know we're listening to your feedback & working to make it better.
10730448439,Fri Mar 19 16:34:11 +0000 2010,@DaveColeman Still, we are working with our roaming partners across the world to reduce our rates to pass saving along to the customer.
10730417682,Fri Mar 19 16:33:30 +0000 2010,@DaveColeman Hey Dave. The travel packs released in summer '09 significantly reduced int'l roaming rates making us extremely competitive.
10727520399,Fri Mar 19 15:28:46 +0000 2010,@DaveColeman Hi Dave, this is Mary w/Rogers. Can you clarify the issue plz. Sounds like your looking for extra data while on a trip? Right?
10727128018,Fri Mar 19 15:20:09 +0000 2010,@kotoryushan Hi Chris. Yup, they have an OS path! Magic+ -&gt; 2.1, X10 -&gt; 2.x, Spica -&gt; 2.1 and Acer Liquid debuts with 2.1.
10724897082,Fri Mar 19 14:31:52 +0000 2010,@Jedstah Okay, since it's with a rep already let me know when they return your call. I'll take it from there if there are continued issues.
10724838534,Fri Mar 19 14:30:37 +0000 2010,@ChiefBroom It was not online but a special promotion to customers who wanted an upgrade due to the OS.
10689883515,Thu Mar 18 21:19:42 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 Sorry Don, I'm still looking in to that. Apologize for the delay.
10679784415,Thu Mar 18 16:55:04 +0000 2010,@fuzzz Great, thanks! I'll pass that on.
10677902814,Thu Mar 18 16:10:30 +0000 2010,@tattsjane Hi Jane, this is Mary. Thanks for the tweet and suggestion! (Would that be a tweetgestion?) I'll pass it on to the team.
10677798746,Thu Mar 18 16:08:05 +0000 2010,@vancouverkate Hi Kate, I work w/Miranda. Not a dumb question. I had to look it up myself! As long as data is turned off, it should be fine.
10677358901,Thu Mar 18 15:58:07 +0000 2010,@fuzzz The next time it happens, can you please right down your exact location? I'll ensure the team is notified so they can investigate.
10677277398,Thu Mar 18 15:56:13 +0000 2010,@Jedstah What did they say?
10677253990,Thu Mar 18 15:55:40 +0000 2010,@KnightLova @Tabbicats Thanks for letting me know. Can you monitor over the next few days and let me know if it continues?
10676968826,Thu Mar 18 15:49:05 +0000 2010,@sweetescapes I can't see your acct details so I don't know what's being done. But, if you need me to assist please let me know.
10669484363,Thu Mar 18 12:53:02 +0000 2010,@sweetescapes Hi there, saw your tweet. Can I help?

10634325540,Wed Mar 17 19:07:17 +0000 2010,@fuzzz Hey Andre. Do you have a specific location you could send me? It would help to investigate.
10634221691,Wed Mar 17 19:04:27 +0000 2010,@puleen @GreatBigDog01 @IWMOPS Believe it or not, that article was before my time ;-) Let me see what I can find out about that.
10633814833,Wed Mar 17 18:53:05 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 Hi Don. As you know, I can't comment on devices before they may or may not be launched. Thanks for asking :)
10633390695,Wed Mar 17 18:40:55 +0000 2010,@rescuenil I replied back. I need your full name, please.

10620879494,Wed Mar 17 13:18:46 +0000 2010,@cdstew @nexusoneit Google is selling the Nexus One directly so there are no subsidies available from Rogers. Thanks!

10598177072,Wed Mar 17 01:28:06 +0000 2010,@jmakarow Hi Jason. Did you get my email? I replied to yours yesterday.
10585115862,Tue Mar 16 20:02:10 +0000 2010,@jmakarow Jason, Mary's off today. Google is selling the Nexus One directly so there are no subsidies available from Rogers.
10546164069,Tue Mar 16 01:35:15 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 We'd be thrilled with paid apps in Canada. Both have been eagerly anticipated :)
10544168009,Tue Mar 16 00:51:34 +0000 2010,@rylake Hi. Just wanted to let you know that the Android app is out. Search “Rogers My Account” in Android Market :)

10529292171,Mon Mar 15 18:30:52 +0000 2010,@stefanz OK. Let me know if you need anything :)
10529275073,Mon Mar 15 18:30:27 +0000 2010,@alexflint @nscafe Totally normal to see all available networks in automatic mode :-)
10526829931,Mon Mar 15 17:25:47 +0000 2010,@85alex Hi Alex, not yet. Current promo is extended to May 3 and we'll likely use @RogersBuzz when we have news to share.
10520427881,Mon Mar 15 14:47:35 +0000 2010,@stefanz Hi Stefan, I work w/Keith who's out of office. That is strange. Thanks for letting us know. Is there anything you need help with?
10516672298,Mon Mar 15 13:12:50 +0000 2010,@elbachir I've passed your fb to the team but the one rate plan does not specifically target one plan. An add-on plan is your best option.
10437718370,Sat Mar 13 20:47:13 +0000 2010,@Techgoji Thanks Will.
10437623661,Sat Mar 13 20:44:22 +0000 2010,@afreak You get the 100 minutes when you complete the upgrade.
10429802293,Sat Mar 13 17:05:43 +0000 2010,@canyewtell We are bringing the rate in line with those charged by other Canadian wireless service providers.
10429747341,Sat Mar 13 17:04:21 +0000 2010,@captainnapalm Hi Brendan. We announced it would be available in Q2, I can't be more specific than that at this time.
10424491016,Sat Mar 13 14:50:38 +0000 2010,@SM_YVR I'll pass along the suggestion. Thanks.
10402293794,Sat Mar 13 02:22:41 +0000 2010,@rescuenil I'm still not clear on what the specific issue is. Do you want to send me an email to explain? I can DM our address.
10402240821,Sat Mar 13 02:21:20 +0000 2010,@karinatwork Hi Karin. Thx for asking but we can't discuss speculation. When we have announcements we'll edo so through @RogersBuzz.
10401847868,Sat Mar 13 02:11:29 +0000 2010,@5fifty5 Really? Okay, let me go back to my colleague and see what advice he had. It may be Monday before I hear back from him.
10401780056,Sat Mar 13 02:09:48 +0000 2010,@XBrav That would be cool! I'll have to look into the other on Monday. I haven't heard that one before. I'll get back to you.
10401726624,Sat Mar 13 02:08:24 +0000 2010,@SM_YVR I've never heard that issue. I'd need the csr's name so we could investigate. As for the other Q, you'll need to talk to Care.
10399965868,Sat Mar 13 01:24:13 +0000 2010,@slicktor Do you have an email account we could use? Perhaps Office of the President can talk with you via email. Plz DM your email.
10395511866,Fri Mar 12 23:31:19 +0000 2010,@fzlhmt Great! That's good for me to know. Thanks Ali.

10393745277,Fri Mar 12 22:45:59 +0000 2010,@SM_YVR Sorry, I wasn't aware. Is there something specific I can help you with?

10391464704,Fri Mar 12 21:46:04 +0000 2010,@SM_YVR Hi. Not sure I know what you mean. Have you changes accounts? I can't see our conversation history.
10391419634,Fri Mar 12 21:44:53 +0000 2010,@rescuenil Can you clarify? We don't carry the G1
10391388267,Fri Mar 12 21:44:03 +0000 2010,@dblacombe The HTC Dream has a qwerty keyboard: http://cot.ag/bEav1D
10386739076,Fri Mar 12 19:39:59 +0000 2010,@dblacombe ....and although we'd LOVE paid apps in Canada, they are not yet available. That's up to Google to enable. Hope I got it all :)
10386700462,Fri Mar 12 19:38:55 +0000 2010,@dblacombe We also announced Sony Ericsson X10 & Acer Liquid. OS upgrades r released by the manufacturer. All but Dream have a path to 2.x.

10386399419,Fri Mar 12 19:30:50 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 I'll take that one to Reade and team :)

10336092709,Thu Mar 11 19:26:55 +0000 2010,@slicktor Who have you been in touch with? If you have a computer, Live Support should be able to help. Or dial *611 free from your mobile.
10334682925,Thu Mar 11 18:47:48 +0000 2010,@TheChefUpstairs Social media is one of the ways we're helping customers. Let me know if you have any questions :)

10322611734,Thu Mar 11 13:48:36 +0000 2010,@awryter Hi Daniel. I should be getting a Galaxy Spica today so I'll add your name to the review list.
10321717823,Thu Mar 11 13:24:36 +0000 2010,@monicarooney Okay. If you need us, feel free to reach out to @RogersHelps. Take care :)
10321651596,Thu Mar 11 13:22:45 +0000 2010,@JasonDeline Good question. I don't have my PVR handy at the moment but I'll try it out. I'll also ask around, today. I'll get back to you!

10285229563,Wed Mar 10 19:30:28 +0000 2010,@JasonDeline Does that answer your question on procedure?
10285214010,Wed Mar 10 19:30:07 +0000 2010,@JasonDeline Hi Jason. I do this all the time :) When you set end-time, move over to the minutes & increase. I find 3mins is usually enough.
10281849163,Wed Mar 10 17:59:25 +0000 2010,@5fifty5 Thank you! The team will love hearing that :)
10281701257,Wed Mar 10 17:55:20 +0000 2010,@puleen I was letting him know as soon I had information. I'll circle back with my team.

9881549061,Tue Mar 02 16:41:06 +0000 2010,@chriswtburke Appreciate the f/b, I'll pass it on. Just fyi we have very favorable rates and there is a $10/mnth option as well.
9881395616,Tue Mar 02 16:37:05 +0000 2010,@canyewtell Not same. One rate is intended for frequent travels who need competitive roaming rates for significant data use when traveling.
9879872374,Tue Mar 02 15:58:12 +0000 2010,@XBrav The update has provided the the capability to do that.

9854062027,Tue Mar 02 02:13:41 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 .....and, I can't discuss devices before the may/may not launch. Not an auto-response, just is the policy :)
9853973780,Tue Mar 02 02:11:35 +0000 2010,@GreatBigDog01 It's not about cost but the uncertainty of how the device will function on our network. But, I'll pass along your suggestion.
