812270273789575200,Fri Dec 23 12:14:59 +0000 2016,@randymartin7347 Even if Zakk Wylde does a reunion w/ them, won't be the same.

812269682686390300,Fri Dec 23 12:12:38 +0000 2016,@randymartin7347 I suggest taking a reading comprehension class. But thanks for reminding me that I don't suck.

811949869959024600,Thu Dec 22 15:01:48 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie I'd be very curious 2get yr take (from a tech perspective) on the trend twards generic design. Discuss w/ me+@jamesbrowntv?
811949349588582400,Thu Dec 22 14:59:44 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv Yeah, that's what I mean. They had a nice/unique "look" and now they look like glorified Wordpress!
811949187143188500,Thu Dec 22 14:59:06 +0000 2016,@jamesbrowntv If @ShortFormErnie is game, I'm totally up for it.
811949064585678800,Thu Dec 22 14:58:36 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv And you're saying @MSNBC took a step backwards from a sheer design/eye-pleasing pov?
811948804895309800,Thu Dec 22 14:57:35 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv I'll check it out. But I'd be curious to get your take on some recent re-designs, ESPN and others.
811948299133616100,Thu Dec 22 14:55:34 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv I'll check it out. (You mean "new site design"? And are you familiar w/ what I'm talkin 'bout? Check @ESPN.)
811947803111018500,Thu Dec 22 14:53:36 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie If @jamesbrowntv argues that that doesn't matter in favor of bottom line I strongly disagree. Both shld be considered.
811947645514240000,Thu Dec 22 14:52:58 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv The sites I'm thinking of had really nice graphic design. They look generic af now.
811947458695753700,Thu Dec 22 14:52:14 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv Even if the tech side is covered, I don't think the asthetic side just doesn't matter.
811947131741343700,Thu Dec 22 14:50:56 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv Also, some hugely popular sites have in recent yrs gone to generic Wordpress-like templates. Step bckwrds imo.
811936347976007700,Thu Dec 22 14:08:05 +0000 2016,Got to expound at length on @Pantera's Great Southern Trendkill reissue for @pitchfork will discuss soon on @2Booked https://t.co/UINJtlXsHM

811600461207900200,Wed Dec 21 15:53:23 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked (Carefully executed w/out neglecting the value of effective graphic design -- for phones especially.)
811600267640787000,Wed Dec 21 15:52:37 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked Nice! And I'm not saying re-designs are bad across the board, but they need 2b carefully executed.
811600056319176700,Wed Dec 21 15:51:46 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked And solving one doesn't always one:for:one equate. With graphics, bad choices can be made.
811599856020099100,Wed Dec 21 15:50:59 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked My main point is that the tech aspect can be advanced while the graphics aspect takes a step back.
811599518936469500,Wed Dec 21 15:49:38 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked Cool, looks enlightening. I'll check it out.
811599418726219800,Wed Dec 21 15:49:14 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked But there's a reason golden arches have had basically 1 redesign in like 60-plus years.
811599327076515800,Wed Dec 21 15:48:53 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked I would agree with that -- or at least never stop exploring.
811599190686048300,Wed Dec 21 15:48:20 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked My point is that you don't throw the graphics out the window for tech and re-designs can be mistakes.
811598874196537300,Wed Dec 21 15:47:05 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked Fair point, but it isn't always executed well. And the fact that Slate is going slow speaks to that.
811598667014619100,Wed Dec 21 15:46:15 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked Also we can't assume that re-design nec'ly equates w/ tech optimization even when that's intention.
811598193666486300,Wed Dec 21 15:44:22 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked I like the way Slate is doing it -- kinda beta testing in "one small corner of the site"
811597788672852000,Wed Dec 21 15:42:46 +0000 2016,@jamesbrowntv @ShortFormErnie @2Booked So what is the value of a successful graphic design as a component of brand -- nothing?
811597541129207800,Wed Dec 21 15:41:47 +0000 2016,@ShortFormErnie @jamesbrowntv @2Booked Sticking with a successful graphic design isn't the same as Craigs #SlipperySlopeArgument
