836396948752052200,Tue Feb 28 02:05:46 +0000 2017,Hi Alicia @stales I didn't think I'd be at #BCSM as a patient. After 4 years, dx came as late stage, aggressive, metastasized.
836389857127706600,Tue Feb 28 01:37:35 +0000 2017,My costs were from late detection despite doctor visits from new standards. 4 years to diagnose=no ADLs before Dx #BCSM @CultPerfectMoms
836389472703037400,Tue Feb 28 01:36:04 +0000 2017,Cancer has cost me a half million dollar home, my business and all I had. I don't know cost of chemo in particular. #BCSM @CultPerfectMoms

836051071789383700,Mon Feb 27 03:11:23 +0000 2017,@MaryAnneMolter Screening guidelines lost me at least four years of my life from symptoms to dx because of age. #BCSM
836047225646112800,Mon Feb 27 02:56:06 +0000 2017,I'd be really open to hearing anyone who went through A/C. They say unlike the other chemos, it's not for the weak of heart @MaryBethC @BCSM
836046882354905100,Mon Feb 27 02:54:44 +0000 2017,TY @MaryBethC I should have come on earlier. It's late stage, but I am DETERMINED that I'll beat this monster. #BCSM
836044090361905200,Mon Feb 27 02:43:38 +0000 2017,I'm so so sorry @wjmarchitect I haven't gotten our fab first interviews up. Just after, I got a dx of cancer. I'm just now getting online.
836042297448009700,Mon Feb 27 02:36:31 +0000 2017,Ah, of course I announced my cancer during the oscars. So much for timing...

836040753524650000,Mon Feb 27 02:30:23 +0000 2017,I know it's been forever. I'm in 2nd round chemo (A/C) for aggressive metastized ductal carcinoma- yeah, that's cancer. #BCSM
