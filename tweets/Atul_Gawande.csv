719501402561724400,Mon Apr 11 12:24:36 +0000 2016,9. Unstudied: how education/cognition affects lifespan, w better behavior, planning, ability to navigate health sys https://t.co/payaTG6GKM
719500199966744600,Mon Apr 11 12:19:49 +0000 2016,8. Local factors that do matter were: amt of local govt spending, pop density, % of college grads, % of immigrants. All GOOD for lifespan.
719499752673525800,Mon Apr 11 12:18:03 +0000 2016,7. BUT: the report did not find a significant contribution to lifespan differences from car crashes, suicide, or homicide.
719498239754510300,Mon Apr 11 12:12:02 +0000 2016,6. Life expectancy among low income was strongly affected by health behaviors, esp smoking, obesity, and (positively) exercise.
719497648496123900,Mon Apr 11 12:09:41 +0000 2016,5. Also surprisingly: greater residential segregation by income did not correlate w lower lifespan --if anything, life span was higher (?!)
719496563740045300,Mon Apr 11 12:05:23 +0000 2016,4. Level of income inequality, religiosity, or racial concentration were NOT independently associated w lifespan (surprisingly).
719496234994679800,Mon Apr 11 12:04:04 +0000 2016,3. Higher overall Medicare spending does not correlate with longer life. But higher preventive care spending DOES.
719495908824596500,Mon Apr 11 12:02:46 +0000 2016,3. Where you live matters a lot -- if you are low income. You have the lowest life expectancy in: NV, IN, OK. Highest in: CA, NY, VT.
