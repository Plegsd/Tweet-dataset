254407663981584400,Sat Oct 06 02:28:08 +0000 2012,Running outdoors in Bombay is an obstacle race - cars, cycles, dogs, dog shit, pot holes, puddles, garbage and of course ppl. But fresh air!
254407029911863300,Sat Oct 06 02:25:37 +0000 2012,I know I make my runs sound like school homework. Its only so that I can keep myself motivated. Putting it out there in the universe helps:)

231601339837325300,Sat Aug 04 04:03:57 +0000 2012,@satyadeepmisra exactly why I thought of it. I take out my aggression in running, because its hard. :) soon I hope for serenity.

231281067359879170,Fri Aug 03 06:51:18 +0000 2012,@tweetjha that's why i said when u truly love yourself. If u love yourself too much to cause aggression, its not actual love, its arrogance.

231271404245491700,Fri Aug 03 06:12:54 +0000 2012,Just a thought while running - aggression comes from self hate. If you truly love yourself, u wouldn't be aggressive with others. Hozzat?

209475426479915000,Mon Jun 04 02:43:28 +0000 2012,Juhu beach aftr a sunday is just littered with plastic bags. So sad. Enjoy nature &amp; trample all over it. A walk 2 the bin is hardly exercise

207667852671598600,Wed May 30 03:00:49 +0000 2012,But will remain positive. Feeling fresh. Will finish all the household chores. That's exercise in itself (to some extent) :)

207049063156285440,Mon May 28 10:01:58 +0000 2012,@aradhikamehta that's true of most things, but it genuinely was interesting. Had radio plays, informative talk show, music of diff genres.
207027497760587780,Mon May 28 08:36:16 +0000 2012,Radio used 2 be so entertaining earlier. I remember listening to a lot in my 10th boards prep. Now I spend time more time changing channels!

207003993749196800,Mon May 28 07:02:52 +0000 2012,@iam_prash i'm happy to have those kind of pointless conversations with close friends.. :)
207003317107310600,Mon May 28 07:00:11 +0000 2012,@iam_prash not people perhaps.. but conversations and interactions feel very pointless.. I feel i could do a lot better with my time instead

21916988652,Mon Aug 23 14:12:55 +0000 2010,Sometimes opening up your mind and letting some fresh stimulus and air in is good enough!
21916982081,Mon Aug 23 14:12:50 +0000 2010,had a fabulous 'productive' day. No regrets for not having really 'done' anything.
21916901478,Mon Aug 23 14:11:43 +0000 2010,@DoP_Bose i think it still would.. it happens to all my other non filmy friends and family members too.. :)
21893621870,Mon Aug 23 06:54:49 +0000 2010,@DoP_Bose it happens even without that. We are all busy with our own lives no(whatever it is we do or not do)? :)
21893569148,Mon Aug 23 06:53:36 +0000 2010,But then maybe Im lucky to have a bunch of friends with whom endless conversation entails everything under the sun 'n not 'people talk' only
21893488990,Mon Aug 23 06:51:43 +0000 2010,People always talk of 'whiling away time' when you spend a day just chatting with friends. I think its productive. It makes you grow.
21893198650,Mon Aug 23 06:45:02 +0000 2010,..but we realise that only when we meet them next. They reflect an aspect of you, you might have almost forgotten.
21893186779,Mon Aug 23 06:44:46 +0000 2010,A friend of mine said something beautiful about friendship- its an investment we make of unknown little details and things (continued)..
21892955471,Mon Aug 23 06:39:33 +0000 2010,Today's a day of meeting close friends I haven't met or won't meet for a while. Can't have them think I don't care, as its so so untrue!
21892827330,Mon Aug 23 06:36:36 +0000 2010,Not been sleeping very well. Almost turning insomniac. One good thing came out of it. I started reading murakami's after dark. I'm hooked!!

19555770414,Mon Jul 26 07:26:33 +0000 2010,@sidharthamallya hey.. what happened to you??
19324312987,Fri Jul 23 08:43:06 +0000 2010,i've experienced a wide range of things in my life but i've only just started living..
19321723526,Fri Jul 23 07:42:49 +0000 2010,@Naman_Mukerji22 nice try.. But no not at all ! :)
19321646082,Fri Jul 23 07:41:03 +0000 2010,learn to love yourself and engage with yourself because no one will give you as much time as u can give yourself!
19321329076,Fri Jul 23 07:33:45 +0000 2010,2 days to go before i leave to join Ra 1 ! Very excited.. :)
19242261975,Thu Jul 22 09:33:00 +0000 2010,tending to someone unwell makes you feel maternal.. And watching them improve even more so :)
19234858178,Thu Jul 22 06:38:02 +0000 2010,the physical memory of pain fades much faster than that of pleasure. At least i think so :)
19234722401,Thu Jul 22 06:35:01 +0000 2010,hello ! My disappearances are becoming more common.. :)
18897579846,Mon Jul 19 07:00:49 +0000 2010,@mriganayanika call meee! Or tell me when to call... !!
18894297070,Mon Jul 19 05:49:40 +0000 2010,@mriganayanika yay.. green bindi? i can imagine.. hmm.. nicce!
18893377132,Mon Jul 19 05:31:16 +0000 2010,@mriganayanika hahaha.. i don't know why! :)

18891782469,Mon Jul 19 05:01:17 +0000 2010,@PVRCinema :)
18891758243,Mon Jul 19 05:00:52 +0000 2010,Friday's- always been my favourite. Right positioning in the week, movie releases, pre weekend, close enough to a monday to look forward to!
18891569087,Mon Jul 19 04:57:35 +0000 2010,On the flip side, its very frustrating if you have friends with a week of work! A constant reminder of every depressing monday!
18891480935,Mon Jul 19 04:55:57 +0000 2010,The beauty of a freelance job and that too in the creative field - no concept of a weekend or monday blues for that matter!
18891413473,Mon Jul 19 04:54:44 +0000 2010,@PVRCinema Any your company wants to offer me? :)
18891309053,Mon Jul 19 04:52:50 +0000 2010,@ManishAcharya oh one of those! Lovely. Do you remember much of the weekend though? That also helps to look forward to a Monday! :)
18891039714,Mon Jul 19 04:48:01 +0000 2010,@shehzadjoey so I hear.. will go watch it soon..
18890502000,Mon Jul 19 04:38:31 +0000 2010,good morning! To a productive day of helping out a friend and catching up on all my script reading! What about u? Monday blues?
18890328067,Mon Jul 19 04:35:28 +0000 2010,@aamir_khan its pretty good. Maybe more to a north indian sensibility (the jokes, which I thoroughly enjoyed) but funny and well executed.
18860707805,Sun Jul 18 19:49:50 +0000 2010,@shahdarshak yes.. they have to have another persona online..
18850961884,Sun Jul 18 16:40:13 +0000 2010,@ashok20 They must also be fans of people.. :)
18850884649,Sun Jul 18 16:38:52 +0000 2010,when I said 'most wanted' I meant dangerous criminal sorts.. not popular celebrity variety! :) Just clarifying..
18850516466,Sun Jul 18 16:32:20 +0000 2010,You think all these 'most wanted' people are all on twitter and other social networking sites enjoying a normal interaction like all of us?
18850257185,Sun Jul 18 16:27:50 +0000 2010,Going to watch Tere Bin Laden. Heard GREAT things about it and know I will nothing but LOVE it! I wonder if Osama has heard of it..
18849013254,Sun Jul 18 16:06:27 +0000 2010,@Atharluvsrk I'm good.. big hug to you too..
18848909171,Sun Jul 18 16:04:43 +0000 2010,@Aleshanee29 to you too..
18848638437,Sun Jul 18 16:00:19 +0000 2010,@Danabolly no.. not really.. I had a fun and easy teenage life..
18848598986,Sun Jul 18 15:59:44 +0000 2010,@songwriter_123 I like any kind of poetry. If i can't understand it then I like being explained..
