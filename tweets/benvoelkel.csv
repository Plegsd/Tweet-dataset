448189260664164350,Mon Mar 24 20:07:01 +0000 2014,@dwalsh76 @JustinEPhillips point is, if smart wants to hit it really big, he can stay where he is, keep winning + be in mix for any BIG job.
448187841802432500,Mon Mar 24 20:01:23 +0000 2014,@JustinEPhillips ok, but you're saying marquette is such a better offer than who has come calling the last few years? not buying it.

448185940293713900,Mon Mar 24 19:53:49 +0000 2014,@dwalsh76 @JustinEPhillips ask crean, monson, etc. how great jumping to a supposed "bigger" job is when you have a good thing going.
448185452361969660,Mon Mar 24 19:51:53 +0000 2014,@dwalsh76 why far, far better? b/c they won a natl title 40 yrs ago? A10 at least = big east. nothing he can do at marq he can't do at vcu
448184948995129340,Mon Mar 24 19:49:53 +0000 2014,@JustinEPhillips conferences more or less equal. already has his players in place. has goodwill at a place where little expected.
448183789412687900,Mon Mar 24 19:45:16 +0000 2014,@dwalsh76 or that it's maybe a marginally better job than he has now.
