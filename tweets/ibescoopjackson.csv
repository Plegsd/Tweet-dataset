792140833826836500,Fri Oct 28 23:07:46 +0000 2016,@khogey33 which is why in the context of the piece the WSox weren't mentioned. NEVER FORGOTTEN. Hope you (all) can respect that. If not....
792140465990533100,Fri Oct 28 23:06:19 +0000 2016,@khogey33 hate to say, but when dealing with "importance" to the city, the Sox WS win, doesn't compete with the Bulls 6. the Bears 1 or BH 3

792138504033579000,Fri Oct 28 22:58:31 +0000 2016,@khogey33 not a gloss over. you (and I both) know that the other teams chips are MUCH more bigger in meaning to the city.

746824383579193300,Sat Jun 25 21:56:23 +0000 2016,@ChantreC but still, I totally agree with you. I just felt it could have been editorially "presented" better. Nor as "angry and personal."
746823937380749300,Sat Jun 25 21:54:36 +0000 2016,@ChantreC it came came off as a personal issue that should not have been presented as a universal issue.

746823566306459600,Sat Jun 25 21:53:08 +0000 2016,@ChantreC true. But once again, the "tone" of the piece still rings of something deeper than just that. As if she's mad/tired at the world
746809507154694100,Sat Jun 25 20:57:16 +0000 2016,@ChantreC just thought the article in tone was rather mean spirited and a little self centered. That's all.
