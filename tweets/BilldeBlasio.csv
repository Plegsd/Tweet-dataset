790989969670234100,Tue Oct 25 18:54:39 +0000 2016,Progressives should be encouraged by early voting reports across the country. Today, 37 states offer early voting. New York should join them
790934707101900800,Tue Oct 25 15:15:03 +0000 2016,It’s not just Donald Trump. As a general rule, the wealthy are not paying their fair share in this country. Hillary Clinton will change that

789152211808948200,Thu Oct 20 17:12:03 +0000 2016,A racist, delusional con artist with yet another pathetic excuse for his inevitable loss. Trump is going to lose. B… https://t.co/TdncUez6TQ
788940982997876700,Thu Oct 20 03:12:42 +0000 2016,Third world dictators say out loud they won't accept the results of a democratic election, not American presidential candidates.
788938099841695700,Thu Oct 20 03:01:15 +0000 2016,Great debate for Hillary Clinton. 3 for 3. Meanwhile, Trump was overtly racist and boasted about being a One-Percent tax cheater.
788932116310552600,Thu Oct 20 02:37:28 +0000 2016,Hillary has made the cause of children and families her life's work. That's the kind of President we've been waiting for!
788931376460468200,Thu Oct 20 02:34:32 +0000 2016,Hillary makes it clear: time to raise taxes on the wealthy. No ifs ands or buts. It's time!
788929057517862900,Thu Oct 20 02:25:19 +0000 2016,Bernie is right: Trump is the most dangerous candidate for President we have ever seen.
788925458192752600,Thu Oct 20 02:11:01 +0000 2016,Trump admits he didn't pay taxes and then attacks "special interests." He is the ultimate special interest, gaming the system in every way.
788924204880126000,Thu Oct 20 02:06:02 +0000 2016,"Who DOES that?” - Hillary re: Trump Foundation, but it applies to every shocking thing Donald has said and done.

788921139611439100,Thu Oct 20 01:53:51 +0000 2016,Billionaire Trump is part of the problem: shipped jobs overseas, stiffed American workers, didn't pay his taxes. A classic one-percenter.
788919087774785500,Thu Oct 20 01:45:42 +0000 2016,"We tried cutting taxes on the wealthy and it did not work.” Simple, powerful point by Hillary Clinton.

788916399884435500,Thu Oct 20 01:35:01 +0000 2016,Trump praises his role model Vladimir Putin and insults our intelligence community. He is the definition of a Russian puppet.
788915631529877500,Thu Oct 20 01:31:58 +0000 2016,Well, that's not even a dog whistle - that's OVERT racism: Trump equates "hombres" with bad people.
788913375279538200,Thu Oct 20 01:23:00 +0000 2016,Trump wants to follow the "Constitution as it was meant to be." So that means only white male landowners get to vote...?
788912559340519400,Thu Oct 20 01:19:46 +0000 2016,Righteous clarity by Hillary: "I will defend Planned Parenthood, I will defend Roe v. Wade."
788910257829449700,Thu Oct 20 01:10:37 +0000 2016,Trump's delusional nature is showing one minute into his opening. He clearly isn't reading the same polls we all are.
