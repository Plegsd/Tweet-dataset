18166038000,Sat Jul 10 02:39:52 +0000 2010,@Kumar_UD though I do have to say that the quality of VFX work is rising with each feature as local artists become more technically savvy.
18139574752,Fri Jul 09 18:43:40 +0000 2010,@m_sravan yes, though not all myself! I was head of the rendering / compositing pipeline and QC for the stadium / fort & city sequences only
18139486743,Fri Jul 09 18:42:08 +0000 2010,@Kumar_UD Both. Quality = Time = Money. Affect one, it affects the other two. Also depends on producer / director's vfx use of all three.
18136144634,Fri Jul 09 17:47:43 +0000 2010,@NielBushnell maybe they were doing a sponsored silence??
18132516047,Fri Jul 09 16:53:35 +0000 2010,@nnvsabari I do not know. I only worked on one sequence in my home studio for Endhiran which took seven months to produce and is all CGI.
18131017674,Fri Jul 09 16:31:50 +0000 2010,@nnvsabari cheers for the comments - yes working with good directors who know about the vfx process helps immensely
18130897839,Fri Jul 09 16:30:10 +0000 2010,@nnvsabari Endhiran was good - a huge amount of work to get the detail. Hopefully all of it will be in there after the edit. We will see...

17869448376,Tue Jul 06 14:05:13 +0000 2010,@vaibhavkrishna ... but I think the limited amount of 3D screens in TN didn't mean it was viable. This may be true or not... not 100% sure.
17869318849,Tue Jul 06 14:03:13 +0000 2010,@vaibhavkrishna to my knowledge (and this is limited as I worked on one 100% cg  sequence leading up to a song) they were going to...
