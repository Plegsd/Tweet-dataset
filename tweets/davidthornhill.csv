396300223682969600,Fri Nov 01 15:38:30 +0000 2013,The most obvious ... this is a team that needed more runs. And it had its chances to score them. And looked awful when given those chances.
396300020427026400,Fri Nov 01 15:37:42 +0000 2013,For all the talk about the #cardinalway, let's be honest ... this is a team with 97 wins and some obvious flaws.
396299738863374340,Fri Nov 01 15:36:35 +0000 2013,What we saw was a truly historic from Ortiz, and completely predictable from the #stlcards.
396299396855636000,Fri Nov 01 15:35:13 +0000 2013,The #stlcards hit .146 with no RBIs in spots 6-9 in the lineup. (Old school stats, yes, but I'm guessing that's a negative WAR and VORP.)
396298959809171460,Fri Nov 01 15:33:29 +0000 2013,The #stlcards couldn't pitch to him, or around him. That freight train was coming home, and often. The #birds were gonna have to score.
