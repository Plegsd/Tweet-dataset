73601198556585980,Thu May 26 04:07:47 +0000 2011,@rockrichard are you suggesting we base US procurement on assumption China will never threaten our interests or allies?
73600423465992200,Thu May 26 04:04:43 +0000 2011,@rockrichard That's just an amazingly risky assumption you're making, & one the military would be irresponsible to share and doesn't share.

73595977990283260,Thu May 26 03:47:03 +0000 2011,@rockrichard let's both agree that some extravagant procurement programs, for all their problems, are worth the cost.
73595717322674180,Thu May 26 03:46:01 +0000 2011,@rockrichard f-22 not a concept, and merits of its own. but i take some consolation in the left being forced to defend $1 trillion fighter.
73593797124169730,Thu May 26 03:38:23 +0000 2011,@rockrichard it would have given us a credible threat of killing JSF & 2 cos making planes. now JSF too big to fail and no other options.
