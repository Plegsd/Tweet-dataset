580422231223889900,Tue Mar 24 17:33:38 +0000 2015,This Pres can sit at a negotiating table with folks who say "death to America," but cannot sit at a table with the Prime Minister of Israel.
580421950134186000,Tue Mar 24 17:32:31 +0000 2015,It’s simply because President Obama doesn’t value the strategic and historic bond between the United States and Israel.

578947462909571100,Fri Mar 20 15:53:26 +0000 2015,If Sec. Clinton says nothing, as is her custom, then she affirms the President’s decision to abandon our closest ally in the Middle East.

552900661797716000,Wed Jan 07 18:52:44 +0000 2015,That these terrorists targeted members of the press shows their contempt for the freedom of expression and the values of a free society.
552900520105754600,Wed Jan 07 18:52:11 +0000 2015,The attack in Paris is another reminder of the horrific evil that terrorists are capable of. We must stop at nothing to eliminate them.

552564397194088450,Tue Jan 06 20:36:33 +0000 2015,It is a shame the president is bowing to the radical left and ignoring his own administration that has said the pipeline is safe.
552564277782253600,Tue Jan 06 20:36:04 +0000 2015,The opposition to Keystone is not based on science or reason and it's holding our country back.
552564184500936700,Tue Jan 06 20:35:42 +0000 2015,President Obama and the Democrat Party have made a religion out of opposing sensible energy policies.
552563970826330100,Tue Jan 06 20:34:51 +0000 2015,Unbelievable. Approving Keystone should be a no-brainer; It’s safe and it will create thousands of jobs.

540162137432539140,Wed Dec 03 15:14:23 +0000 2014,Pres Obama has governed as if he doesn’t believe in 2 critical foreign policy concepts: American exceptionalism, and peace through strength.

537723870611267600,Wed Nov 26 21:45:35 +0000 2014,He won't because his admin is full of ‘science deniers’ who want 2 make energy expensive &amp; push our country toward energy austerity.
537723700548624400,Wed Nov 26 21:44:55 +0000 2014,By embracing U.S. resources &amp; technological abilities, we can make energy cheaper &amp; more abundant. But President Obama won’t do it.
537723197685133300,Wed Nov 26 21:42:55 +0000 2014,Instead of pursuing the top-down energy policy of the Obama Admin, we should be on a path to an era of energy independence and job growth.
537723006647152640,Wed Nov 26 21:42:09 +0000 2014,That’s why he wants to force this new job-killing emission rule on the American people.
537722805140201500,Wed Nov 26 21:41:21 +0000 2014,President Obama doesn’t trust the American people or American companies. He believes Washington knows what’s best.
537722558754607100,Wed Nov 26 21:40:23 +0000 2014,It's exactly the type of policy and top-down governing that the American people rejected on Election Day a few weeks ago.
537722425962545150,Wed Nov 26 21:39:51 +0000 2014,The new emission plan would force companies to limit production that is vital to our economy and buy unnecessary, expensive technology.

535939976610193400,Fri Nov 21 23:37:02 +0000 2014,This arrogant, cynical, and political move by the President is why so many Americans no longer trust him to solve the problems we face.
535939858255314940,Fri Nov 21 23:36:34 +0000 2014,If the President wants to make the case that the law should be changed, he should go make the case to Congress and our people.
535939763279507460,Fri Nov 21 23:36:11 +0000 2014,Granting amnesty by executive order is wrong. It will incentivize more of this illegal immigration.
535939717045710850,Fri Nov 21 23:36:00 +0000 2014,I saw the crisis first hand over the summer — I went to the border. I saw folks illegally crossing it. We must secure the border.
535939658090561540,Fri Nov 21 23:35:46 +0000 2014,Fed Ex can track every package it ships, surely America can figure out who is crossing our borders.
535939592902688800,Fri Nov 21 23:35:30 +0000 2014,Our border is not secure. If we want to solve our immigration problem, job one is to secure the border.
535939530067828740,Fri Nov 21 23:35:15 +0000 2014,Unilaterally granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants does nothing to solve our immigration problem, it only makes it worse.
535939453903462400,Fri Nov 21 23:34:57 +0000 2014,The President is lecturing us and not listening to us. He’s bypassing Congress, and ignoring the American people.

533990694478553100,Sun Nov 16 14:31:17 +0000 2014,As states consider whether or not to expand Medicaid, we hear the old deceitful yarn – “hey, it’s free money from the federal government.”
533990503763546100,Sun Nov 16 14:30:31 +0000 2014,Louisiana tried government run health care for the last 50 years. It didn’t work.
533990466367131650,Sun Nov 16 14:30:22 +0000 2014,Medicaid expansion will cost Louisiana taxpayers up to $1.7 billion over ten years.
533990426282188800,Sun Nov 16 14:30:13 +0000 2014,Medicaid expansion would result in 248,000 leaving private insurance, putting half of Louisiana’s population on Medicaid.

532654142725320700,Wed Nov 12 22:00:18 +0000 2014,If @MaryLandrieu really cared about Louisiana, she would force a vote to approve the Keystone Pipeline AND repeal Obamacare.
532653978275045400,Wed Nov 12 21:59:39 +0000 2014,Well I guess a looming @MaryLandrieu defeat has made Senate Democrats reconsider the Keystone Pipeline. It’s about time.

532189189253906400,Tue Nov 11 15:12:44 +0000 2014,Every day should be Veterans Day here in America, because every day we are able to walk in freedom because of these military men and women.
532189106609344500,Tue Nov 11 15:12:25 +0000 2014,Today we honor our veterans for their service to our nation, but we don't have to wait until Veterans Day to honor and thank a veteran.

531911497812037600,Mon Nov 10 20:49:18 +0000 2014,She’s resorted to calling us racist for opposing President Obama’s policies.
531911430086619140,Mon Nov 10 20:49:02 +0000 2014,She’s failed to secure our border. She’s failed to protect Medicare for our seniors. She’s failed to protect our 2nd Amendment freedoms.

519162916088860700,Mon Oct 06 16:30:59 +0000 2014,It’s no accident that the threats to America – to its homeland and its national interests – are growing everywhere in the world.
519162671963582460,Mon Oct 06 16:30:01 +0000 2014,President Obama is the first president to not believe in American exceptionalism.

278604823866249200,Tue Dec 11 20:59:00 +0000 2012,Historically, K-12 education spending is considered an entitlement to school districts.  They think it’s “their” money.
