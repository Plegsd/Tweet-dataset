615920437424488400,Tue Jun 30 16:30:50 +0000 2015,You might ask about backup computer records of election results. By state law, counties only have to keep them for 2 years, so nothing.

614135638024130600,Thu Jun 25 18:18:40 +0000 2015,@pastaintdead thanks - it turns out we need to appeal to the Tillamook DA, so it might be out of their hands, but still worth the ask.
612438932769374200,Sun Jun 21 01:56:34 +0000 2015,Today we requested a Public Records Order from @ORDOJ to waive or reduce $664 fee set by Tillamook Co. for PDF copies of election results.
611964224357666800,Fri Jun 19 18:30:15 +0000 2015,Tillamook County tells us that they are "unable to waive the fees for your request." Next step is appealing to state officials.
