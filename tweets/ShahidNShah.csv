852944636465352700,Fri Apr 14 18:00:22 +0000 2017,This was fun, thanks @Availity for setting up the Quality Measures tweet chat and inviting us! Looking forward to next one. #askavaility
852944227076116500,Fri Apr 14 17:58:45 +0000 2017,A6: All measures must be built for the smallest first, if that doesn't work we shouldn't implement @freddwatters @dflee30 #askavaility
852943684056354800,Fri Apr 14 17:56:35 +0000 2017,A6: True @freddwatters but as NQF and other measures development teams rework their work products we could rethink approach. #askavaility
852943253246705700,Fri Apr 14 17:54:53 +0000 2017,T6: In my simulations, outcomes driven quality measures would be the #OKRs foundation for polices. Trip to mars is easier. #askavaility
852943017233305600,Fri Apr 14 17:53:56 +0000 2017,T6: My hope for future reforms is that we build full simulations for each policy proposal and test them before approving them.  #askavaility
852942887549628400,Fri Apr 14 17:53:25 +0000 2017,T6: Quality measures could significantly help with reforms but it's unclear which data can be trusted enough to affect policy #askavaility
852941797517127700,Fri Apr 14 17:49:06 +0000 2017,A5: @freddwatters reduction of errors would be a great quality measure :-) #askavaility
852941621050167300,Fri Apr 14 17:48:24 +0000 2017,A5: Right on, @dflee30 -- use-case-specific data integration is much better than wishful thinking around interoperability #askavaility
852941255818530800,Fri Apr 14 17:46:56 +0000 2017,A5: We hope healthcare altruism will encourage data sharing but simple capitalism and figuring out how to pay for data works #askavaility
852940964041809900,Fri Apr 14 17:45:47 +0000 2017,A5: After lack of shared goals &amp; limited population-based alignment, lack of data monetization around sharing is obstacle #askavaility
852940183469248500,Fri Apr 14 17:42:41 +0000 2017,A5: Interoperability in the absence of shared goals with measurable outcomes is a fool's errand and unachieveable any time soon #askavaility
852939974479577100,Fri Apr 14 17:41:51 +0000 2017,A5: Best way to get interoperability is focus on automated outcomes measures that cannot be generated w/out proper data sharing #askavaility

852939326111481900,Fri Apr 14 17:39:16 +0000 2017,A4: @dflee30 I know you well enough that I didn't think you reading a 1,000 page manual was sarcasm. You DO like that! :-) #askavaility
852939157487984600,Fri Apr 14 17:38:36 +0000 2017,T4: yes, @HIT_MMartin #healthplans can facility the way to interoperability via implicit data aggregation; EHRs remain behind  #askavaility
852938547883647000,Fri Apr 14 17:36:11 +0000 2017,T4: with proper data aggregation and automated cleansing and implicit identity resolutions we'll have better measures possible #askavaility
852938406397190100,Fri Apr 14 17:35:37 +0000 2017,T4: #machinelearning with implicit data aggregation will lead to interoperability - EHRs will not lead the way IMHO #askavaility
852938009217568800,Fri Apr 14 17:34:02 +0000 2017,A4: @freddwatters I'm pretty optimistic that once the gov't gets out of the way, EHRs will get overhauled due to demand #askavaility
852937505209032700,Fri Apr 14 17:32:02 +0000 2017,A4: EHRs, lab systems, IoT, medical device connectivity, and high volume data aggregation with #machinelearning are the future #askavaility
852937192280399900,Fri Apr 14 17:30:48 +0000 2017,A4: Over time, though, EHRs -- as they get better at improving their data quality -- will aid with measures automation #askavaility
852937051620220900,Fri Apr 14 17:30:14 +0000 2017,A4: Early on EHRs may make quality data even worse given copy/paste-itis of med records and lack of measure units alignment #askavaility
852936720379240400,Fri Apr 14 17:28:55 +0000 2017,A3: Without automation we have more "quality theatre" (pretending we know quality) more than anything else. #askavaility

852935985398677500,Fri Apr 14 17:26:00 +0000 2017,A3: Having far few measures that can be automated and trusted is better than dozens that are meaningless. #askavaility
852935856289611800,Fri Apr 14 17:25:29 +0000 2017,A3: We are in a world of quality measures reporting that is creating busy work without regard to quality of quality measures #askavaility
852935552198377500,Fri Apr 14 17:24:17 +0000 2017,A3: Anyone asking for non-automatable quality measures (including CMS) is asking for bad data that cannot be trusted #askavaility
852935431343755300,Fri Apr 14 17:23:48 +0000 2017,A3: @SKB_RnQ there's a lot of similarity on requests but not enough on the responses - providers understandably confused #askavaility
852935155354390500,Fri Apr 14 17:22:42 +0000 2017,A3: Medical IoT, device connectivity, lab data connectivity, are good measures automation techniques; aggregators can group 'em #askavaility
852934887644508200,Fri Apr 14 17:21:38 +0000 2017,A3: If automation requirements means reducing the number of measures, let's cut all human generated measures from contracts #askavaility
852934717670400000,Fri Apr 14 17:20:58 +0000 2017,A3: If measures are being reported manually then they should be deprioritized; only automated system-generated measures matter #askavaility
852934150193643500,Fri Apr 14 17:18:42 +0000 2017,A2: Problem with workflow based measures is that they're easy to turn into process measures which aren't ideal - need outcomes #askavaility

852932696812736500,Fri Apr 14 17:12:56 +0000 2017,A2: #healthplans/#providers data sharing is important because information asymmetry causes errors and misaligned priorities #askavaility
852932302594330600,Fri Apr 14 17:11:22 +0000 2017,A1: @wareFLO timely service is just as good an outcomes measure and something that's consumer centric so it should be priority #askavaility
852932163414700000,Fri Apr 14 17:10:49 +0000 2017,A1: @HIT_MMartin great point, it must be member satisfier and it's not hard to do if we prioritize the right measures. #askavaility
852931895713304600,Fri Apr 14 17:09:45 +0000 2017,A1: Right on, @SKB_RnQ plans need to drive leadership and definition of outcomes measures because they see more data #askavaility
852931602871091200,Fri Apr 14 17:08:35 +0000 2017,A1: Although we all like outcomes measures, we end up being lazy and come up with process measures. I wonder how we can change? #askavaility
852931206052290600,Fri Apr 14 17:07:00 +0000 2017,A1: If plans aren't focused on outcomes measures tied to things their consumer members care about, they're wasting their time. #askavaility
852930909166764000,Fri Apr 14 17:05:50 +0000 2017,A1: Focus on quality measures most important to consumers first, providers second, and then themselves as health plans last. #askavaility

753632886947995600,Thu Jul 14 16:50:56 +0000 2016,@shiny_penny @JohnWLewis @ShahidNshah General agreement in polite company is that patient owns the data; behind curtain is unclear #innochat
753631986229645300,Thu Jul 14 16:47:21 +0000 2016,@JohnWLewis agreed - every field is "special" but healthcare is different in one way: competitors are required to share more #innochat
753631811960463400,Thu Jul 14 16:46:40 +0000 2016,A4c The cloud is one example: healthcare will ultimately embrace the cloud but naysayers and #HIPAA silliness will cause delays #innochat
753631538240258000,Thu Jul 14 16:45:35 +0000 2016,What's unique/special in healthcare should help innovators build on top of other solutions but many HC execs don't buy them #innochat
753631342911492100,Thu Jul 14 16:44:48 +0000 2016,@JohnWLewis there's a lot special in healthcare (genomics, uniqueness of each individual) but it's used as a crutch #innochat
753631202637123600,Thu Jul 14 16:44:15 +0000 2016,A4b I think existing customer relationship/support &amp; other software can easily be used in healthcare but it's hard ton convince #innochat
753630798390104000,Thu Jul 14 16:42:38 +0000 2016,A4 healthcare is unfortunately a little averse of general purpose and open source software; HC execs think they're special :-) #innochat
753629919821852700,Thu Jul 14 16:39:09 +0000 2016,@shiny_penny great point about who defines outcomes -- it's one of our biggest challenges in #digitalhealth #innochat

753628000923619300,Thu Jul 14 16:31:31 +0000 2016,A3 Outcomes are not properly defined today: unless we get agreements on what "proper care" is in a quantifable way, we'll be stuck #innochat

753625530323304400,Thu Jul 14 16:21:42 +0000 2016,@JohnWLewis the problem is that many in healthcare know the right thing to do, they're wondering who will pay for the new work #innochat
753625356909867000,Thu Jul 14 16:21:01 +0000 2016,A2d Patients expect more from their providers than health plans are willing to pay for; docs get blamed for not doing unpaid work #innochat

753625067972595700,Thu Jul 14 16:19:52 +0000 2016,A2b Healthcare expects no workflow disruption: adoption challenge occurs if their workflow is changed even slightly #innochat
753624987160940500,Thu Jul 14 16:19:33 +0000 2016,A2 Healthcare expects proof: major adoption challenge is evidence that #digitalhealth really works and is not snake oil #innochat

753624036219969500,Thu Jul 14 16:15:46 +0000 2016,@quickmuse I think #FirstDoNoHarm is still the central philosophy of _care_ healthcare is more than just care, it's a business :-( #innochat
753623224685105200,Thu Jul 14 16:12:33 +0000 2016,A1  Here are most common #digitalhealth uses that patients want: education, instant diagnosis, plan selection, provider selection #innochat
753622959064027100,Thu Jul 14 16:11:29 +0000 2016,Actually @quickmuse sharing is in the ethos somewhat but #HIPAA and other regulations scare people into not sharing #innochat
753622744437256200,Thu Jul 14 16:10:38 +0000 2016,In healthcare, though, when a person goes from a small clinic to a big hospital to their insurance company website we expect share #innochat
753622626849919000,Thu Jul 14 16:10:10 +0000 2016,e.g. when a customer goes from one bank to another their entire financial record and buying history isn't expected to be shared.  #innochat
753622567882256400,Thu Jul 14 16:09:56 +0000 2016,Grt post @quickmuse, The difficulty is that, in healthcare, competitors need to share more information than in other industries  #innochat
753622294124257300,Thu Jul 14 16:08:51 +0000 2016,A1 For decades now we know how to do healthcare admin work but we're just learning how to take care of patients digitally. #innochat

753621214581690400,Thu Jul 14 16:04:33 +0000 2016,My colleagues in healthcare like to think that the industry is very different but of course it's not. It's very similar to others. #innochat

743114125333631000,Wed Jun 15 16:13:08 +0000 2016,A2 I think providers that think like payers &amp; payers that add clinical prevention services are likely the ones to lead innovation #hcbiz
743113857049198600,Wed Jun 15 16:12:04 +0000 2016,A1 I'm learning that if payers &amp; providers collaborate more directly on innovation, the issues of regulations can be minimized #hcbiz

720658118091399200,Thu Apr 14 17:00:59 +0000 2016,A6 Interesting idea @ShereesePubHlth - more stories about care providers might encourage care receivers to tell theirs #kareochat
720657214378283000,Thu Apr 14 16:57:23 +0000 2016,A6 It's possible that the reviews coming in (positive or negative) could be the anchor for some stories #kareochat
720656076883042300,Thu Apr 14 16:52:52 +0000 2016,A5 Tapping into emotions and feelings is worthy goal but be careful, it's what also has potential to accidentally offend #kareochat

720655247748833300,Thu Apr 14 16:49:34 +0000 2016,A5 Getting comm preferences is not easy; proper analytics &amp; surveying can draw those out quickly - it must be actively pursuied #kareochat
720654811549540400,Thu Apr 14 16:47:50 +0000 2016,A5 Knowing comm preferences is the only way to personalization; personalization is best way to engagement (the goal). Focus on it #kareochat
720653038554361900,Thu Apr 14 16:40:48 +0000 2016,A4 Using visuals that show coopetition by showing each others' value propositions makes for a compelling story #kareochat
720652927187202000,Thu Apr 14 16:40:21 +0000 2016,A4 Embrace coopetition in healthcare and increase trust among patients across multiple providers / practices #kareochat
720652707774771200,Thu Apr 14 16:39:29 +0000 2016,A4 What I mean by multiple providers advertising each other is that network effect is powerful and worth using - don't go alone #kareochat
720652585380810800,Thu Apr 14 16:39:00 +0000 2016,A4 Right on, @eVisit - new services, event reminders, etc. are great. Multiple practices should team up and advertise each other #kareochat
720652313006882800,Thu Apr 14 16:37:55 +0000 2016,A4 Visuals, like podcast discussion earlier, should be evaluated for time commitment and engagement - if higher, definitely do it #kareochat
720652170216022000,Thu Apr 14 16:37:21 +0000 2016,A4 ObGyns that pics on their wall of babies they deliver could do something similar in visuals digtially -- others can learn from #kareochat
720652029941715000,Thu Apr 14 16:36:47 +0000 2016,A4 Visuals take longer but have more retention - and more powerful. Many ObGyns have pics on their call of babies they deliver  #kareochat
720651775926267900,Thu Apr 14 16:35:47 +0000 2016,A4 Visual should be the focus of almost all content: starting with simple images, moving to infoGraphics, then to video is good  #kareochat

720650142861389800,Thu Apr 14 16:29:17 +0000 2016,You're right @Resultant -- a few videos vs. more audio podcasts might work better for most small practices #kareochat
720649955170512900,Thu Apr 14 16:28:32 +0000 2016,A3 When looking at podcasts compare the audience size, time commitment, and potential reach vs. other marCom techniques #kareochat
720649736445915100,Thu Apr 14 16:27:40 +0000 2016,A3 Be wary of podcast time commitment. At #HITMC we learned 3-4 minutes required per minute of broadcast #kareochat
720649313903358000,Thu Apr 14 16:26:00 +0000 2016,A3 Yes, podcasts for small practices would be great - especially if it's local and hyper targeted to specific communities #kareochat

720648202358255600,Thu Apr 14 16:21:35 +0000 2016,Excellent point @misterchambo, using reviews as a conversation starter and not a burden is a great idea #kareochat
720647946308612100,Thu Apr 14 16:20:34 +0000 2016,A2 right on, @eVisit showing how you respond is important - @mdeiner's word club from neg reviews was specifically useful #kareochat
720647395881709600,Thu Apr 14 16:18:22 +0000 2016,A2 Find reviews that show you listened (e.g. a problem was reported, corrected, and then patient re-reviewed). very powerful #kareochat
720647235701252100,Thu Apr 14 16:17:44 +0000 2016,A2 showing event some not so positive reviews on your site builds credibility but positive is of course the focus #kareochat
720646555771019300,Thu Apr 14 16:15:02 +0000 2016,T2 consider aggregating your reviews, along with competitors, and showing them on your site so that visitors don't leave to srch #kareochat
720646104426156000,Thu Apr 14 16:13:14 +0000 2016,Thanks for the reminder, @AmyinMaine - rebranding definitely isn't about "name" but about "identity" and how you're perceived #kareochat
720645904961839100,Thu Apr 14 16:12:27 +0000 2016,You're right @innonurse - re-positioning from treatment to prevention is a great time to rebrand #kareochat
720645662392610800,Thu Apr 14 16:11:29 +0000 2016,A1 market positioning by specialty, by disease condition focus, by demographics, etc. all require branding considerations #kareochat
720645322863681500,Thu Apr 14 16:10:08 +0000 2016,A1 when an "institutional update" occurs it's worth seeing whether the old brand will maintain success or it might hamper it #kareochat
720645168345522200,Thu Apr 14 16:09:31 +0000 2016,A1 mergers, acquisitions, and splits are becoming more common; each time one occurs it's good to consider rebranding #kareochat

710511653490708500,Thu Mar 17 17:02:33 +0000 2016,Thanks @IronMtnHealth for leading this very important topic - we're all busy generating data but we need help managing it! #infotalk
710511434594132000,Thu Mar 17 17:01:41 +0000 2016,A6: In scenarios where data is digitally native (not imported/exported/transformed) and used daily, the quality is reasonable.  #infotalk
710510135605653500,Thu Mar 17 16:56:31 +0000 2016,@KarenSnyder2 errors in data are tolerated when it's not used to make crucial decisions and IG/DG is opaque @bellemeehan2 #infotalk
710509862564798500,Thu Mar 17 16:55:26 +0000 2016,A5: In some data sharing use cases identity is crticial; leaders should prioritize evidence driven decisions without, if possible #infotalk
710509535027396600,Thu Mar 17 16:54:08 +0000 2016,A5: In many popHealth uses cases, identity is crucial; in others it's not. Given how hard PII matching is, smart to separate #infotalk
710509065282195500,Thu Mar 17 16:52:16 +0000 2016,A5: Good IG/DG leadership knows how to separate identity-forcing functions from non-attribution for security/lifecycle/etc. #infotalk
710508773538975700,Thu Mar 17 16:51:06 +0000 2016,A5: If attribution required, PII and EMPIs are crucial - but, many of our immediate DG/IG needs can be handled without attribution #infotalk
710507809453056000,Thu Mar 17 16:47:17 +0000 2016,A4: We sit in IG/DG meetings discussing quality esoterically; instead, focus on uses/impact/outcomes of data as quality definition #infotalk
710507482561515500,Thu Mar 17 16:45:59 +0000 2016,@bellemeehan2 If data is paired w/self-service (SS) tech is put into hands of users then lots can be done; if not SS, we're behind #infotalk
710507068776718300,Thu Mar 17 16:44:20 +0000 2016,A4: Basically, if decision makers and line of business personnel cannot use data, it's low quality and DG / IG efforts are failing #infotalk
710506886265741300,Thu Mar 17 16:43:36 +0000 2016,A4: In my data debates I say that if you can make evidence driven decisions off data, it's got quality -- if not, it doesn't #infotalk
710506661681754100,Thu Mar 17 16:42:43 +0000 2016,A4: For example: data quality is to data what software quality is software: is it about tech or about what can be done w/ data? #infotalk
710506478243868700,Thu Mar 17 16:41:59 +0000 2016,A4: Data quality, if determined by the decisions that can be made from data, could be easier than we think #infotalk
710506374678093800,Thu Mar 17 16:41:34 +0000 2016,A4: Everyone believes quality is important but technically it requires provenance &amp; other details that are unavailable today #infotalk
710506029419794400,Thu Mar 17 16:40:12 +0000 2016,@KarenSnyder2 IG has far more progress because it's about human2human communications; DG is more about machine/tech &amp; harder #infotalk

710505293881417700,Thu Mar 17 16:37:17 +0000 2016,@KarenSnyder2 quite right, @techguy and I see many health systems already have notional DG and IG efforts underway &amp; growing #infotalk
710504312561127400,Thu Mar 17 16:33:23 +0000 2016,A3: Another DG struggle: data definitions &amp; models were created in static non-digital-native days &amp; now we're in another world #infotalk
710503962370285600,Thu Mar 17 16:31:59 +0000 2016,A3: The struggle with DG has been more new data is coming in faster than inventory and mapping can be done #infotalk

710503518021554200,Thu Mar 17 16:30:13 +0000 2016,A3: Most of DG work I do is: concept mapping -&gt; inventory sources -&gt; map structs -&gt; establish data lifecycle -&gt; map workflows #infotalk
710502631177846800,Thu Mar 17 16:26:42 +0000 2016,@KarenSnyder2 I think DG about data inventory, integ., lifecycle, wrkflw, etc. but IG much more about how to convey data to humans #infotalk
710501947871268900,Thu Mar 17 16:23:59 +0000 2016,A2: If we say IG and DG are really about "insight governance" or "impact governance" leaders can focus on outcomes vs. process #infotalk
710501700105273300,Thu Mar 17 16:23:00 +0000 2016,A2: Great point @techguy, the common math in KM is knowledge = data + context + insight; our target should be knowledge / insight #infotalk
710501300388151300,Thu Mar 17 16:21:25 +0000 2016,A2: At #HIMSS16 spoke with Sutter Health and they had great approach: governance focused on highest impact, not best management #infotalk
710500970019602400,Thu Mar 17 16:20:06 +0000 2016,A2: DG should be led by technical experts with data architecture skills; IG should be led by clinicians, quality, and front line #infotalk
710500778859954200,Thu Mar 17 16:19:20 +0000 2016,A2: I think the best IG leaders are those who are required to derive high impact value from data and information; not tech leaders #infotalk
710499979148841000,Thu Mar 17 16:16:10 +0000 2016,A1. Do we buy the argument that "Information = Data + Context"? See: https://t.co/fpB2Q6o590 #infotalk
710499602185756700,Thu Mar 17 16:14:40 +0000 2016,A1: I'm at VHA today; we discussed IG vs. DG for health system facilities. We debated &amp; concluded IG &amp; DG related but orthogonal #infotalk
710499226099261400,Thu Mar 17 16:13:10 +0000 2016,@techguy makes a good point -- could you have IG without DG?  #infotalk
710499090652663800,Thu Mar 17 16:12:38 +0000 2016,@bellemeehan2 quite right, IG is all information -- but I think DG can live without clinical specialists longer than IG can #infotalk
710498870040600600,Thu Mar 17 16:11:45 +0000 2016,@IM_ElissaRobins I agree that accountability and rights of decision is great way to distinguish DG vs. IG #infotalk
710498621045776400,Thu Mar 17 16:10:46 +0000 2016,@nancytwombly I really like your separation of DG's focus on integrity, completeness, access, and security. very nice. #infotalk
710498372818505700,Thu Mar 17 16:09:47 +0000 2016,A1: I like to think that data governance can be done by data specialists but IG requires clinical specialists #infotalk
710498192266240000,Thu Mar 17 16:09:04 +0000 2016,A1: Since Information "is data put in context" I think governance of each type is similar https://t.co/fpB2Q6o590  #infotalk

656514286316068900,Tue Oct 20 16:56:17 +0000 2015,A4: @MichaelGaspar makes grt point -- prioritization is required, all data loss isn't the same (some can kill, most don't) #connect2health
656513929309495300,Tue Oct 20 16:54:52 +0000 2015,@SullyHIT would be great to talk about that possibility at upcoming https://t.co/yJnYUGQjSB in November #connect2health
656513392023371800,Tue Oct 20 16:52:44 +0000 2015,A4: @OchoTex great point! data handling and clinical safety go hand in hand these days, especially with #EHR #connect2health
656513058207043600,Tue Oct 20 16:51:25 +0000 2015,A4: it's technically possible to keep patients safe &amp; protect their health data with proper #metadata and permissions #connect2health

656510831509815300,Tue Oct 20 16:42:34 +0000 2015,@MichaelGaspar I think most healthy people don't care. It's the unhealthy fearing discrimination that prolly care most. #connect2health
656510441032675300,Tue Oct 20 16:41:01 +0000 2015,@healthblawg, grt point. Privacy requirements go down with better anti-discrim laws. @HIMSS policy team is prolly on it! #connect2health
656510010399313900,Tue Oct 20 16:39:18 +0000 2015,A3: @haroldsmith3rd @JoannKlinedinst we should FMEA analysis model for input validation and verification #connect2health
656509786180210700,Tue Oct 20 16:38:25 +0000 2015,@haroldsmith3rd  @JoannKlinedinst totally agree -- a "collector" that can kill is still a "killer" :-) #connect2health
656509667078742000,Tue Oct 20 16:37:56 +0000 2015,A3: Risk management works best when we prioritize the possible/impossible, securable/insecurable, etc. #connect2health
656509345199431700,Tue Oct 20 16:36:39 +0000 2015,@JoannKlinedinst agree it's important, but #HIPAAsilliness occurs when we treat device that kills the same as info collector #connect2health
656509158561333200,Tue Oct 20 16:35:55 +0000 2015,A3: Most #EHR apps written in an era with fewer clinical users, now expanding to more non-clinical users and combing orders #connect2health
656508986078994400,Tue Oct 20 16:35:14 +0000 2015,A3: #EHR apps are actually a bit more dangerous than we give them credit -- need more security than we have #connect2health
656508759787839500,Tue Oct 20 16:34:20 +0000 2015,A3: if devices merely collect information, they should be prioritized lower #connect2health
656508687817777200,Tue Oct 20 16:34:03 +0000 2015,A3: we should prioritize security for devices that can a) kill, b) harm, and c) affect real health &amp; well being #connect2health
656508443843534800,Tue Oct 20 16:33:05 +0000 2015,A3: I like what @RisknCompliance said: "need good preventative controls but even better response capabilities" per device  #connect2health
656508113344970800,Tue Oct 20 16:31:46 +0000 2015,@JoannKlinedinst @SullyHIT  @HIMSS Yeah, "assuming" is not a good thing to do -- good research required #connect2health
656507784754823200,Tue Oct 20 16:30:27 +0000 2015,@MichaelGaspar healthy people don't mind allergies being breached. but if you're allergic to an HIV med it leaks real info! #connect2health
656507470022578200,Tue Oct 20 16:29:12 +0000 2015,@jsabbah we should run poll on one of the @HIMSS sites asking how many consumers believe their data is already breached #connect2health
656507253093191700,Tue Oct 20 16:28:21 +0000 2015,@haroldsmith3rd  quite right that once med rec genie is out, can't put back into bottle. #connect2health
656507045257072600,Tue Oct 20 16:27:31 +0000 2015,@AhmHashem I think you're right -- we're getting slowly conditioned to lower privacy bars. I feel like frog being boiled #connect2health
656506706474700800,Tue Oct 20 16:26:10 +0000 2015,@HIMSS Is it possible that consumers are just assuming breaches but get enough value to continue engaging?  #connect2health
656506513788375000,Tue Oct 20 16:25:24 +0000 2015,@SullyHIT ooh, I love that hash tag! #HIPAAsilliness -- let's use it! :-) #connect2health
656506381151903700,Tue Oct 20 16:24:53 +0000 2015,IA2: Engagement in health, finance &amp; others still strong and growing in spite of breaches. We'll pay for it someday  #connect2health
656506150062530600,Tue Oct 20 16:23:58 +0000 2015,A2: I think not enough research available but so far it appears breaches haven't reduced engagement much #connect2health
656505755277918200,Tue Oct 20 16:22:24 +0000 2015,@JoannKlinedinst great point, board seat for CISO is good but they need to be open minded and "outside in" thinker #connect2health
656505438691795000,Tue Oct 20 16:21:08 +0000 2015,@JoannKlinedinst @JohnSharp @SullyHIT agreed, simple stuff is best. #HIPAA silliness leads to focus on wrong tasks #connect2health
656505150513750000,Tue Oct 20 16:19:59 +0000 2015,@JohnSharp I love that idea. Security training for #HIPAA should be similar to what it is for classified information #connect2health
656505016145027100,Tue Oct 20 16:19:27 +0000 2015,A1: another "best practice" is setting up weekly or monthly breach attempt reviews with non-tech staff #connect2health
656504606923628500,Tue Oct 20 16:17:50 +0000 2015,@SullyHIT I wish other firms were doing what Henry Ford is. Without new tools, even minimal training will improve risk #connect2health
656504162658721800,Tue Oct 20 16:16:04 +0000 2015,@haroldsmith3rd @dflee30 totally agree that CISO needs seat at C-suite table but only if it's business-centric CISO #connect2health
656503999529680900,Tue Oct 20 16:15:25 +0000 2015,@haroldsmith3rd that's the checklist mentality that @healthblawg is cautioning against.  #connect2health

560495700543557600,Wed Jan 28 17:52:43 +0000 2015,A6: Our database vendors aren't #InfoGov partners yet; need to help them integrate properly #infotalk
560495567282118660,Wed Jan 28 17:52:11 +0000 2015,A6: We've got to add metadata management into our data stores so that provenance matches #InfoGov requirements #infotalk
560495418086527000,Wed Jan 28 17:51:35 +0000 2015,A6: Treating all data as the same causes improper technology strategy -- #InfoGov will teach us how to properly segment #infotalk
560495239165915140,Wed Jan 28 17:50:53 +0000 2015,A6: Healthcare IG prolly need to create proper data lakes: phenotypic, genotypic, administrative, etc. &amp; #InfoGov the lakes #infotalk

560494163436011500,Wed Jan 28 17:46:36 +0000 2015,A5: When HIM professionals stop talking about their jobs and focus on patient outcomes, enterprises will buy in #infotalk

560492802040410100,Wed Jan 28 17:41:12 +0000 2015,A4: Even 5 years from now, integrating paper native responsibilities with digital native #InfoGov will be challenging #infotalk
560492462574436350,Wed Jan 28 17:39:51 +0000 2015,A4: Agreed, @KarenSnyder2 -- we can't forget that paper is still a large part of HIM responsibilities even today #infotalk
560491768794611700,Wed Jan 28 17:37:05 +0000 2015,A4: Today challenge is that HIM has existing paper native responsibilities PLUS worry about new digital native requirements #infotalk
560491544944603140,Wed Jan 28 17:36:12 +0000 2015,A4: Today challenge is that HIM needs to know data loss prevention (DLP) but may not be trained to do so #infotalk

560491207558983700,Wed Jan 28 17:34:51 +0000 2015,A4: Tomorrow challenge is whether HIM job will be integrated on the IT side or the clinical side, both are causes for concern #infotalk
560491095227129860,Wed Jan 28 17:34:25 +0000 2015,A4: Today challenge is that HIM job is often seen in terms of paper when digital creates new opportunities / concerns #infotalk
560491062947770400,Wed Jan 28 17:34:17 +0000 2015,A4: Very few databases and tools are in place to help with #InfoGov, only storage and querying and not data solutions #infotalk
560490824128270340,Wed Jan 28 17:33:20 +0000 2015,A4: Today challenge is that HIM roles don't have enough knowledge of deep database tech but need to solve data issues #infotalk

560487755856482300,Wed Jan 28 17:21:09 +0000 2015,@LydiaWashing000 you're absolutely right. Lack of positive patient ID is an emergent risk caused by low/poor #InfoGov capability #infotalk
560487329014751200,Wed Jan 28 17:19:27 +0000 2015,A2: Even modern databases and tools are risky 'cause they don't assist with #InfoGov, making compliance hard #infotalk
560486915292815360,Wed Jan 28 17:17:48 +0000 2015,A2: Biggest risks in digital native are volume and variety, no #InfoGov means poor compliance #infotalk

560130440099811300,Tue Jan 27 17:41:18 +0000 2015,A4: I think we're relying too much on social online tools -- email is far more useful in digital health marketing than we admit  #hitmc
560128323633041400,Tue Jan 27 17:32:53 +0000 2015,A3: I think combining social selling + social marketing + consultative audio/video content has helped simplify complex topics.  #hitmc

520251400732028900,Thu Oct 09 16:36:14 +0000 2014,A4: 1 - attention for #InfoGov hard because #EHR sucks oxygen from strategic planning and execution #KareoChat

520250378928263200,Thu Oct 09 16:32:10 +0000 2014,A3: Unless we focus on patient safety, clinical outcomes, etc. that can only come with data sharing, #HIPAA wins we lose #KareoChat

520249420940857340,Thu Oct 09 16:28:22 +0000 2014,A3: Until we revamp #HIPAA, we can use #InfoGov to create data sharing agreement templates, collaboration guidelines , etc.  #KareoChat
520249044493684740,Thu Oct 09 16:26:52 +0000 2014,A3: If we can revamp #HIPAA so that it's more about structure privacy and real security then #InfoGov will benefit from it. #KareoChat
520248918765240300,Thu Oct 09 16:26:22 +0000 2014,A3: Whenever I see someone wanting to do the right thing #HIPAA is more often a roadblock to value than a privacy enhancer #KareoChat
520248785365368800,Thu Oct 09 16:25:50 +0000 2014,A3: HIPAA is one of the worst things to happen to #InfoGov because it's a "feel good" compliance activity, not useful security  #KareoChat

520247223951826940,Thu Oct 09 16:19:38 +0000 2014,A2: But not just #EHR an issue, all new #healthIT and #DigitalHealth disparate silos create #InfoGov problems needing solution #KareoChat
520246978253688800,Thu Oct 09 16:18:39 +0000 2014,A2: #EHR has all the mind share today but when we wake up from MU hangover we'll realize it we're behing in #infoGov 'cause of it #KareoChat
520246624954884100,Thu Oct 09 16:17:15 +0000 2014,A2: @IronMtnHealth quite right the HIM pro role must grow in both importance and stature because #EHR is another data store #KareoChat
520246340048420860,Thu Oct 09 16:16:07 +0000 2014,A2: the rise of #EHR creates more need for IG but will also slow down its adoption because data is supposedly in one place #KareoChat
520246131243356160,Thu Oct 09 16:15:18 +0000 2014,When we govern money, we have a basic chart of accounts; perhaps that's what we need in IG - a "chart of data" assets first #KareoChat
520245868034023400,Thu Oct 09 16:14:15 +0000 2014,Because we know money is important, nobody questions its governance. IG adoption is low because data is not as important as money #KareoChat
520245695526486000,Thu Oct 09 16:13:34 +0000 2014,Having to justify #InfoGov for data assets would be like having to justify MoneyGov to "govern" use of funds, money, etc. #KareoChat
520245471852642300,Thu Oct 09 16:12:40 +0000 2014,@askjoyrios agreed! Treat data as assets, see what the return on assets are, then "govern" and "enginneer" info assets #KareoChat
520244978287927300,Thu Oct 09 16:10:43 +0000 2014,If info/data is treated like money or assets then #InfoGov is naturally doing for data what financials do for money #KareoChat
520244780316778500,Thu Oct 09 16:09:55 +0000 2014,Too much of #InfoGov has been treated as an expense, looking for ROI; it should be an asset definition &amp; allocation strategy #KareoChat
520244580693057540,Thu Oct 09 16:09:08 +0000 2014,@KarenSnyder2 my definition of #InfoGov starts with building "info/data as an asset" strategy followed by engineering tools #KareoChat
520244036733792260,Thu Oct 09 16:06:58 +0000 2014,Adoption of anything in tech is determined by value. To date #InfoGov hasn't shown value but that's changing. #KareoChat
520243854487076860,Thu Oct 09 16:06:15 +0000 2014,I think we have #InfoGov for specific specialties, specific participants, etc. first and then grow from there we'll see success #KareoChat
520243683103633400,Thu Oct 09 16:05:34 +0000 2014,#InfoGov is less adopted because the number of participants and different kinds of participants is quite varied. #KareoChat

510471810534883300,Fri Sep 12 16:55:38 +0000 2014,A3: @GetWellNetwork well said, leadership drives results...perhaps we need some focused events? #HITsm #DHSCP
510471244584857600,Fri Sep 12 16:53:23 +0000 2014,A5: To get the unknowns to be knowns, let's keep sharing vendors and tools in this space #HITsm #DHSCP
510470882431868900,Fri Sep 12 16:51:57 +0000 2014,@ehrandhit neat -- would love to hear more from 3Pas about what they're doing. More we share, the more we win/hackers lose. #HITsm #DHSCP
510470635261542400,Fri Sep 12 16:50:58 +0000 2014,@HealthIsCool @scramblage might be useful for quick medical image sharing between healthcare professionals #HITsm #DHSCP

510470257056948200,Fri Sep 12 16:49:28 +0000 2014,A5: could we create a site some to share the "unknowns" so they become know? Some #security vendors who under deep healthcare? #HITsm #DHSCP

510469093376675840,Fri Sep 12 16:44:50 +0000 2014,@foxggf @Cascadia thanks, though it seems "breach" is not defined in there. #HITsm #DHSCP

510468434422169600,Fri Sep 12 16:42:13 +0000 2014,A3: @GetWellNetwork excellent idea, do you guys have posts or public guidance of how to do that "day 1" privacy protection? #HITsm #DHSCP
510468142054006800,Fri Sep 12 16:41:03 +0000 2014,A4: @RightPatient nice suggestion; seen any examples you can share of a breach-focused crisis management plan? #HITsm #DHSCP
510467989314232300,Fri Sep 12 16:40:27 +0000 2014,A4: Anyone know where "breach" is defined per #HIPAA requirements? #HITsm #DHSCP
510467794060980200,Fri Sep 12 16:39:40 +0000 2014,@wareFLO @HealthEDena lovely points -- security is an "emergent property" of a system, driven by workflows #HITsm #DHSCP

510467012129484800,Fri Sep 12 16:36:34 +0000 2014,@ehrandhit maybe we need #security ratings for hospitals? #HITsm #DHSCP
510466833208848400,Fri Sep 12 16:35:51 +0000 2014,A3: @OchoTex @leonardkish these kinds of talks are important to get the culture discussions started; events good, too. #HITsm #DHSCP
510466646457475100,Fri Sep 12 16:35:07 +0000 2014,@dz45tr nice point -- there is no 100% security so we need to figure out how to get as close as possible but deal with rest #HITsm #DHSCP
510466414260805600,Fri Sep 12 16:34:11 +0000 2014,@wareFLO @uuAbility I'm in for a #HITsm #DHSCP tweet up for sure.
510466249860841500,Fri Sep 12 16:33:32 +0000 2014,A3: @RightPatient right clear consequences can drive behavior; loose security policies don't have immediate harm so it's hard #HITsm #DHSCP
510465920037584900,Fri Sep 12 16:32:13 +0000 2014,A3: @Colin_Hung I like that idea quite a bit. Personal stories shared about breaches' harm would be powerful. #HITsm #DHSCP
510465706744639500,Fri Sep 12 16:31:23 +0000 2014,A3: @dz45tr great point - if we're serious about #security other industries can learn from us because our data is complicated #HITsm #DHSCP
510465535893864450,Fri Sep 12 16:30:42 +0000 2014,A3: @mpanner quite right, #HIPAA is no longer common sense for #security so we need to look towards #OWASP and others #HITsm #DHSCP
510465535893864450,Fri Sep 12 16:30:42 +0000 2014,A3: @mpanner quite right, #HIPAA is no longer common sense for #security so we need to look towards #OWASP and others #HITsm #DHSCP
510465260349063200,Fri Sep 12 16:29:36 +0000 2014,A3: @ErinHead_HIM is right - auditing safeguars, risk-based monitoring, and culture-shocking punishment for breaches necessary #HITsm #DHSCP
510464970547789800,Fri Sep 12 16:28:27 +0000 2014,A3: "Culture eats strategy for lunch" so if we're focused on compliance, that's what we'll get. We have insecure compliance #HITsm #DHSCP
510464732382638100,Fri Sep 12 16:27:30 +0000 2014,A3: @dflee30, I agree with @techguy. Our culture is of permissions-oriented compliance and not #security - big weakness. #HITsm #DHSCP
510464158765416450,Fri Sep 12 16:25:14 +0000 2014,A2: Agree with @danmunro, can't beat hackers but we have to act like them when designing/engineering our #healthIT apps #HITsm #DHSCP
510463553653198850,Fri Sep 12 16:22:49 +0000 2014,A2: @Cascadia correct - #HIPAA is a fine compliance and "rights" statute; but we want to be sure not confuse it with #security #HITsm #DHSCP
510463320949006340,Fri Sep 12 16:21:54 +0000 2014,A2: @dz45tr awesome point, we need to be more clever than hackers so it means going beyond standards #HITsm #DHSCP
510463143160868860,Fri Sep 12 16:21:11 +0000 2014,@danmunro sure, a webinar showing tools/sites and how real hacks lead to real threats and harm would be great #HITsm #DHSCP
510462924876693500,Fri Sep 12 16:20:19 +0000 2014,A2 @JulieWMaas great point; seen any good examples of the infosec policy templates covering real security (not #HIPAA)? #HITsm #DHSCP
510462714351988740,Fri Sep 12 16:19:29 +0000 2014,A1: @mpanner completely agree; "security standards" just fancy word for "compliance" -- hackers don't care about standards #HITsm #DHSCP
510462529852940300,Fri Sep 12 16:18:45 +0000 2014,@2healthguru welcome! Ask the #TEDMED folks about whether #HIPAA means #security or just compliance :-) #HITsm #DHSCP
510462360143007740,Fri Sep 12 16:18:05 +0000 2014,A2: Yes, we have to switch #HIPAA from a compliance requirement to a real #security workflow and plan #HITsm #DHSCP
510461986917089300,Fri Sep 12 16:16:36 +0000 2014,A1: @danmunro beautiful example of SS# availability. Perhaps we can give other examples to show demand and supply to execs #HITsm #DHSCP
510461451753242600,Fri Sep 12 16:14:28 +0000 2014,T1: @haroldsmith3rd yeah, those are the things we're less focused on because we're completed swamped with #HIPAA BS #HITsm #DHSCP
510461292432613400,Fri Sep 12 16:13:50 +0000 2014,T1: @Colin_Hung great point, simple data leakage is also a breach. #HITsm #DHSCP
510461140678475800,Fri Sep 12 16:13:14 +0000 2014,T1: @SquakMtn I tend to agree; that's why we need to make sure #security plans is based on real threat models and risk #HITsm #DHSCP
510460771604922400,Fri Sep 12 16:11:46 +0000 2014,T1: DICOMGrid do you think health insurers risk is as bad now with ACA's changed pre-existing conditions rules? #HITsm #DHSCP
510460516180185100,Fri Sep 12 16:10:45 +0000 2014,T1: @Colin_Hung lovely point about wrong treatments. Real risk vs. compliance risk! #HITsm #DHSCP
510460353596387300,Fri Sep 12 16:10:06 +0000 2014,@jeanettegtf great point, do you think the "not useful" data is less prone to risk? Interesting. #HITsm #DHSCP
510460132342657000,Fri Sep 12 16:09:14 +0000 2014,T1: @mpanner Interesting flip of the Q, please elaborate!  #HITsm #DHSCP
510459823910322200,Fri Sep 12 16:08:00 +0000 2014,T1: #HIPAA deals with some of the privacy issues but we need to focus on threat models that are risk-centered (not compliance) #HITsm #DHSCP
510459686551056400,Fri Sep 12 16:07:27 +0000 2014,T1: The third risk is in data leakage and patient identity and health data being compromised causing financial harm #HITsm #DHSCP
510459468111679500,Fri Sep 12 16:06:35 +0000 2014,T1: The second risk is in #privacy reduction that causes patients to not share information with care providers #HITsm #DHSCP
510459301006422000,Fri Sep 12 16:05:55 +0000 2014,T1: The first safety risk we should see is in med devices and #EHR data confidence. If we can't trust data, it's not useful. #HITsm #DHSCP
510459062358917100,Fri Sep 12 16:04:59 +0000 2014,Let us know if you're an expert, we could use real #security and #hacking gurus for the community to depend upon! #HITsm #DHSCP

506496724547149800,Mon Sep 01 17:40:04 +0000 2014,@ChadCasady glad to hear it; we need to make sure we're doing threat-modeled #encryption with real security not just #HIPAA compliance

482220711957004300,Thu Jun 26 17:55:51 +0000 2014,@ehrandhit @FDB_US try custom landing pages per campaign or per audience / specialty to do easy measurements.
482220485296803840,Thu Jun 26 17:54:57 +0000 2014,Listening allows audiences to inform your marketing calendar, event participation, tell you about problems, solutions sought, etc. #HITMC
482220146082451460,Thu Jun 26 17:53:36 +0000 2014,Listening allows you to develop a better audience and find out their problems; you can solve issues or provide better content. #HITMC
482220033524105200,Thu Jun 26 17:53:09 +0000 2014,T5: Recognize that nobody cares about you or your company. Not listening confirms people’s suspicions about your inauthenticity. #HITMC
482219654728134660,Thu Jun 26 17:51:39 +0000 2014,People, especially B2B, only buys from you when you're authentic and believable because mission critical jobs are at stack. #HITMC
482219506019090400,Thu Jun 26 17:51:04 +0000 2014,Listening allows you to demonstrate authenticity, which builds confidence in your brand, which makes you believable. #HITMC
482219449580527600,Thu Jun 26 17:50:50 +0000 2014,If you don't listen, you're talking. Usually when you talk without listening you focus on the wrong person (yourself). #HITMC
482219413522116600,Thu Jun 26 17:50:42 +0000 2014,There is no such thing as social marketing or social selling without listening.  #HITMC
482218850164146200,Thu Jun 26 17:48:27 +0000 2014,@jslentzclifton indeed, evergreen content should be initial goal for most B2B marcomm deliverables. Content must age like fine wine #HITMC
482217869779157000,Thu Jun 26 17:44:33 +0000 2014,All of us have jobs to do during the day; the content that helps eliminate some research we have to do or finish a job wins. big. #HITMC
482217791299551200,Thu Jun 26 17:44:15 +0000 2014,If you know your audience, their roles, their responsibilities, etc. content can teach them something or lighten their research load. #HITMC
482217671501811700,Thu Jun 26 17:43:46 +0000 2014,T4: Successful content will saved, e-mailed, or shared in some way. If your content isn't saved or shared consider it a failure. #HITMC
482217605252780000,Thu Jun 26 17:43:30 +0000 2014,T4: In B2B, focus on content that is meant to help someone get their job done, not just entertain or enlighten to just give news. #HITMC
482217541717475300,Thu Jun 26 17:43:15 +0000 2014,T4: News &amp; views content is less useful and not as evergreen as actionable advice or content meant to teach something. #HITMC
482217409261371400,Thu Jun 26 17:42:44 +0000 2014,Let's not dish cold calling &amp; cold visits; they're less sexy but as effective or more so than social for some audiences. #HITMC
482216958927331300,Thu Jun 26 17:40:56 +0000 2014,@billians right on clients choose you for attitude but i suspect 'fun' comes after credible, authentic, believable. :-) #HITMC
482216636746043400,Thu Jun 26 17:39:40 +0000 2014,@mpanner In regulatory environments like #HealthIT we often confuse "gov't requirement" with "value". If we tell B2B the truth we win #HITMC
482216135908397060,Thu Jun 26 17:37:40 +0000 2014,@NateKSU @ehrandhit anything that makes work fun is absolutely worth trying. No question that social has that compelling facet. #HITMC
482215863966519300,Thu Jun 26 17:36:35 +0000 2014,I guess lone infographics might be entertainment but when coupled with solid content (T4) they are terrific at explaining complexity #HITMC
482215514182520800,Thu Jun 26 17:35:12 +0000 2014,@billians interesting, I might need to focus more on infographics; i was wondering if their time has passed but I guess not! #HITMC
482215110237511700,Thu Jun 26 17:33:36 +0000 2014,@billians curious about  engagement you see with infographics; B2B buyers need explanations, infographics seem to be entertainment #HITMC
482214644732690400,Thu Jun 26 17:31:45 +0000 2014,@UofUHealthCare beautiful strategy: Twitter to attract, FB to connect. Add org-specific responsibilities into the mix and it's potent #HITMC
482214123271634940,Thu Jun 26 17:29:40 +0000 2014,T3: Once you know the organizational responsibilities and purchasing decision, budgeting, then use that to inform FaceBook content. #HITMC
482214023182946300,Thu Jun 26 17:29:16 +0000 2014,B2B is still a person to person sale but the person you're selling has an organizational responsibility to be considered. #HITMC
482213924100915200,Thu Jun 26 17:28:53 +0000 2014,T3: To reach healthcare company staff peronally, FB good &amp; to start audience-specific discussions around specific jobs and problems. #HITMC
482213822347096060,Thu Jun 26 17:28:29 +0000 2014,@billians excellent idea; use FB for general communications rather than specific solutions or actionable advice. #HITMC
482213645548793860,Thu Jun 26 17:27:46 +0000 2014,T3: FB is best used for B2C (patient) as opposed to B2B but is useful in certain B2B circles when dealing with healthcare staff. #HITMC
482213423728820200,Thu Jun 26 17:26:53 +0000 2014,@DICOMGrid no controversy that FaceBook is good for some B2C but not for all B2B. B2B buyers are looking for solutions to problems #HITMC
482213228903411700,Thu Jun 26 17:26:07 +0000 2014,@FDB_US  is measurement that important for truly social conversations? How do we measure word of mouth? Is social similar? #HITMC
482212981930205200,Thu Jun 26 17:25:08 +0000 2014,@billians great advice about not being on all channels, good example is that in B2B FaceBook might be as good as it is for B2C. #HITMC
482212724479643650,Thu Jun 26 17:24:07 +0000 2014,T2: Don't choose medium &amp; jump in first, create audience development and community participation plan, topics, trends, etc. first #HITMC
482212564685062140,Thu Jun 26 17:23:29 +0000 2014,Once you know your audience and how you'd specifically like them to participate then choose medium - FB, LinkedIn, Twitter, Blogs #HITMC
482212371927412740,Thu Jun 26 17:22:43 +0000 2014,T2: don't just figure out what you want tell the audience, that's not social. Purpose for conversation and participation is social. #HITMC
482212156558290940,Thu Jun 26 17:21:51 +0000 2014,@jslentzclifton @billians right, real people are more approachable but not only if they're interesting but when they solve problems #HITMC
482211887418200060,Thu Jun 26 17:20:47 +0000 2014,T2: For example, if you want test out responses to sales objections build an audience strategy for that purpose. #HITMC
482211774234898400,Thu Jun 26 17:20:20 +0000 2014,T3: Craft a simple marketing messaging document that considers audience participation and what you'd like to hear from them. #HITMC
482211696808034300,Thu Jun 26 17:20:02 +0000 2014,T2: In the imagined event think about why people would come to your event (social is about "events" and "audience"). #HITMC
482211632106704900,Thu Jun 26 17:19:46 +0000 2014,T2: Imagine creating an event and consider what kind of audience you'd like to talk with; develop messaging around that audience. #HITMC
482211189540544500,Thu Jun 26 17:18:01 +0000 2014,When describing solutions, figure out what kind of audience participation around sales objections and clarifications is necessary. #HITMC
482211097802702850,Thu Jun 26 17:17:39 +0000 2014,@FDB_US great idea about sustaining relationship; how we figure out what's important to the customer vs. us is key. #HITMC
482210741970567200,Thu Jun 26 17:16:14 +0000 2014,After learning about how organizations are structured and decisions are made, problems, value &amp; issues in customer come to light #HITMC
482210416978710500,Thu Jun 26 17:14:57 +0000 2014,@ehrandhit agree with focus on value and need; way to do is to run org analysis of intended customers &amp; see how they're structured #HITMC
482209920927141900,Thu Jun 26 17:12:58 +0000 2014,@DICOMGrid @techguy "knowing your audience" in B2B starts with knowing their org role, their responsibilities, their budget allowance #HITMC
482209342666866700,Thu Jun 26 17:10:40 +0000 2014,I've been seeing a lot of talk these days about B2B products being great but not enough about how to operationalize in real world #HITMC
482209192242331650,Thu Jun 26 17:10:05 +0000 2014,T1: When discussing products, draw clear lines from real customer problems to your solutions including how to operationalize. #HITMC
482209085891571700,Thu Jun 26 17:09:39 +0000 2014,@DICOMGrid good point on tailoring. Perhaps focusing on jobs to be done by specific roles/specialties is a good way? #HITMC
482209006698893300,Thu Jun 26 17:09:20 +0000 2014,@DICOMGrid good point on tailoring. Perhaps focusing on jobs to be done by specific roles/specialties is a good way?
482208759092375550,Thu Jun 26 17:08:21 +0000 2014,@jslentzclifton exactly right, trending is key. But tying trends to specific uses that customers care about is even more important. #HITMC
482208471384080400,Thu Jun 26 17:07:13 +0000 2014,When selling socially, don’t try to broadcast messages applicable nationally – focus locally on what matters to specific audiences. #HITMC
482208371362504700,Thu Jun 26 17:06:49 +0000 2014,@mpanner right on. if we redefine selling to focusing on value, social is the perfect way to go. #HITMC
482208123391066100,Thu Jun 26 17:05:50 +0000 2014,When selling socially, audience development is key; use local topics/trends to draw community attention before discussing solutions. #HITMC
482208014561452000,Thu Jun 26 17:05:24 +0000 2014,Most healthcare sales are "local" and selling is inherently social; using social to identify trends and implications is great start. #HITMC
482207928838266900,Thu Jun 26 17:05:03 +0000 2014,Let's kick off topic 1: How can healthcare B2B marketers use social selling to their advantage? #HITMC
