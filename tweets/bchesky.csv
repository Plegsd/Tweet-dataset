814956777502609400,Fri Dec 30 22:10:11 +0000 2016,And lots of basics: better filters, discovery, natural language search.

813448274233397200,Mon Dec 26 18:15:56 +0000 2016,@typesfast here is the SF registration system. Good luck. https://t.co/ovVyIvqWHy
813447822661980200,Mon Dec 26 18:14:08 +0000 2016,@typesfast I believe so... as long as you register your tent with the city. I had to register my couch.
813447681146163200,Mon Dec 26 18:13:34 +0000 2016,@ashwindeshmukh we did his in Havana, Cuba
813447533460619300,Mon Dec 26 18:12:59 +0000 2016,@ZacharyWallman you have to be passionate otherwise you'd quit. No rational person would keep doing it if they didn't love it
813447426686275600,Mon Dec 26 18:12:34 +0000 2016,@ZacharyWallman yes
813447343613743100,Mon Dec 26 18:12:14 +0000 2016,@herbigt the reason tools are so bad is they have to connect to a 1970s GDS software system (Amadeus, Galileo). This can be circumvented
813446627885203500,Mon Dec 26 18:09:23 +0000 2016,@fjabrego alrighty
813446517306642400,Mon Dec 26 18:08:57 +0000 2016,@ZacharyWallman a little
813446478404390900,Mon Dec 26 18:08:48 +0000 2016,@arikroc our satisfaction scores are much higher than hotel industry - hence growth rate
813446383810310100,Mon Dec 26 18:08:25 +0000 2016,@arikroc what if I could show you statically speaking its more consistent than a hotel
813446221016731600,Mon Dec 26 18:07:46 +0000 2016,@arikroc yes totally human :)
813446153563947000,Mon Dec 26 18:07:30 +0000 2016,@ben_derv @runutkurun everywhere. And treehouse are most profitable property per square foot
813445813833764900,Mon Dec 26 18:06:09 +0000 2016,@TheBSTravelers did you write about it in the review?
813445628567154700,Mon Dec 26 18:05:25 +0000 2016,@mlevchin @Airbnb @Affirm I owe you a follow up from our convo ;)
813445334873636900,Mon Dec 26 18:04:15 +0000 2016,@BeingKimmieToo @Airbnb how can we be better?
813445199934423000,Mon Dec 26 18:03:43 +0000 2016,@hhpapazian I'm passionate about this idea. Makes world more efficient and caring. No new infrastructure necessary

813444190625558500,Mon Dec 26 17:59:42 +0000 2016,@kepano can you give examples of mood?
813444081888219100,Mon Dec 26 17:59:16 +0000 2016,@danderoz ;) would you definitely use such a service?
813443960412708900,Mon Dec 26 17:58:47 +0000 2016,@BeingKimmieToo here is just one article about some of the steps we have taken: https://t.co/fRql9aOcbk
813443683387375600,Mon Dec 26 17:57:41 +0000 2016,@BeingKimmieToo we've written a lot about this and I emailed entire community. Did you see this?
813443446333644800,Mon Dec 26 17:56:45 +0000 2016,@TheBSTravelers how many trips have you taken?
813443393695129600,Mon Dec 26 17:56:32 +0000 2016,@arikroc we usually have equivalent prices places and we sometimes reserve inventory for this scenario
813443206566342700,Mon Dec 26 17:55:48 +0000 2016,@arikroc you'd be surprised how often it works though :)
813442957022003200,Mon Dec 26 17:54:48 +0000 2016,@dsaezgil more details?
813442867456802800,Mon Dec 26 17:54:27 +0000 2016,@GavSays yes what they do is sell stuff others make (no risk to them) then decide based on data (and margin) what to make themselves
813442664687407100,Mon Dec 26 17:53:38 +0000 2016,@ispekhov @Airbnb @elonmusk :)
813442616113164300,Mon Dec 26 17:53:27 +0000 2016,@NISHANTVATSAL @jzaslav the issue with most of these companies is they don't have enough demand, seats don't get filled, meals cancelled
813442175895797800,Mon Dec 26 17:51:42 +0000 2016,@amix3k a lot of people have requested this
813441715621204000,Mon Dec 26 17:49:52 +0000 2016,@shawnnderson @tilt @jjbeshara ask and you shall...
813441660340281300,Mon Dec 26 17:49:39 +0000 2016,@shawnnderson @tilt @jjbeshara we love Tilt!
813441549761650700,Mon Dec 26 17:49:13 +0000 2016,@Mistermills how could I do that
813441449685581800,Mon Dec 26 17:48:49 +0000 2016,@BSG617 happy to. If I'm funny, it's not on purpose :)
813441255124377600,Mon Dec 26 17:48:02 +0000 2016,@dqueezy great idea. We have a lot in store for group travel in 2017.
813441116674605000,Mon Dec 26 17:47:29 +0000 2016,@jacilynh awesome
813441073532072000,Mon Dec 26 17:47:19 +0000 2016,@arikroc got it. Our homes aren't standardized commodities, so if we found a nicer home would you pay the difference?
813440870699700200,Mon Dec 26 17:46:31 +0000 2016,@ataussig thanks Alex
813440657184477200,Mon Dec 26 17:45:40 +0000 2016,@TsonicTsunami @sthenc @mikehogan_ @Airbnb we don't have control over charge backs

813440465924198400,Mon Dec 26 17:44:54 +0000 2016,@typesfast @moaazsidat cities want to hear from their constituents directly
813440344671092700,Mon Dec 26 17:44:25 +0000 2016,@typesfast building products is much easier ;)
813440232800522200,Mon Dec 26 17:43:59 +0000 2016,@GavSays when you make something it's first party. You are correct Amazon cherry picked verticals ans made their own stuff. Good idea
813440035529883600,Mon Dec 26 17:43:12 +0000 2016,@ChetMandair great idea
813439976507641900,Mon Dec 26 17:42:58 +0000 2016,@KaysarRidha tech is catching up fast, system and UI needs to be simpler
813439881506652200,Mon Dec 26 17:42:35 +0000 2016,@KaysarRidha agree eventually homes should be networked and intelligent. This will happen, matter of time.
813439718767661000,Mon Dec 26 17:41:56 +0000 2016,@Plateau_Tours we will do some things like this. Do you have specific asks in mind
813439261970202600,Mon Dec 26 17:40:07 +0000 2016,@korirotti yes this would be broad search
813439184815947800,Mon Dec 26 17:39:49 +0000 2016,@jacilynh which in particular would you be excited about
813439071380967400,Mon Dec 26 17:39:22 +0000 2016,@amitsiwal just try out the new mobile app
813439012434223100,Mon Dec 26 17:39:08 +0000 2016,@korirotti this is coming in the spring
813438958373916700,Mon Dec 26 17:38:55 +0000 2016,@hhpapazian love this, but people have to willing to let people into their home
813437483224596500,Mon Dec 26 17:33:03 +0000 2016,@danprimack @ataussig technically, no :)

813436318562811900,Mon Dec 26 17:28:25 +0000 2016,@SteffenKrogmann how bout just making comparison shopping in app easier? This is an ultra niche power tool
813436180939284500,Mon Dec 26 17:27:53 +0000 2016,@hhpapazian would love ideas
813436111649472500,Mon Dec 26 17:27:36 +0000 2016,@parkeragee we are actively considering this, agree it's big

813435740059222000,Mon Dec 26 17:26:07 +0000 2016,@yishusee you mean small local businesses offering experiences? Also, have you seen our new experiences product?
813435560614395900,Mon Dec 26 17:25:25 +0000 2016,@cebrianmonereo as opposed to the Airbnb's there?
813435486152884200,Mon Dec 26 17:25:07 +0000 2016,@vhuguet really cool idea!
813435435313729500,Mon Dec 26 17:24:55 +0000 2016,@waqaspai @ShaneMac @Airbnb this is a polialr request and it's a more disruptive entry point into aviation than selling commercial flights
813434356186357800,Mon Dec 26 17:20:38 +0000 2016,@runutkurun got it. Tents and teepees being rented on Airbnb (even in people's backyards) has been surprisingly popular.
813434200439328800,Mon Dec 26 17:20:00 +0000 2016,@amitsiwal we are doing more here
