840620685852594200,Sat Mar 11 17:49:24 +0000 2017,Soloway is discussing "essentialism." Binary constructs are a real problem, she says.
840618963360972800,Sat Mar 11 17:42:33 +0000 2017,Lines from Soloway's "thought experiment" for me to remember: The presidents have always been you. You know what else is for you? Sundays.
840618198139560000,Sat Mar 11 17:39:31 +0000 2017,Being "down one" or more can make you that many steps removed from being in touch with your instincts, Jill Soloway said.
840618067507990500,Sat Mar 11 17:38:59 +0000 2017,Soloway is talking about the concept of "down one" -- woman, person of color, person with disability. You can be down many more than one.

840617050523521000,Sat Mar 11 17:34:57 +0000 2017,Soloway says "Transparent" is directed according to the actors' bodies instead of traditional tools.

840611096792838100,Sat Mar 11 17:11:17 +0000 2017,‚ÄúThere‚Äôs noting more connected to directing than desire.‚Äù And in our culture, for women, desire is shamed, Soloway says.

840610536056320000,Sat Mar 11 17:09:04 +0000 2017,But, Soloway says, some of the reasons there aren‚Äôt more women directors are personal and psychological.
840610452434489300,Sat Mar 11 17:08:44 +0000 2017,So many reasons, Soloway says: Cultural and social ‚Äî patriarchy, men, white men, ‚Äúopportunity hoarding.‚Äù
