613119891617361900,Mon Jun 22 23:02:28 +0000 2015,.@IMDb @AphonicBooks I just wrapped up two James Franco projects that Im excited about and then Im developing some stuff behinf the camera
613119281534890000,Mon Jun 22 23:00:02 +0000 2015,.@IMDb @ehovs2 Ive always been drawn to dark character driven dramas and thrillers... so probably something psychological and dark
613118935811010600,Mon Jun 22 22:58:40 +0000 2015,.@IMDb @SwieSelina i can play a little guitar... and I really love creating stories.

613115944152371200,Mon Jun 22 22:46:46 +0000 2015,.@IMDb @kellywithayy not very much because Nick didn't know who Pablo was. If i did then it'd require more willing suspense of disbelief.
