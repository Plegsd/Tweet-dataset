610120359820591100,Sun Jun 14 16:23:23 +0000 2015,@LeighannLord Hey, syzygy is one of my words!  FYI: In script, all but the first letter (five in a row) dip below the line.
610107635866693600,Sun Jun 14 15:32:50 +0000 2015,@Lee7828: Universe begins with a vowel, but we say “A” not “An" Universe. U is pronounced “You” which begins with a consonant
610099796133720000,Sun Jun 14 15:01:41 +0000 2015,@Lee7828  Just an FYI:  When written as an abbreviation, the “F” in “FYI" is pronounced “ef”, which has a leading vowel. Hence the “an”.

607228029157269500,Sat Jun 06 16:50:18 +0000 2015,Cool Fact: Helium was discovered on the Sun before it was discovered on Earth. Was thus named for Helios, the Greek Sun god.
607227570552107000,Sat Jun 06 16:48:29 +0000 2015,Or maybe Cherubs are actually filled with Helium. But Helium wasn’t discovered until 1868, long after most Cherubs were drawn

606638326259556400,Fri Jun 05 01:47:02 +0000 2015,In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area.

606636592720171000,Fri Jun 05 01:40:09 +0000 2015,A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie.
606635536690880500,Fri Jun 05 01:35:57 +0000 2015,Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings.

605924422982070300,Wed Jun 03 02:30:14 +0000 2015,Last one: The Latinized name for Earth is Terra. If you are human "of the Earth" you are Terrable. (Just kidding, Earthlings)
605923295007932400,Wed Jun 03 02:25:45 +0000 2015,Want More? The Moon's Latinized name is Luna.  If you are "of the Moon” youre simply “Lunar”.  Lunatics are something else..
605922725421449200,Wed Jun 03 02:23:29 +0000 2015,Not that anybody asked, but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are "of the Sun" you are simply “Solar”.
