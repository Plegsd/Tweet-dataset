794147516916830200,Thu Nov 03 12:01:37 +0000 2016,Every kahaani is ultimately common but it's what u bring with your approach that makes it fresh. If you're convinced ,go ahead &amp; make it.

794146320969855000,Thu Nov 03 11:56:52 +0000 2016,An actor should not be too self aware of being an actor. The way people talk to u &amp; greet u &amp; approach u should tell u that u have arrived.
794146095106551800,Thu Nov 03 11:55:58 +0000 2016,Actors shouldn't do too much homework or immerse themselves so much that they have to go to a psychiatrist. Acting like acting mat karo.
794145875824181200,Thu Nov 03 11:55:05 +0000 2016,#SRK is one of the finest actors in India but he doesn't take himself 2 seriously or prepare too much. He's flexible &amp; adds his own touch.

794143081788538900,Thu Nov 03 11:43:59 +0000 2016,I can't cast new actors in #Golmaal. The audience will not take it. If I feel that a film needs newcomers I will work w/ them #rohitshetty
794142827689209900,Thu Nov 03 11:42:59 +0000 2016,#rohitshetty  The type of humour in #Singham &amp; #Golmaal is very different &amp; ditto for the action. A balance has to be maintained. #iftda

794140442556297200,Thu Nov 03 11:33:30 +0000 2016,The Army Men are Real Heroes; we &amp; cinema heroes are not. That's why there's a difference between actual Army &amp; portrayal of #Army in movies
794139955224281100,Thu Nov 03 11:31:34 +0000 2016,I think directors &amp; audiences get excited about a short film but what's the actual reach ? The same story cud hv reached crores of people.
794139255983448000,Thu Nov 03 11:28:47 +0000 2016,I didn't shoot on the Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link in Mumbai. I can't blow it up. It was CGI . I learnt the ropes. #behindthescenes  #rohitshetty

794138149329010700,Thu Nov 03 11:24:23 +0000 2016,It's shameful that in a population of 120 crore, only 10 crore people go to watch a movie. We need more cinemas across the country.
794137951085232100,Thu Nov 03 11:23:36 +0000 2016,Director has nothing to do with the marketing budget but all the pressure is on him. That's why a beautiful small film can't do well.
794137742913470500,Thu Nov 03 11:22:46 +0000 2016,People have been saying that the world, films , industry , etc is going to end it shut down but that's never going to happen.  #rohitshetty
794137564194242600,Thu Nov 03 11:22:04 +0000 2016,The society is changing today. People are taking up more jobs. English speaking boys work in Coffee shops. People are more broad minded.
794137283880288300,Thu Nov 03 11:20:57 +0000 2016,I feel that parallel cinema and commercial cinema have always co-existed. It's just that today we use terms like multiplex films &amp; such.
794137034260672500,Thu Nov 03 11:19:57 +0000 2016,I don't think young social media journalists know of or have seen movies from the past like ArdhSatya, Dharavi, Do Bhiga Zameen, etc

794135873105395700,Thu Nov 03 11:15:21 +0000 2016,Sound &amp; ambience play in an important role. Background score is important in your narrative. Amar Mohile does my score. #rohitshetty

794134279286640600,Thu Nov 03 11:09:01 +0000 2016,I'm trained in action. I became a film director by accident. I've my own action team &amp; equipment. I release my frustration in action scenes
794133989393043500,Thu Nov 03 11:07:52 +0000 2016,You tend to shoot more. I do that in action &amp; dramatic scenes. I am old school. I don't do story boards. I've done 400 shots from my head.
794133596407820300,Thu Nov 03 11:06:18 +0000 2016,Be harsh with your film while editing. Be a strict parent with your baby in the editing room because it's for the betterment of the movie.
794133400806457300,Thu Nov 03 11:05:31 +0000 2016,I believe a film is made in office ..from writing to editing. Shooting is not the most important. Camera angles differ between directors
794133133243416600,Thu Nov 03 11:04:27 +0000 2016,I feel my films are fast &amp; songs slow it down. Comedy is important.  Singh am cannot have 6- 8 songs. It should come naturally #RohitShetty
794132912597766100,Thu Nov 03 11:03:35 +0000 2016,Every writer writes a film thinking &amp; hoping they'll get #AamirKhan , #SRK or #SalmanKhan  But u can't predict your lead pair! #RohitShetty

794130404399870000,Thu Nov 03 10:53:37 +0000 2016,Kahaani, screenplay, dialogues are most important. After that we work on technical aspects &amp; costumes, etc #RohitShetty  #IFTDAMasterclass
794130064287866900,Thu Nov 03 10:52:16 +0000 2016,#Singham is considered an action film because of the inherent anger of the character.  #RohitShetty  #IFTDAMasterclass  #AjayDevgn
