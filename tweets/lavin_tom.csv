641422537239433200,Wed Sep 09 01:27:04 +0000 2015,@megynkelly Fast forwarding thru Fowler. He’s not a zero but a negative. Useless blather and talks over people.
639269260926300200,Thu Sep 03 02:50:43 +0000 2015,@megynkelly #kellyfile missed a big point last night. Sanctuary cities can give NOTICE to ICE w/o warrant. Easy pressure point to apply.
639268514164015100,Thu Sep 03 02:47:45 +0000 2015,@megynkelly #KellyFile Fowler again? B on B crime is guns’ fault not black. Useless. No valuable content. Interrupts every single time.
638897585403600900,Wed Sep 02 02:13:49 +0000 2015,@megynkelly @KatiePavlich why is Fowler on the show? Talks over people all the time w blather.

636736572591853600,Thu Aug 27 03:06:43 +0000 2015,@megynkelly @jorgeramosnews @realDonaldTrump Ramos tried to hijack, not ask a question. Not a debate w him. Ramos was dead wrong.
636365631038836700,Wed Aug 26 02:32:44 +0000 2015,@Lynnp27 @megynkelly and he interrupted Col. West who had something to say. Please replace Fowler. I would prefer Zimmerman, god help me.
636359547947483100,Wed Aug 26 02:08:33 +0000 2015,@megynkelly lose Fowler. He smugly spouts uninteresting nonsense. He adds nothing! Lose him. #kellyfile

636326847295397900,Tue Aug 25 23:58:37 +0000 2015,@NickKristof Ramos unilaterally decided it was a debate between him and DT and not a presser. Totally wrong- both of you. Wise up.

626575870271074300,Thu Jul 30 02:11:43 +0000 2015,@megynkelly @AnnCoulter Priority is supposedly deporting criminal illegals unless they are ensconced in sanctuary cities. Then not so much.

623312597975179300,Tue Jul 21 02:04:38 +0000 2015,@megynkelly please don’t feature Meghan McCain. She is a nice young woman but has few accomplishments beyond her name. Not interesting.

621870605021880300,Fri Jul 17 02:34:40 +0000 2015,@megynkelly "workplace violence" or terrorism? Let see how Obama and Loretta Lynch call this one. Remember Ft. Hood.

621669094333526000,Thu Jul 16 13:13:56 +0000 2015,@megynkelly outrageous NYT article on S Walker case. No mention of legality of draconian secrecy requirements or Gestapo tactics. Pls cover.
621515070296719400,Thu Jul 16 03:01:54 +0000 2015,@megynkelly #kellyfile you need new lefties. Zimmerman filibustered and obfuscated tonight, Fuentes last night and Fowler before that.
619686465509949400,Sat Jul 11 01:55:41 +0000 2015,@megynkelly please replace fowler asap. Grinning smart ass who distracts from the discussion. So bad I now prefer Zimmerman, God help me
619319098804183000,Fri Jul 10 01:35:54 +0000 2015,Lose Richard. He contributes nothing. Just filibusters on tangents. You managed his nonsense quite well. #KellyFile
