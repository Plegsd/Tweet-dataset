1005530141659824100,Sat Jun 09 19:20:42 +0000 2018,I guess we got Respawn’s new Star Wars game, though that was super low key
1005529946242990100,Sat Jun 09 19:19:55 +0000 2018,so far the show is all things we’ve known about aside from the indie game reveals and mobile cnc. No final surprise for the show? New game?
1005528757803683800,Sat Jun 09 19:15:12 +0000 2018,for a game that’s supposed to bring Bioware story telling, the setup we’ve gotten sure is bland
1005528077353476100,Sat Jun 09 19:12:30 +0000 2018,also, wth does “pay to win” even mean for a game that as far as we know is entirely PVE/Co-op
1005527681306251300,Sat Jun 09 19:10:55 +0000 2018,ok, it’s dumb, but i kinda liked the Mass Effect/Dragon Age paint jobs they snuck in there
1005526947546292200,Sat Jun 09 19:08:00 +0000 2018,this in depth talk about the game sure is vague
1005526402840473600,Sat Jun 09 19:05:50 +0000 2018,The Destiny vibes are gettin pretty strong
1005524749219319800,Sat Jun 09 18:59:16 +0000 2018,OK ANTHEM, let’s see how you’re shaping up
1005524106136117200,Sat Jun 09 18:56:43 +0000 2018,wow that could not have ended soon enough
1005520424392769500,Sat Jun 09 18:42:05 +0000 2018,and now that we got two interesting artsy trailers back to back, BACK TO SPORTS
1005517188294250500,Sat Jun 09 18:29:13 +0000 2018,while not a huge surprise given news this morning, happy to see Unravel make an appearance. We need more variety like this at EA’s show
1005515207441936400,Sat Jun 09 18:21:21 +0000 2018,so far my joke prediction is…disturbingly on track
1005512151186878500,Sat Jun 09 18:09:13 +0000 2018,gotta love when press conferences tease other press conferences
1005509958673154000,Sat Jun 09 18:00:30 +0000 2018,oh oh, also my obligatory lost hope that EA will bring back SSX a la the style of tricky
1005505199132164100,Sat Jun 09 17:41:35 +0000 2018,prediction: Sports game, sports game, Anthem, Sports game, Mobile game with microtransactions, awkward guest appearance, Something Star Wars
1005504798626467800,Sat Jun 09 17:40:00 +0000 2018,ALRIGHT, get ready for a lot of tweets that are gonna make no sense if you aren’t watching EA’s press conference in 20

874731197972193300,Tue Jun 13 20:52:23 +0000 2017,it’s really insane how packed it is this year, almost feels like just sitting back and watching live streams is more productive
874723909299392500,Tue Jun 13 20:23:26 +0000 2017,I love the random things you can overhear on the E3 showfloor "WHERE ARE THE LESBIANS? WE NEED MORE LESBIANS"
874698749221535700,Tue Jun 13 18:43:27 +0000 2017,Just pulled up to E3 and holy crap this thing is clearly more packed than ever before

874672765164429300,Tue Jun 13 17:00:12 +0000 2017,I hate that I told myself I’d limit my amiibo buying to just a few franchises….and Zelda was one of them. I ONLY HAVE SO MANY SHELVES
874671750277079000,Tue Jun 13 16:56:10 +0000 2017,Mario Odyssey better end on the cliche scene of peach and bowser about to say vows as Mario busts through the chapel doors yelling I OBJECT

874665674978713600,Tue Jun 13 16:32:02 +0000 2017,Overall Nintendo’s show was short but pretty sweet, debating between which i’m more hyped about, them or Ubisoft’s conference
874663743149400000,Tue Jun 13 16:24:21 +0000 2017,Did…did mario just possess a frog and goomba? is…is he a demon?

873645838609694700,Sat Jun 10 20:59:34 +0000 2017,Also a little sad we didn’t get news on a new Dragon Age. I’ve had my problems with the series, but there’s something comfy about them to me
873636704678142000,Sat Jun 10 20:23:16 +0000 2017,Kinda wish we got some kind of nod to the Switch, Nintendo needs to see some of that third party love right now. Comes down to Ubisoft now
873636297612513300,Sat Jun 10 20:21:39 +0000 2017,I’m just glad we didn’t get any Minion/mobile game stuff pushed hard, outside of that little side mention of Star Wars Galaxy at the end
873636146147762200,Sat Jun 10 20:21:03 +0000 2017,all in all this was ok for EA, big highlight was definitely A Way Out, SWBFII looks like an improvement, need more Bioware info
873635824394321900,Sat Jun 10 20:19:46 +0000 2017,wow. I mean, all the SWBFII gameplay looked great but…that was a really anti climactic finish

819787033149194200,Fri Jan 13 06:03:54 +0000 2017,@JTMtwentyfour yeah, it’s odd how many trailers came out after the event that weren’t in the show aside from that quick highlight reel
819778169783795700,Fri Jan 13 05:28:41 +0000 2017,@AeroBlades_ For games like Skyrim I think leaving is likely, but sports games might find an interesting home on it thanks to portable MP
819774576074768400,Fri Jan 13 05:14:24 +0000 2017,@AeroBlades_ eh, i think that was mostly just a taste. plus lots of other third party support they showed was from Japan like SE and Atlus
819773321642262500,Fri Jan 13 05:09:25 +0000 2017,@AeroBlades_ tbh I loved just about every game announcement past the first two and Fifa, so I’m hyped, but for most people we need more &gt;&lt;

796746731866046500,Thu Nov 10 16:09:58 +0000 2016,@Lee_York It does upscale non patched games to 4k, but for checkerboard upscaling and actually improved visuals, a patch is needed
796609750351814700,Thu Nov 10 07:05:39 +0000 2016,@Lee_York As far as I can tell right now patching is required. Playing games without a pro patch forces the Pro to act like a regular PS4

796497591038976000,Wed Nov 09 23:39:58 +0000 2016,@perdomocarlos_ If you don’t care hard about graphics, I like Xbox One a bit more for an all in one device. 4k blu ray support doesn’t hurt
796492485920817200,Wed Nov 09 23:19:41 +0000 2016,@perdomocarlos_  What kind of games do you generally prefer playing? Want something purely for gaming or do you want multimedia too?
796458526860152800,Wed Nov 09 21:04:44 +0000 2016,Prepping for the PS4 Pro launch tonight, get them questions in!!!
796415675208040400,Wed Nov 09 18:14:28 +0000 2016,@KennyThePoetic Not sure if different is even the right answer, the big problem is just over saturation. But hey, it keeps making its money
796414112863436800,Wed Nov 09 18:08:15 +0000 2016,@KennyThePoetic All in all it’s still COD, not bad but a bit too much of more of the same for my taste. Overall I’m digging TF2 more
796413931946262500,Wed Nov 09 18:07:32 +0000 2016,@KennyThePoetic Still working on that one, current thoughts though are the Campaign is ok, zombies is zombies (fun), and MP is BO3 repainted

789140676801761300,Thu Oct 20 16:26:13 +0000 2016,@rainskull1 Very, though hopefully this will actually support 1080p on your TV, and it has the bonus of being an all in one device
789140376527343600,Thu Oct 20 16:25:01 +0000 2016,@AeroBlades_ I’m always on edge with that though because the same happened with the Wii U. Remember ME3, AC4, and Deus ex ports?
789140120234397700,Thu Oct 20 16:24:00 +0000 2016,@rainskull1 Oh it’s most definitely a gimmick, but that isn’t a bad thing at its core. I find it less odd than what they did with the wii/u
789138490885673000,Thu Oct 20 16:17:32 +0000 2016,What are people’s hype meters at for the #Nintendoswitch after that trailer? Personally I’m excited but curious where others are at
789117180323389400,Thu Oct 20 14:52:51 +0000 2016,@Kingifford if the early patents and rumors are true it should, the portable screen should be 720 while at home will do 1080
789109150487752700,Thu Oct 20 14:20:57 +0000 2016,@Kingifford Oh yeah, I really like the overall idea, just not a fan of that stock square controller, looks uncomfortable
789107098667720700,Thu Oct 20 14:12:47 +0000 2016,glad they showed a bunch of supposed port games ready for soon after launch, now let’s just hope we have some good new original titles too
789106833034055700,Thu Oct 20 14:11:44 +0000 2016,Gut Reaction to #NintendoSwitch trailer: I like it, the stock controller looks super uncomfortable tho. Thank god it showed a pro controller

742420458604138500,Mon Jun 13 18:16:45 +0000 2016,highlights for me gaming-wise was definitely  Scalebound, Dead Rising 4, and Recore. We Happy Few looks interesting too #E32016

735180658977341400,Tue May 24 18:48:22 +0000 2016,@Luis_GVN i think Soldier was first meant to be the posterboy, he's noob friendly, is the former commander, and was a pet creation of Metzen

730142729007566800,Tue May 10 21:09:26 +0000 2016,@ChristineAnloff Considering all the single packs are already being sold at almost half off at bestbuy, toys r' us, and amazon...

727281569677758500,Mon May 02 23:40:13 +0000 2016,@MelloMakes That's fair, dashing and wall jumps are super important and add a lot more complexity to the game's movement.

727277557842776000,Mon May 02 23:24:16 +0000 2016,@MelloMakes Basically, X was so awesome it ruined a lot of other Mega Man games for people, including X2 and X3 which weren't as good
727277354347700200,Mon May 02 23:23:28 +0000 2016,@MelloMakes I loved that one too because of how many collectables it had, but it is overlooked a lot. Mainly because it's not X I think
727275671530016800,Mon May 02 23:16:46 +0000 2016,@MelloMakes That and probably a bit of atrophy from similar game back to back to back, thus why X revived things when it launched in 93/94

718141500656255000,Thu Apr 07 18:20:50 +0000 2016,Writing out all my thoughts on @quantumbreak, already have all my gameplay captured so video will be up late tonight, maybe tomorrow morning
718134501847617500,Thu Apr 07 17:53:02 +0000 2016,Plot heavy with gameplay somewhat secondary, but still fun, offers some replayability, and actually resolves it's core plot
718134267285413900,Thu Apr 07 17:52:06 +0000 2016,Having finished Quantum Break, it feels like it has a lot of crossover with what Order 1886 was trying to do. Just actually executed well
718133155278884900,Thu Apr 07 17:47:41 +0000 2016,@Luis_GVN Honestly after playing through this feels like the same general design idea of Order 1886, but executed waaaaay better
718133010831290400,Thu Apr 07 17:47:06 +0000 2016,@Luis_GVN It was a solid post credit scene, resolved most of the story while leaving room for future plot. Wasn't super cliffhangery

652648684245512200,Sat Oct 10 00:55:46 +0000 2015,Thinking of streaming regularly this month, maybe something horror themed. Any requests or suggestions? In the mood for something classic

610874825394024400,Tue Jun 16 18:21:22 +0000 2015,RT @ProJared: And they close out with a reworked Terra's theme from FF VI? How dare you. HOW DARE YOU.
610870440643399700,Tue Jun 16 18:03:57 +0000 2015,YESSSS new Star Ocean gameplay...and yet this show is still boring as soon as we get back to people talking &gt;_&gt;
610859728453902300,Tue Jun 16 17:21:23 +0000 2015,This conference is so weird feeling...the games seem like good news but the presentation is just so awful
610852602222227500,Tue Jun 16 16:53:04 +0000 2015,That....was a strangely very weak finish from Nintendo. Not a bad conference overall, plenty of games shown...just...no OHSHIT moment
610846530774265900,Tue Jun 16 16:28:56 +0000 2015,Seriously, how does full scale war combined with games about fighting demons turn into fantasy pop idols?
610846372846133200,Tue Jun 16 16:28:18 +0000 2015,In all the ways Fire Emblem and SMT could've been crossed over...this did not even occur to me.
610634727138050000,Tue Jun 16 02:27:18 +0000 2015,I bet Sony’s intentionally having technical difficulties to prove the hype of their announcements counters ANYTHING
610632738824065000,Tue Jun 16 02:19:24 +0000 2015,The question in my head right now is after all these ridiculous announcements…what are they gonna try to finish on?

610564073005015000,Mon Jun 15 21:46:33 +0000 2015,Current ranking I'm giving conferences so far: 1st Bethesda, 2nd Microsoft, 3rd EA. Let's see where Ubisoft lands!
610558715993796600,Mon Jun 15 21:25:16 +0000 2015,Not gonna lie: the image of Luke wearing black using a green lightsaber during the battle of Hoth irked me
610558147132960800,Mon Jun 15 21:23:00 +0000 2015,While I'm still not happy with the rest of the show...as I watch Star Wars Battlefront I can only think: That'll do EA. That'll do
610556080934916100,Mon Jun 15 21:14:47 +0000 2015,Well, I'm just gonna look at it this way. EA's just setting the bar super high for worst press conference. Battlefront's their only hope
610554877563895800,Mon Jun 15 21:10:01 +0000 2015,The tiny amount of time that has been spent on Mass Effect and Mirror's Edge compared to everything else is nothing short of appalling #EAE3

610553048641900500,Mon Jun 15 21:02:44 +0000 2015,@JimSterling True, but how much of the Fifa audience is actively watching E3?
610552733808996400,Mon Jun 15 21:01:29 +0000 2015,@fullOanime PvZ is fine, but they've spent over half the show emphasizing a hand full of sports games and a mobile microtransaction utopia
610552050967953400,Mon Jun 15 20:58:47 +0000 2015,EA continues to pull the same crap they do every year, focusing on guests and games that none of the actual E3 watching audience cares about
610551680040439800,Mon Jun 15 20:57:18 +0000 2015,I seriously haven't cared for anything that has been said in the last 30 minutes of this conference #EAE3
610539908768215000,Mon Jun 15 20:10:32 +0000 2015,Man, no other gaming company has quite mastered the art of buzzword speak like EA
610538188415696900,Mon Jun 15 20:03:42 +0000 2015,Well, that certainly was a smarter way to start the conference instead of doing a montage, Mass Effect 4!!!! #EAE3
610536686435438600,Mon Jun 15 19:57:43 +0000 2015,Everyone excited to watch some more 100% live multiplayer demos with completely real in game chat? #E32015

610527585039061000,Mon Jun 15 19:21:33 +0000 2015,@WreckItAlex yep!
610510206775103500,Mon Jun 15 18:12:30 +0000 2015,@Gbarielmoreno Yeah, I had a good chuckle at that...I just wish that companies that have their own show would stick to just that
610510020761915400,Mon Jun 15 18:11:46 +0000 2015,@ProJared Yeah, I felt the same...not their worst but nothing really jumped out at me other than backwards compatibility and the hololens
610508706577428500,Mon Jun 15 18:06:33 +0000 2015,Not a bad Microsoft conference, weaker than last year but some solid stuff, backwards compatibility and hololens were definitely the peaks
610496901566214100,Mon Jun 15 17:19:38 +0000 2015,@SrgntBallistic Yeah, I get that it's been happening and I can see why, but it ultimately feels like a losing move to me, so much filler
610495720366325800,Mon Jun 15 17:14:56 +0000 2015,This is a Microsoft Press Conference, lemme see more of these amazing exclusives that Phil Spencer is teased at the start
610495555848925200,Mon Jun 15 17:14:17 +0000 2015,Division is good and all, but I feel like we're seeing a bit too much crossover here of companies that have their own press conferences
610494673589661700,Mon Jun 15 17:10:47 +0000 2015,mmmmm dark souls, please just up the writing and world design compared to 2
610492221318561800,Mon Jun 15 17:01:02 +0000 2015,I love how much more noticeably quiet the audience is while EA's being featured talking about their subscription model
610490880319852500,Mon Jun 15 16:55:42 +0000 2015,OH NEVER MIND they changed now
610490698094153700,Mon Jun 15 16:54:59 +0000 2015,I'm super excited about Fallout 4 and all but...we saw all this gameplay yesterday :/
610488965297147900,Mon Jun 15 16:48:06 +0000 2015,BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY YESSSSSS...guess i don't need my 360 anymore
610480407331516400,Mon Jun 15 16:14:05 +0000 2015,@WreckItAlex Somewhat, currently planning to do one big roundup/highlights vid, but if some of the shows today are super dense I might do 2
610289453613998100,Mon Jun 15 03:35:19 +0000 2015,@stevemwiggins yes! Though this year I'm just planning on one big round up, unless the next few shows are super dense
610286609510993900,Mon Jun 15 03:24:00 +0000 2015,1 press conference down, 6 to go
610286160292646900,Mon Jun 15 03:22:13 +0000 2015,Crap and it comes out this November? No idea how I'm gonna juggle all the holiday release games with a title this massive distracting me &gt;.&gt;
610285648411426800,Mon Jun 15 03:20:11 +0000 2015,@ZaxperTech I mean...yes? It's Fallout, all about that single player exploration
610284838055051300,Mon Jun 15 03:16:58 +0000 2015,in depth weapon crafting, power armor crafting, and making your own settlement? welp...so long life when this comes out
610283712278728700,Mon Jun 15 03:12:30 +0000 2015,ngl, still not a fan of the change in dialogue system but....everything else here I can 100% get behind
610283200577835000,Mon Jun 15 03:10:28 +0000 2015,aaaaand it comes out tonight....guess I know what I'm doing until next press conference.
610282711907864600,Mon Jun 15 03:08:31 +0000 2015,Fallout Shelter: A spin off app that actually looks entertaining and thought out? I DON'T UNDERSTAND
610281924829929500,Mon Jun 15 03:05:24 +0000 2015,welp....there went my money
610281519056183300,Mon Jun 15 03:03:47 +0000 2015,LAYERED ARMOR YES
610281445626507300,Mon Jun 15 03:03:29 +0000 2015,huh i found this random contraption on a dead guy's arm...better wear it
610280152677814300,Mon Jun 15 02:58:21 +0000 2015,On the other hand, Super happy to see more color in the game, way more vibrant looking
610279656546132000,Mon Jun 15 02:56:23 +0000 2015,aaaaaand now they've officially confirmed my fear for the game's dialogue system. So long interesting detailed choices
610278585765490700,Mon Jun 15 02:52:07 +0000 2015,@tldtoday QUIET JON GET BACK TO SPORTS
610278246052048900,Mon Jun 15 02:50:46 +0000 2015,ALL THIS BUILD UP PLEASE JUST SHOW ME FALLOUT
610275481720520700,Mon Jun 15 02:39:47 +0000 2015,OK not gonna lie....Kind of hype for Dishonored 2...at least as much as a trailer alone can get me
610274812951294000,Mon Jun 15 02:37:08 +0000 2015,oooo Dishonored 2, please be more difficult, please be more difficult
610274222741389300,Mon Jun 15 02:34:47 +0000 2015,oh yayyyyy a new required platform for playing games, just what I always wanted!
610272385778913300,Mon Jun 15 02:27:29 +0000 2015,I don't know guys, Doom is looking really violent, why can't you just hug the demons and make them not angry?
610271789353078800,Mon Jun 15 02:25:07 +0000 2015,Easy fan made maps? Yes. just. Yes
610270993269915600,Mon Jun 15 02:21:57 +0000 2015,@itmeJP What're you talking about? Everyone knows demons are filled with fruit punch, zero gore what so ever
610270086474022900,Mon Jun 15 02:18:21 +0000 2015,If the job they did with Wolfenstein and this trailer are any indication, then Bethesda is truly reviving the old school shooter properly
610269507840413700,Mon Jun 15 02:16:03 +0000 2015,@JimSterling Right?!
610269106642645000,Mon Jun 15 02:14:27 +0000 2015,yessss, old school health rules
610268874060099600,Mon Jun 15 02:13:32 +0000 2015,DOOM, i better not see that health bar regenerate
610266821460033500,Mon Jun 15 02:05:23 +0000 2015,IT BEGINS
610265403885948900,Mon Jun 15 01:59:45 +0000 2015,Bethesda press conference time in just a couple min! Here's hoping Fallout 4 looks strong, and maybe a confirmation of Dishonored 2!
610259811574218800,Mon Jun 15 01:37:31 +0000 2015,@iTsMeHhHChRiS @tldtoday lol, he meant me for giving him a pepsi
610258215603798000,Mon Jun 15 01:31:11 +0000 2015,@tldtoday @iTsMeHhHChRiS and a pepsi
609921421540626400,Sun Jun 14 03:12:53 +0000 2015,Vid is up! E3's starting soon and these are 5 games I absolutely want to find out more about that we know of so far https://t.co/iVxj87RVVP
609911007834562600,Sun Jun 14 02:31:30 +0000 2015,New Video on the way in just a bit! Was supposed to be up earlier but after it was uploaded and ready to go I realized I pulled a dumb &gt;&lt;
608706756995207200,Wed Jun 10 18:46:14 +0000 2015,@Magor34 nope, racing games have never been my forte so I haven't been reviewing them, I'd just be ranting on things I have no clue about
608705276208762900,Wed Jun 10 18:40:21 +0000 2015,@Magor34 No problem! I almost forgot, Far Cry 4 is also an excellent choice, though another game I'd argue is better on PC given the option
608701137609326600,Wed Jun 10 18:23:54 +0000 2015,@The_Final_Storm We'll see! I'm excited for it but Witcher's gonna be pretty tough to topple for me
608700907086172200,Wed Jun 10 18:23:00 +0000 2015,@rish_rr7 Well at this point it's better to wait till after E3, there's gonna be a lot of announcements that just might shift opinions
608700715406602200,Wed Jun 10 18:22:14 +0000 2015,@Magor34 If you can grab friends to play with, Diablo III and Borderlands are also excellent choices, though they're also better on PC
608700394332536800,Wed Jun 10 18:20:57 +0000 2015,@Magor34 Oh jeez, lots depending on your taste. For me the three most worth noting are Last of us, Infamous, and Tomb Raider
608365114950090800,Tue Jun 09 20:08:40 +0000 2015,And of course, as is now customary for E3, rumors of Last Guardian getting confirmed are spreading again. The dream continues
608343929377964000,Tue Jun 09 18:44:29 +0000 2015,Not sure how I feel about Dark Souls 3 being a thing...I liked 2 but it feels like all the not sequel souls games were a clear step above
608321624014745600,Tue Jun 09 17:15:51 +0000 2015,@Luis_GVN Because if anything can reassure your fan base after a near historic level of failure, it's a Hashtag
608321271366086700,Tue Jun 09 17:14:27 +0000 2015,@JoshKenson Damnit Josh, KNOW WHAT RECENT AWFUL GAMES ARE
608320917790425100,Tue Jun 09 17:13:03 +0000 2015,SO MUCH NEWS TODAY, Avellone's leaving Obsidian, Xbox One's getting a 1 TB drive, and Sonic Boom is getting some kind of forsaken sequel
608320205387919400,Tue Jun 09 17:10:13 +0000 2015,@Manray300 @JoshKenson @superscientific pft, Josh just can't handle fun, he sees some dice on the table and just goes wide eyed in fear
608319623814123500,Tue Jun 09 17:07:55 +0000 2015,hooooly crap congrats to The Witcher 3 selling 4 mill in just 2 weeks, I can't think of another game this year that deserves it more
608045638157148200,Mon Jun 08 22:59:11 +0000 2015,Now that I'm all done playing The Witcher 3, bout time I gave you guys my final thoughts! https://t.co/KWcZ6l7R6G

606155320390348800,Wed Jun 03 17:47:44 +0000 2015,@NickBorschew yeah I know, a man can dream though can't he?
606121859252297700,Wed Jun 03 15:34:47 +0000 2015,Need all of the morally gray choices like in New Vegas
606121732710133800,Wed Jun 03 15:34:16 +0000 2015,Fallout 4's looking a lot more colorful than 3/NV...hopefully the tone of the plot is still tastefully dreary
606119535150645200,Wed Jun 03 15:25:32 +0000 2015,Wake up, first things first: Fallout 4 Trailer. If only every morning could start with this kind of hype
