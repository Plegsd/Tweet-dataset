871397507900813300,Sun Jun 04 16:05:30 +0000 2017,Finally: it is disingenuous, naive, and even dangerous not even to acknowledge this harsh digital dilemma facing liberal democracy today.
871396783196393500,Sun Jun 04 16:02:37 +0000 2017,5—If the UK continues trying to roll back core liberal values by messing with an open and secure internet, then the terrorists win.
871396605185970200,Sun Jun 04 16:01:55 +0000 2017,4—"Democratic governments," unlike autocracies, should be *against* more censorship and *in favor* of securing its citizens offline &amp; online
871396238284947500,Sun Jun 04 16:00:27 +0000 2017,3—Focus on "big companies" is misleading. A range of secure comms channels will remain available to militants no matter what big firms do.
871396115203199000,Sun Jun 04 15:59:58 +0000 2017,2c—Less online security, in this counterterrorism context, mainly means trying to limit the use of end-to-end encryption.
871395763015876600,Sun Jun 04 15:58:34 +0000 2017,2b—Reducing security is more problematic: we can’t unprotect terrorist online while keeping our children and businesses protected.
871395600868286500,Sun Jun 04 15:57:55 +0000 2017,2a—Some forms of censorship of extremist, violent content are acceptable &amp; indeed desirable. More could be done—a tough, important debate.
871395317291397100,Sun Jun 04 15:56:48 +0000 2017,2—"Regulating cyberspace," in plain English, means two things: more censorship and less security (for everybody).
871395183199490000,Sun Jun 04 15:56:16 +0000 2017,1—Safe space trope is misguided. The internet is ubiquitous, like paper. Calling envelopes, letters &amp; pamphlets “paper space” makes no sense

805540700649562100,Sun Dec 04 22:34:03 +0000 2016,@annalist @h4uk3 Do you know if the file was moved—or re-uploaded after the Spiegel story? Note: the file's metadata are unique in dump

805534700731252700,Sun Dec 04 22:10:13 +0000 2016,One possible &amp; plausible explanation: Bundestag leak source has special access to Wikileaks, personal or technical.  Assange may be unaware.
805534278696259600,Sun Dec 04 22:08:32 +0000 2016,2—How did the leak's source then authenticate itself to Wikileaks so quickly to make the case that a file should be unpublished?
805534011787448300,Sun Dec 04 22:07:29 +0000 2016,1—How did the leak's source recognise the OPSEC error out so quickly, even before SPON story on 2 Dec 1408UTC? https://t.co/wRbzl6dVRJ
805533782019285000,Sun Dec 04 22:06:34 +0000 2016,Note: only the leak’s original source could have spotted OPSEC error after publication, not Wikileaks itself (if Spiegel coverage correct)
805533381245235200,Sun Dec 04 22:04:58 +0000 2016,.Wikileaks deleting the revealing file so quickly—even before Spiegel coverage mentions the OPSEC error—raises two curious questions.
