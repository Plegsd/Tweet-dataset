18382620574,Mon Jul 12 21:15:07 +0000 2010,I am confident I will continue to lead this team on and off the court.  Let the hunt for six begin...   Derek
18382596106,Mon Jul 12 21:14:41 +0000 2010,While this may not be the most lucrative contract I've been offered this off season, it is the most valuable.
18382570848,Mon Jul 12 21:14:13 +0000 2010,I have decided to continue with Kobe, continue with our teammates and the fans of Los Angeles.
18382553029,Mon Jul 12 21:13:53 +0000 2010,We have won five championships together.
18382536119,Mon Jul 12 21:13:34 +0000 2010,He & I have played together for 11 seasons, came into the league together as kids, & has been loyal to me even when others had doubts.
18382504324,Mon Jul 12 21:12:58 +0000 2010,At the end of the day, there's one person I could not turn away from.  Kobe Bryant asked me to stay but supported whatever decision I made.
18382487885,Mon Jul 12 21:12:39 +0000 2010,I listened to every coach, every general manager, even potential teammates in order to make the right decision & I thank every one of them.
18382454700,Mon Jul 12 21:12:02 +0000 2010,Numbers reported were guesses & true "sources" were few & far between.I took time to consider all my options, many not reported in the media
18382391124,Mon Jul 12 21:10:50 +0000 2010,and determine what new goals I want to achieve in the future.  Many reports were completely false.
18382332574,Mon Jul 12 21:09:45 +0000 2010,My free agency was a time for me to reevaluate my position in the league, reflect on my accomplishments individually and as a teammate,
