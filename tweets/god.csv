1085579599,Tue Dec 30 08:27:08 +0000 2008,@rdweatherly well, when you are as amorphous and ineffable as I am, all sorts decide to be your mouthpiece.

1076727837,Wed Dec 24 18:42:44 +0000 2008,@SmartMarketing because you skipped math class! :P
1076726426,Wed Dec 24 18:41:51 +0000 2008,@SmartMarketing that is very insensitive, @santa even moved all his operations from the North Pole to China to meet up with demand!
1076724510,Wed Dec 24 18:40:37 +0000 2008,@eljefetwisted I will take you up on that offer! JC's wine making is a good parlor trick, but isn't as full-bodied as I would like.
1075841259,Wed Dec 24 06:27:21 +0000 2008,@harshal612 it was awful, cowardly, and misguided. horror in the name of faith and nationalism does not solve anything and never has.
1075838745,Wed Dec 24 06:24:47 +0000 2008,@SmartMarketing i know i'm god and all, but the McKinsey consultants told me that i should not micromanage Santa. he needs empowerment too.

1075793259,Wed Dec 24 05:44:28 +0000 2008,@ingo2009 easy enough to solve. go to your sink and get a glass of water. then, tell it to turn to wine. if it doesn't, you are not god.

1070165628,Sun Dec 21 06:11:54 +0000 2008,@nelsonm that looks like the hand of a god that suffers from essential tremor syndrome.
1068240301,Sat Dec 20 01:08:53 +0000 2008,@Ray_Peterson No, that is like calling antimatter the absence of matter, which it is not. Evil is not the absence of good, but anti-good.
1068236976,Sat Dec 20 01:06:25 +0000 2008,@showmyface would that make my followers polytheists?
