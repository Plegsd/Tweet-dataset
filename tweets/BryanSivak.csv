78636376509259780,Thu Jun 09 01:35:47 +0000 2011,@tsbandito so i'm working on this exact issue right now #localgovchat
78636177560842240,Thu Jun 09 01:35:00 +0000 2011,and the working environment is an important part #localgovchat

78635738262016000,Thu Jun 09 01:33:15 +0000 2011,@rupertmike right, and what about the people who sit in four hours of traffic every day? #localgovchat
78635585086038020,Thu Jun 09 01:32:39 +0000 2011,top down doesn't work. one of my favorite observations: when workers choose deliverables for themselves, usually stretch goals #localgovchat
78635390180925440,Thu Jun 09 01:31:52 +0000 2011,managers MUST collaboratively develop deliverables with their reports #localgovchat
78635315782357000,Thu Jun 09 01:31:34 +0000 2011,one critical point about tracking accountability: #localgovchat
78635236115755000,Thu Jun 09 01:31:15 +0000 2011,if it's a receptionist, maybe it's maintaining a high customer service/customer satisfaction score #localgovchat
78635141190270980,Thu Jun 09 01:30:53 +0000 2011,if I'm talking to a developer in an agile environment, maybe it's the number of points they complete in a period #localgovchat
78635035560919040,Thu Jun 09 01:30:28 +0000 2011,if I'm talking to someone processing cases, maybe I decide with them a target of cases to process in a week #localgovchat
78634948759789570,Thu Jun 09 01:30:07 +0000 2011,@S_Horv it changes depending on the individual and responsibilities.  for example: (con't) #localgovchat

78632996936237060,Thu Jun 09 01:22:22 +0000 2011,especially when they require people of different disciplines to collaborate to solve problems #localgovchat
78632895568297980,Thu Jun 09 01:21:57 +0000 2011,but contests in general are good.  I like the "grand challenges" type of innovation contest a lot #localgovchat
78632793021747200,Thu Jun 09 01:21:33 +0000 2011,I don't think you can have too many app contests in the same area, targeting the same devs #localgovchat
78632699362942980,Thu Jun 09 01:21:11 +0000 2011,we also need to be aware of developer burnout #localgovchat
78632607956475900,Thu Jun 09 01:20:49 +0000 2011,@localgovchat i think so, but we need to figure out the sustainability issue #localgovchat
78632454277177340,Thu Jun 09 01:20:12 +0000 2011,As long as we spend taxpayer $ wisely and efficiently - and not in massive amts with no feedback loops - we can make this work #localgovchat
78632199980724220,Thu Jun 09 01:19:12 +0000 2011,and the media needs to start reporting all the good work that goes on inside the concrete halls. #localgovchat
78632118435053570,Thu Jun 09 01:18:52 +0000 2011,politicians need to own failures and make the solutions the important points #localgovchat
78632014185635840,Thu Jun 09 01:18:27 +0000 2011,@g_r_e_g This is a critical point.  We as a political culture need to stop thinking that governments are perfect #localgovchat

78631605199052800,Thu Jun 09 01:16:50 +0000 2011,better yet, if someone solves a problem without bringing it to me, the problem is REALLY unimportant :) #localgovchat
78631400970006530,Thu Jun 09 01:16:01 +0000 2011,if someone comes to me with a problem and a solution, the problem is unimportant #localgovchat

78631095515611140,Thu Jun 09 01:14:48 +0000 2011,remember, it's all about selling the "what's in it for me" #localgovchat
78631003039600640,Thu Jun 09 01:14:26 +0000 2011,too often we just assume that people will simply "get it" or we fail to put ourselves in someone else's shoes #localgovchat

78630747522609150,Thu Jun 09 01:13:25 +0000 2011,But part of that is a sales pitch.  Leaders need to be sold on the benefits of taking chances #localgovchat
78630647270342660,Thu Jun 09 01:13:01 +0000 2011,@sarahebourne excellent point.  The recognition that innovation will drive things forward has to come from the top #localgovchat
78630256537387000,Thu Jun 09 01:11:28 +0000 2011,Part of the challenge is fighting the status quo.  I've found it very valuable to ask "why?"  A lot. #localgovchat

78629858934128640,Thu Jun 09 01:09:53 +0000 2011,Good question.  The most important thing is that it has to be OK to fail. We can't do new things if we can't do that. #localgovchat
