6179023219,Sun Nov 29 20:32:47 +0000 2009,(I'll add that I was not - and still am not - a huge fan of the XF. It's modern but far too generic for a non-Japanese car company.)
6178965297,Sun Nov 29 20:30:34 +0000 2009,I often talk to about "avantgarde" design - we try to do it in Chrome, it's exhilerating to see a company like Jaguar transformed by it.
6178840554,Sun Nov 29 20:25:37 +0000 2009,Given Maserati's recent meddling with the Quattroporte, I'm going to go out there and say the Jaguar XJ is actually more attractive.
6178807017,Sun Nov 29 20:24:17 +0000 2009,I was wrong re: the new Jaguar XJ. The technology is every bit as modern as the car is stunning to behold. I have found a M45 replacement.

2073886178,Mon Jun 08 07:40:39 +0000 2009,It's actually impressive that Microsoft has been able to drag this API along for so long, adding modern features alongside geriatric ones.
2073880166,Mon Jun 08 07:39:31 +0000 2009,First pass of menu change now done. As usual, the Windows API finds some way to be a bitch. Helps if you think like a programmer from 1987.

1988291713,Mon Jun 01 05:04:30 +0000 2009,@nzlemming: because the frame is part of the visual design. you can't just peel off chunks of a cohesive entity and expect it to still work.

1978863861,Sun May 31 07:44:07 +0000 2009,... WPF, MFC, GoatTK... I've actually encouraged this a few times. But I still think that by default, Google Chrome should look like Chrome.
1978840503,Sun May 31 07:39:09 +0000 2009,Alternatively, one could set aside the Chrome look, and use our intrinsically cross platform codebase to build a UI using GTK, Qt, wx...
1978834753,Sun May 31 07:37:55 +0000 2009,My question was and still is - how to create the Chrome skyline when the window frame itself is not something you can reliably manipulate?
1978799855,Sun May 31 07:30:40 +0000 2009,While not matching every aspect of the host OS visual style, Chrome's visual design was heavily influenced by it.
1978793452,Sun May 31 07:29:26 +0000 2009,Also having a dominant default visual style (Luna Blue, Aero, Leopard) means you have a stable source of inspiration.
1978775505,Sun May 31 07:25:37 +0000 2009,This turns out to be useful for an app that blurs the boundary between desktop app and "window manager for web apps".
1978773486,Sun May 31 07:25:12 +0000 2009,It means that you can create a visual design that incorporates elements of the window manager.
1978769512,Sun May 31 07:24:23 +0000 2009,It's idiosyncratic, badly documented and sometimes tear-your-hair out frustrating, but it's the only one. The same environment exists on Mac

1351784684,Thu Mar 19 01:03:44 +0000 2009,I love our codebase. I feel like I can pick it up and twist it around and build new things easily. I never had that feeling with Firefox.
1346669677,Wed Mar 18 04:27:03 +0000 2009,The Chrome front end is constructed by a factory and can probably be swapped at runtime, so multiple implementations are possible.
1346666600,Wed Mar 18 04:26:13 +0000 2009,I'd really like to see someone develop a completely native UI on top of Chromium for GNOME *and* KDE.

1309555578,Wed Mar 11 07:03:36 +0000 2009,The first two numbers we use for organizational purposes, right now they say "2.0" but they could be anything.
1309552460,Wed Mar 11 07:02:04 +0000 2009,My favorite: the build number, which I call the "comic book number" since it increases with each issue (duh) - nice and simple.
1309548692,Wed Mar 11 07:00:19 +0000 2009,With Chrome, we have a four-part version number... two halves - the ambiguous component (major.minor) and the unambiguous one (build.patch)
1309545607,Wed Mar 11 06:59:00 +0000 2009,Reading the mozilla.dev.planning thread about 3.1-&gt;3.5 renaming. Version number discussions are a honeypot for infinite random opinions.

1276520671,Wed Mar 04 01:09:40 +0000 2009,No i7 iMac? What exactly is "new" about them then? It seems Apple's reverted to shipping crappy slow hardware again.
1272371583,Tue Mar 03 04:06:43 +0000 2009,Woot. Chrome now responds to DWM activation/deactivation on Windows Vista/7. Oh and select dropdowns no longer deactivate the frame.

1154268423,Wed Jan 28 03:58:40 +0000 2009,The drop-down file list in XCode is about as infuriating as the similar selector in tabbed browsers... which is why Chrome doesn't have one.
1153278410,Tue Jan 27 21:22:25 +0000 2009,As bad as Visual Studio is, and believe me, it's bad, XCode is worse. 14 windows later... tabbed interface anyone??!
