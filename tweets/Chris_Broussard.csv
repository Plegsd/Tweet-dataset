901708209823641600,Sun Aug 27 07:29:24 +0000 2017,This was FAR from vintage Floyd. He was old &amp; rusty. Glad he's retiring. It's time. Most exciting Floyd fight in years tho!
901707897826144300,Sun Aug 27 07:28:10 +0000 2017,Good point. Again, it would be more spectacle than great boxing, but fans would want to see it https://t.co/g3y79eewkc
901706531300835300,Sun Aug 27 07:22:44 +0000 2017,Conor doesn't deserve GGG or Canelo but I could see the public buying into it
901706350048268300,Sun Aug 27 07:22:01 +0000 2017,Interesting options for Conor: go back to UFC &amp; win for less $, or take 1 big fight vs GGG/Canelo winner &amp; get flattened for big $
901705913379295200,Sun Aug 27 07:20:17 +0000 2017,McGregor showed enough that a fight vs GGG/Canelo might make a ton of $. He would get demolished, but get more bread than UFC could offer.
901669402504024000,Sun Aug 27 04:55:12 +0000 2017,"Little hands, little head, little torso." Little stamina! But big heart by Conor. I'll give him that.
901669043899433000,Sun Aug 27 04:53:46 +0000 2017,What kind of conditioning was McGregor doing? My goodness.
901668873530990600,Sun Aug 27 04:53:06 +0000 2017,Premature stoppage but McGregor was on his way out. Floyd's old and Conor has no power.
901213470321934300,Fri Aug 25 22:43:29 +0000 2017,McGregor will get frustrated by 3rd round, begin swinging wildly &amp; making mistakes, leaving himself open to get pummeled &amp; bloody. TKO in 8
