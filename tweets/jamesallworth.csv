587540071386984400,Mon Apr 13 08:57:23 +0000 2015,@cremnob I‚Äôm not sure their rationale for projects inside of X (for example) is focused on stock price
587539001743028200,Mon Apr 13 08:53:08 +0000 2015,@cremnob @eric_analytics I have strong opinions about it too. And I think Jobs was right to ignore them.
587538918699970600,Mon Apr 13 08:52:48 +0000 2015,@cremnob but that‚Äôs the point! because they aren‚Äôt subjected to market pressures, they can pursue long term projects even tho ads not ^^

587534174317183000,Mon Apr 13 08:33:57 +0000 2015,@cremnob sure, it‚Äôs hard to ignore. But they can‚Äôt actually do anything. There‚Äôs no firing the CEO!
587533983941926900,Mon Apr 13 08:33:12 +0000 2015,@cremnob I‚Äôm not sure I agree. The market got it wrong. But it‚Äôs ability to mess with the company was limited.

587520621275324400,Mon Apr 13 07:40:06 +0000 2015,@cremnob well, of course, when business is strong it‚Äôs irrelevant. it‚Äôs how much market pressure you let in if it‚Äôs not that‚Äôs the question
587520536571326500,Mon Apr 13 07:39:46 +0000 2015,@cremnob it doesn‚Äôt take all the pressure away, but it does mean that management has the luxury of a long term time horizon

549683807289221100,Mon Dec 29 21:50:06 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent truck license and bus license are different, no?
549675376520073200,Mon Dec 29 21:16:36 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent and if you have a car license, why does it matter whether you know the people who are in the car or not?
549675321427894300,Mon Dec 29 21:16:23 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent i‚Äôm not anti-regulation. but if you have a bus license, it‚Äôs nuts to think you won‚Äôt have kids on it
549674018211508200,Mon Dec 29 21:11:13 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent the regulator should assume that the bus they‚Äôre licensing you for will always be filled with kids
549673935101366300,Mon Dec 29 21:10:53 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent if you have a license to drive a bus, then yes
549673513997439000,Mon Dec 29 21:09:12 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent because you‚Äôre either safe to be on the roads, or you‚Äôre not
549673233423683600,Mon Dec 29 21:08:05 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent a bus license should be good for a school bus
549673190134259700,Mon Dec 29 21:07:55 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @monkbent my point is that i think the standard should be universal. a drivers license should be good for a taxi
549668364277149700,Mon Dec 29 20:48:45 +0000 2014,@GiladNaor @exponentfm @monkbent if someone‚Äôs licensed to drive a bus, shouldn‚Äôt it be ok for them to be licensed to drive a school‚Äôs?
