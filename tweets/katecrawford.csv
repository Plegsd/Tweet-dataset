705407328779161600,Thu Mar 03 14:59:47 +0000 2016,Repeat after me: 'just using public data' doesn't make it ethical. Just because you're researchers doesn't mean you're not doxxing.

705403885020684300,Thu Mar 03 14:46:06 +0000 2016,Honestly, the only way this possibly makes sense is that the article is by Banksy himself. Which would make it his best work ever.
