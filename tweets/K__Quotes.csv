955974689532325900,Wed Jan 24 01:25:01 +0000 2018,Within the pattern of duality there is no truth, however much we may be caught in it. If we seek truth in it we will be led to delusions
955582119706755100,Mon Jan 22 23:25:05 +0000 2018,Change or reform merely within the pattern of duality produces only further confusion and pain and hence is retrogression.

953317197912395800,Tue Jan 16 17:25:06 +0000 2018,Why do we judge ourselves? Is not our judgment the outcome of our desire to become something, to gain, to conform, to protect ourselves?

948032376478879700,Tue Jan 02 03:25:06 +0000 2018,The meditative mind has its own ecstasy, which is not to be put into words.
947654891450847200,Mon Jan 01 02:25:07 +0000 2018,Ecstasy is not personal, ecstasy is not yours or mine, just as love is not yours or mine.

945012478483759100,Sun Dec 24 19:25:07 +0000 2017,Be so completely attentive to every reaction and in that attention you will see that there is no observer or thinker or experiencer at all
944634988993175600,Sat Dec 23 18:25:06 +0000 2017,Have you looked at a tree, at a face, at a mountain or cloud, just to observe without translating it into like or dislike, pleasure or pain?
944257504241946600,Fri Dec 22 17:25:07 +0000 2017,Meditation is the way of life, every day – only then that which is imperishable, which has no time, can come into being.
943880014944198700,Thu Dec 21 16:25:06 +0000 2017,Meditation has everything to do with life; it isn’t going off into some emotional, ecstatic state.

942747555078852600,Mon Dec 18 13:25:07 +0000 2017,If you have taken stock at the end of the day of what has happened and therefore brought order, then in sleep the brain is quiet, learning
942370068759015400,Sun Dec 17 12:25:07 +0000 2017,The brain can be quiet, not through any trick, not through taking a drug, but through active and also passive awareness throughout the day
941992574964961300,Sat Dec 16 11:25:05 +0000 2017,There is the discarding of all traditions, so that the mind is completely free  and the brain is completely quiet

939727653032091600,Sun Dec 10 05:25:06 +0000 2017,It is not that there is understanding first and action follows; it is simultaneous, one movement.
939350165844119600,Sat Dec 09 04:25:06 +0000 2017,Understanding is not an intellectual process; understanding is not an intuition or a feeling.
938972679473975300,Fri Dec 08 03:25:06 +0000 2017,One has to be a teacher to oneself and a disciple of oneself; there is no authority, there is only understanding.

938217707471822800,Wed Dec 06 01:25:07 +0000 2017,Morality comes naturally, inevitably, sweetly when you begin to understand yourself, aware of your thoughts, feelings, activities, appetites
937840221038760000,Tue Dec 05 00:25:07 +0000 2017,To meditate in the deepest sense of the word one must be virtuous, moral; not the morality of a pattern, a practice, or of the social order
937462735012589600,Sun Dec 03 23:25:07 +0000 2017,A mind that is making an effort can never be quiet; through effort the mind can never become completely still.
937085240446775300,Sat Dec 02 22:25:06 +0000 2017,There is the conflict between what you are and what should be according to a system. This means there is effort.
936707755464908800,Fri Dec 01 21:25:06 +0000 2017,The whole meaning of meditation is in the mind becoming completely quiet, not only at the conscious level but at the deep, hidden levels
936330274115342300,Thu Nov 30 20:25:08 +0000 2017,Meditation cannot be traditional; no one can teach you; you cannot follow a particular path
935952782074445800,Wed Nov 29 19:25:07 +0000 2017,Any form of tradition, a carry-over from the past, which is used to find out if there is a reality, is obviously a waste of endeavour
935575295133933600,Tue Nov 28 18:25:07 +0000 2017,We follow, conform, obey, practise what we have been told, day after day, like machines
935197809040642000,Mon Nov 27 17:25:07 +0000 2017,Meditation is that quality of silence, of observation, in which the observer is not.

934065379466457100,Fri Nov 24 14:25:15 +0000 2017,Without a deep austerity - not the harsh austerity of the monk - our behaviour in daily life leads only to disorder
933687852747116500,Thu Nov 23 13:25:05 +0000 2017,The very act of learning demands discipline, a discipline which is not imposed nor accommodating itself to an ideology
933310367022944300,Wed Nov 22 12:25:06 +0000 2017,Social morality is no morality
932932878459011100,Tue Nov 21 11:25:05 +0000 2017,Put aside every form of belief, then there is no fear whatsoever
932555391812231200,Mon Nov 20 10:25:06 +0000 2017,Life being what it is – rather shallow, empty, a tortuous affair without much meaning – one tries to invent a significance, a meaning.
932177907375661000,Sun Nov 19 09:25:06 +0000 2017,Man, realizing his life is very short, full of sorrow and inevitable death, has always formulated an idea which is called God
931800421760454700,Sat Nov 18 08:25:07 +0000 2017,When you see a beautiful tree or the movement of a cloud across the sky, be completely aware of what is happening within and without
931422926733303800,Fri Nov 17 07:25:05 +0000 2017,When it has discarded the traditional approach, the approach of analysis, resistance, time, then what has happened to the mind itself?
931045449083052000,Thu Nov 16 06:25:07 +0000 2017,Analysis is not the way
930667956824047600,Wed Nov 15 05:25:06 +0000 2017,In the process of analysis time is involved. At the end of many years I am still afraid.
930290461583003600,Tue Nov 14 04:25:04 +0000 2017,Conscious effort to examine deeper content of the mind is extremely difficult unless the surface mind is completely free from conditioning
929912984503283700,Mon Nov 13 03:25:07 +0000 2017,Thinking about the past pain brings fear of its repetition; thought brings fear upon itself.

929158005928681500,Sat Nov 11 01:25:06 +0000 2017,When there is fear there is darkness
928765423633432600,Thu Nov 09 23:25:07 +0000 2017,Understand the nature and structure of fear, then you will be able to deal with the particular fear.
928387932293140500,Wed Nov 08 22:25:06 +0000 2017,Are we going to deal with a particular fear, or are we dealing with the fact of fear itself?
928010444631142400,Tue Nov 07 21:25:06 +0000 2017,If I come upon fear with past knowledge I do not come face to face with fear and therefore I do not learn about it
927632960496468000,Mon Nov 06 20:25:07 +0000 2017,We are not talking about being free from fear. Being free from something is not freedom.
926899376194285600,Sat Nov 04 19:50:06 +0000 2017,To be free of fear what is required is not resistance over time but the energy that can meet this habit and dissolve it immediately
926521869884411900,Fri Nov 03 18:50:02 +0000 2017,Struggle against a particular habit develops a form of resistance to that habit. Resistance in any form breeds more conflict.

925766906392563700,Wed Nov 01 16:50:05 +0000 2017,When you give your whole attention to the fact then you have the energy to dissipate it and therefore you can live freely
925389426477461500,Tue Oct 31 15:50:06 +0000 2017,You have abundance of energy when there is no wastage through conflict
925011938328895500,Mon Oct 30 14:50:06 +0000 2017,When you see the wastage of energy, the absurdity of having ideals, formulas, concepts, then you have the energy to live without them.
924634443108749300,Sun Oct 29 13:50:04 +0000 2017,Energy is being dissipated in conflict. The ideal is over there and you are here, and you are trying to live according to that.
924241864450101200,Sat Oct 28 11:50:06 +0000 2017,Silently find a new way of looking and therefore a new way of living and acting
923864357443948500,Fri Oct 27 10:50:02 +0000 2017,What you have learned must remain dormant, quiet – then you will discover something new
923486887909748700,Thu Oct 26 09:50:06 +0000 2017,Attention is not something mysterious or occult which you have to practise for years and years; that is all sheer nonsense.
923109403196305400,Wed Oct 25 08:50:06 +0000 2017,To discover something new, something that has never been looked at, there must be intense attention without any movement
922731893828784100,Tue Oct 24 07:50:01 +0000 2017,When there is not the centre of the ‘me’ who is observing, you are intimately in contact with that which you observe.
922354427503284200,Mon Oct 23 06:50:06 +0000 2017,Can you look at something so completely that the space between you – the observer – and the thing observed disappears?
921976941674225700,Sun Oct 22 05:50:07 +0000 2017,When there is interference by an image of any kind, subtle or obvious, then there is no observation, there is no real, total awareness
921599455534764000,Sat Oct 21 04:50:07 +0000 2017,To observe clearly there must be no image coming in between the observer and the thing observed.
921221944371953700,Fri Oct 20 03:50:01 +0000 2017,Can you observe anything – a tree, your partner, a neighbour, a politician, a priest, a beautiful face – without any movement of the mind?
920844481502597100,Thu Oct 19 02:50:07 +0000 2017,Time and thought do not end the past, for time and thought are the past.
920466992884277200,Wed Oct 18 01:50:07 +0000 2017,The past is not to be wiped away through time. Time is not the way to freedom.
920089506522341400,Tue Oct 17 00:50:07 +0000 2017,The perception, the total observation of jealousy and the freedom from it, is not a matter of time
919696901003292700,Sun Oct 15 22:50:02 +0000 2017,If we observe habits attentively, completely with our heart and mind, we are intelligently aware of their whole content; there is freedom.
919319429887885300,Sat Oct 14 21:50:06 +0000 2017,Basically I am lonely. And that is why I am jealous. Can I understand this loneliness immediately?
918941944297824300,Fri Oct 13 20:50:07 +0000 2017,The person I depended upon left me and I am suddenly faced with my emptiness, with my isolation and I am afraid of that.
918564448033542100,Thu Oct 12 19:50:05 +0000 2017,What matters is to see the fact as it is now, without any distortion.
918186966738448400,Wed Oct 11 18:50:06 +0000 2017,The idea of getting rid of violence gradually is a form of hypocrisy.
917809475490369500,Tue Oct 10 17:50:05 +0000 2017,To live is to love  and to die.
917054503328895000,Sun Oct 08 15:50:06 +0000 2017,Dying is part of living. Living, loving and dying are the same thing, which consists in living wholly, completely, now.
916677005583798300,Sat Oct 07 14:50:03 +0000 2017,How you live today is going to sow the seed of beauty or the seed of sorrow
916299533054873600,Fri Oct 06 13:50:07 +0000 2017,What you do now, today, matters, not how you are going to live when you are born into your next life – if there is such a thing
915922038866497500,Thu Oct 05 12:50:05 +0000 2017,Being afraid of death, we wonder if we will live again – which is to continue the battle, conflict, misery, the accumulated experience.
915544554685833200,Wed Oct 04 11:50:06 +0000 2017,We are the past, we are time, sorrow and despair, with an occasional perception of beauty, a flowering of goodness or deep tenderness.
915167066575048700,Tue Oct 03 10:50:06 +0000 2017,You have a lot of ideas about God, goodness, truth, what society should be. Therein lies sorrow.
914789580515283000,Mon Oct 02 09:50:06 +0000 2017,Isn’t it very strange that you spend forty years going to the office and when you stop doing these things you have heart trouble and die?
914034598715297800,Sat Sep 30 07:50:04 +0000 2017,We have carefully put the question of dying far away from us. We are afraid of coming to an end.
913657118787436500,Fri Sep 29 06:50:06 +0000 2017,There is complete order of the highest form, which is virtue. That can come only when there is love.
913279611756318700,Thu Sep 28 05:50:02 +0000 2017,Virtue is the very essence of order
912902137419624400,Wed Sep 27 04:50:05 +0000 2017,When a mind struggles to be virtuous, moral, ethical, it resists, and in that very conflict there is disorder.
912524653872246800,Tue Sep 26 03:50:06 +0000 2017,There must be order, deep, mathematical order. Is this order to be brought about by conforming to a pattern which we consider to be orderly?

844292560214528000,Tue Mar 21 21:00:07 +0000 2017,Where there is fragmentation there must be conflict, misery; the very essence of conflict is the division, the contradiction in us.
