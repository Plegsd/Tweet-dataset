763809524817985500,Thu Aug 11 18:49:16 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A5 1/2 I see measurement becoming more qualitative and less quantitative https://t.co/agXvApuEHR
763808993013862400,Thu Aug 11 18:47:09 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A4 I have spoken at conferences on how #SIAM is actually a function of #DevOps and aggregates these now https://t.co/S4DrXscw6X
763808045910679600,Thu Aug 11 18:43:23 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A4 2/2 However this is governed by the shared responsibility model and mitigated through broker/integrator https://t.co/S4DrXscw6X
763807743849398300,Thu Aug 11 18:42:11 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A4. 1/2 Enterprise contracts are different than click-thru contracts. The former do have some of this https://t.co/S4DrXscw6X
763804818934759400,Thu Aug 11 18:30:34 +0000 2016,#CIOChat yes, internal stakeholders still don't get it and introduce latency and delays https://t.co/iX3F0zdoQF
763804323545485300,Thu Aug 11 18:28:36 +0000 2016,Agreed #CIOChat https://t.co/2m6sW2L594

763804142913654800,Thu Aug 11 18:27:53 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A3 2/2 this is a good reason to introduce cloud brokers to provide a tie back to traditional mgmt schemes https://t.co/PKGDC29QVD
763803805074985000,Thu Aug 11 18:26:32 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A3 1/2 public cloud/SaaS has changed the game-there is much more of a shared responsibility model https://t.co/PKGDC29QVD
763803100192837600,Thu Aug 11 18:23:44 +0000 2016,@LarryLarmeu @MylesSuer @psalvitti you can't measure or do accurate problem mgmt in this environment
763803001022808000,Thu Aug 11 18:23:20 +0000 2016,@LarryLarmeu @MylesSuer @psalvitti 85% of biz I talk to do not have common descriptions for assets across vendors
763802794939867100,Thu Aug 11 18:22:31 +0000 2016,@LarryLarmeu @MylesSuer @psalvitti mkt is too competitive for this behavior now, issue is usually borked svc mgmt and failed integration
763802352923119600,Thu Aug 11 18:20:46 +0000 2016,#CIOChat I see this more so when biz tries to handle #SIAM for themselves. difficult to be in both roles https://t.co/eiWGtbvvOy
763801810486358000,Thu Aug 11 18:18:37 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A2 #1 thing I work w/ customers on is what should be measured. Today's SLAs don't equate to satisfaction https://t.co/eChGWGQuAr
763799779428237300,Thu Aug 11 18:10:32 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A1 2/2 IT vendor mgmt today requires collaboration and incentive to work to solve complex problems w/ deep dependencies
763799158205640700,Thu Aug 11 18:08:04 +0000 2016,#CIOChat A1 Vendor mgmt is still a mess for many biz. Lack of success outsourcing and bringing inside b/c silo approach w/ no horizontal
