786396498116415500,Thu Oct 13 02:41:50 +0000 2016,10/12) Sinister. A true crime author with writer's block moves his family into a murder house and learns much more than he bargained for.
786028674739015700,Wed Oct 12 02:20:14 +0000 2016,10/11) The Fly (86). Another inventive remake, this time from pro mind-bender David Cronenberg. Monster movie meets Kafka...and Goldblum.
785913672518565900,Tue Oct 11 18:43:15 +0000 2016,10/10) Cape Fear (91). Scorcese boldly remakes a classic 1962 thriller &amp; coaxes a genius performance from De Niro as a vengeful ex-con.
785316499988815900,Mon Oct 10 03:10:18 +0000 2016,10/9) Evil Dead 2. One of the more delightfully insane horror movie sequels ever made.
784853619808108500,Sat Oct 08 20:30:59 +0000 2016,10/8) Land of the Dead. After a 20 year absence, George A. Romero returns home to the tried and true zombie genre he created.
784615883146756100,Sat Oct 08 04:46:18 +0000 2016,Last time I spoke to anyone in a locker room it was John Slattery. I was like "I'm doing Long Day's" he was like "I'm doing The Front Page."
784537205175947300,Fri Oct 07 23:33:40 +0000 2016,10/7) They Live. The masterful John Carpenter serves up scary social satire, campy commentary &amp; one of the most epic fight scenes ever.
784218902364622800,Fri Oct 07 02:28:51 +0000 2016,10/6) The Last House on the Left ('09). I rarely get down with remakes of classics but a killer cast and a refusal to dilute make this one.
783778450104578000,Wed Oct 05 21:18:39 +0000 2016,10/5) The Relic. The Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child bestseller gets a mostly loyal big screen treatment in this museum set creature feature.
783401848589914100,Tue Oct 04 20:22:10 +0000 2016,10/4) The Legend of Hell House. The brilliant Richard Matheson adapts his bold and spine tingling haunted house novel for the big screen.
783034446555611100,Mon Oct 03 20:02:14 +0000 2016,10/3) It. I still adore this Stephen King miniseries. Both eras of the Losers Club are wonderfully cast &amp; Tim Curry slays as Pennywise.
782987490772787200,Mon Oct 03 16:55:39 +0000 2016,I'm playing a show with my band at @RockwoodNYC Stage 2 on Friday, October 14th at 10 pm. Come hang with us.
782651672447316000,Sun Oct 02 18:41:14 +0000 2016,10/2) Green Room. 1 of the most original, horrific, genre-bending scary movies I've ever seen &amp; a showcase for the late great Anton Yelchin.
782649940275322900,Sun Oct 02 18:34:21 +0000 2016,@patrick_brice @MarkDuplass I love your movie! Can't wait for the next installment.
782285745671270400,Sat Oct 01 18:27:10 +0000 2016,10/1) Creep. Patrick Brice &amp; Mark Duplass add a funny &amp; unsettling twist to indie found footage in this simple character driven sleeper.
782284045556260900,Sat Oct 01 18:20:25 +0000 2016,Well, it's that time of the year again. October! I'll be tweeting a horror movie recommendation everyday until Halloween. Here. We. Go.

660552388131057700,Sat Oct 31 20:22:16 +0000 2015,10/31) Halloween H20. Steve Miner brings back Jaime Lee Curtis and offers the most loyal take on Michael Myers since the Carpenter days.
660549550877360100,Sat Oct 31 20:11:00 +0000 2015,And the final horror movie recommendation for the month of October is...............
660263685814886400,Sat Oct 31 01:15:04 +0000 2015,10/30) The Craft. High school cliques can be evil. In this movie they are actual witches. I had the album &amp; a crush on Fairuza Balk in '96.
659958592087449600,Fri Oct 30 05:02:44 +0000 2015,10/29) Shocker. The late great Wes Craven creates yet another crazed and ruthless serial killer who operates beyond the material world.
659550773257351200,Thu Oct 29 02:02:12 +0000 2015,10/28) Seven. To be honest I wouldn't put this Fincher knockout in the horror section but it does get under the skin in ways few others can.
659481585503371300,Wed Oct 28 21:27:17 +0000 2015,Thrilled to announce I'll be opening for the fantastic @anaismitchell Fri/Nov 6 at Marblehead, MA's @MeTheeCoffee! https://t.co/J3Dd2Mtcu8
659147993866719200,Tue Oct 27 23:21:42 +0000 2015,10/27) Drag Me to Hell. Sam Raimi delighted superfans (myself included) by returning to his horror roots in this fun tale of a spooky curse.
658785886281273300,Mon Oct 26 23:22:49 +0000 2015,10/26) Slither. The great James Gunn leads a killer cast to fun, campy, gory sci-if/horror/comedy glory in this fresh creature feature.
658377588717539300,Sun Oct 25 20:20:23 +0000 2015,10/25) Wolf Creek. Aussie-indie features a charming and maniacal villain for the ages, makes you think twice about camping in the outback.
658041868496818200,Sat Oct 24 22:06:21 +0000 2015,10/24) Black Christmas. This POV heavy chiller was made 4 years before Halloween and is considered to be one of the first slasher films.
657732981474369500,Sat Oct 24 01:38:57 +0000 2015,10/23) Cujo. Simple premise of a mother and son trapped in a stalled car being circled by a rabid dog elevated by great editing.
657329590545829900,Thu Oct 22 22:56:01 +0000 2015,10/22) Dead Silence. James Wan starts to play with the freaky witch &amp; creepy doll imagery he'll later perfect in Insidious &amp; The Conjuring.
656991923903819800,Thu Oct 22 00:34:15 +0000 2015,So delightful to see the amazing Marylouise Burke reunited with @lindsayabaire in his beautiful new play Ripcord at @MTC_NYC last night!
656940028778692600,Wed Oct 21 21:08:02 +0000 2015,10/21) From Dusk Till Dawn. The pairing of Quentin Tarantino &amp; Robert Rodriguez makes for a fun, twisted, raucous outlaw vampire adventure.
656581768364073000,Tue Oct 20 21:24:26 +0000 2015,10/20) Slumber Party Massacre. Written as a sexism revealing slasher flick satire but then directed in earnest. The results are fascinating.
656209614309060600,Mon Oct 19 20:45:38 +0000 2015,10/19) Kill List. I still don't really know what happened in this mysterious bloody British head trip about hit men but it freaked me out.

655875505451831300,Sun Oct 18 22:38:00 +0000 2015,10/18) The Vanishing. Tastefully paced, scary, somber and unpredictable Dutch-French film about a man's search for his missing girlfriend.
655520613214326800,Sat Oct 17 23:07:47 +0000 2015,10/17) Oculus. The great Mike Flanagan serves up a wildly imaginative and sure handed tale about a haunted mirror. At once simple and epic.
655149001336078300,Fri Oct 16 22:31:08 +0000 2015,10/16) High Tension. It may be a rip off of Intensity by Dean Koontz &amp; the plot twist may be thin but the 1st 30 mins are brutal &amp; scarring.
655054834975035400,Fri Oct 16 16:16:57 +0000 2015,Hey Wilmington, Delaware. Come on out to this show tomorrow night. I'll be doing a few tunes &amp; so will my parents! http://t.co/sBRnZDekC2

654733147330863100,Thu Oct 15 18:58:41 +0000 2015,10/15) The Dead Zone. Cronenberg does King. Walken predicts catastrophic events. Sheen plays a much meaner politician than Jed Bartlet.
654717824456220700,Thu Oct 15 17:57:48 +0000 2015,Oh man the new @ALTisyourenemy record In the Blazes is rocking my friggin' face off today. Buy it on @iTunes and let it do the same to you!
654356919109451800,Wed Oct 14 18:03:41 +0000 2015,10/14) The Host. Visionary Joon-ho Bong puts a surreal &amp; sublime spin on the creature feature complete w/environmentalist pro-fam message.
654015889478668300,Tue Oct 13 19:28:33 +0000 2015,10/13) Re-Animator. This loose  adaptation of an H.P Lovecraft story evens out gory thrills with plenty of goofy and perverse irreverence.
654008779281944600,Tue Oct 13 19:00:18 +0000 2015,@loquaciousmuse Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

653673391069732900,Mon Oct 12 20:47:35 +0000 2015,10/12) When a Stranger Calls. Worth it alone for the terrifying opening scene featuring Carol Kane as a spooked and stalked babysitter.
653432728235458600,Mon Oct 12 04:51:17 +0000 2015,Thank you NYC! That was so fun. Nice to know John Prine fans are out there and ready to throw down with me on a Sunday night. Such a treat.

653278461205827600,Sun Oct 11 18:38:17 +0000 2015,10/11) In the Mouth of Madness. A fun mind bender from the masterful John Carpenter about a horror writer whose novels have sinister powers.
653271240631787500,Sun Oct 11 18:09:35 +0000 2015,@EMortimer You'll be there in spirit! And I'll be DVRing Doll and Em while I'm at the gig.

652519745359642600,Fri Oct 09 16:23:25 +0000 2015,10/9) Them. This 2006 French Romanian home invasion thriller stands out from the crowd thanks to a chilly dose of realism &amp; a freaky twist.
652341002640969700,Fri Oct 09 04:33:09 +0000 2015,I bet you didn't know there was an Untouchables video game. I didn't either. Until just now. Looks kinda fun. http://t.co/kZFY1G1Q5w

652204336487997400,Thu Oct 08 19:30:05 +0000 2015,10/8) Day of the Dead. Probably the darkest of Romero's Dead films but with striking visuals &amp; themes to be copied by future zombie movies.
651815013360005100,Wed Oct 07 17:43:03 +0000 2015,10/7) Child's Play. Before Annabelle there was the foul mouthed knife wielding possessed doll Chucky voiced with evil glee by Brad Dourif.
651466608817406000,Tue Oct 06 18:38:37 +0000 2015,10/6) Lady in White. Dunno how it holds up but this ghost story murder mystery terrified me as a kid. Len Cariou+Lukas Haas+Alex Rocco=üëçüèª.
651127971814711300,Mon Oct 05 20:13:00 +0000 2015,10/5) The Amityville Horror. Despite post release debunking of the "true" source material, this remains an influential haunted house entry.
650742070458630100,Sun Oct 04 18:39:34 +0000 2015,@DannyTRS It's that time of year again! It's definitely either the most fun or the most annoying thing I do on Twitter.
650741890128715800,Sun Oct 04 18:38:51 +0000 2015,10/4) New Nightmare. The late great Wes Craven returned to reinvent the stagnant Freddy franchise he created in this meta post modern gem.

649713093933707300,Thu Oct 01 22:30:47 +0000 2015,10/1) The Babadook. A nightmarish yet beautiful take on the power of grief. This Aussie indie features the creepiest children's book ever.

522096308740718600,Tue Oct 14 18:47:14 +0000 2014,10/14) My Bloody Valentine. In the slasher flick boom of the early 80s this inventive tale of a vengeful coal miner is a cut above the rest.

520999882698797060,Sat Oct 11 18:10:26 +0000 2014,10/11) Saw. A great example of budget driving story. Forced to simplify, James Wan &amp; Leigh Whannell embraced circumstance full freaky force.

519564299912482800,Tue Oct 07 19:05:56 +0000 2014,10/7) Don't Look Now. More of an art house drama about grief &amp; prophecy than traditional "horror" but still as haunting as any ghost story.

283067984602345470,Mon Dec 24 04:34:01 +0000 2012,I warned my parents I might cry as I did in the theater during Batman's fight with Bane in the sewer. My mother thus covered her eyes.
283055841479913470,Mon Dec 24 03:45:46 +0000 2012,Turning the volume up enough for whispery dialogue in The Dark Knight Rises to be heard makes Bane sound like the bass in Helter Skelter.
283033275302293500,Mon Dec 24 02:16:05 +0000 2012,"Rockin' around the Christmas tree. Have a crazy, crazy time." My revised lyrics to a classic holiday tune.

281246887418421250,Wed Dec 19 03:57:37 +0000 2012,Guy in Urban Outfitters earlier: "Damn this a cool store." Like I said CHOICE BYTES.
281243398466318340,Wed Dec 19 03:43:46 +0000 2012,Girlfriend 1: "Awh he's so cute. Wait does he know you're in a relationship?" Girlfriend 2: "No." The city is alive w/ choice bytes 2nite.

278305573831856130,Tue Dec 11 01:09:54 +0000 2012,Since a few people have asked, it looks like there will most likely be two new tunes on 1/5 @ Rockwood. A cover and an original. Come hear!
276861387324661760,Fri Dec 07 01:31:13 +0000 2012,I'm drowning my sorrows 'cause I had just kicked off a 96 hour trip to New York that was downgraded to a 24 hour jaunt.

273329964777103360,Tue Nov 27 07:38:36 +0000 2012,At least one Scandal crew guy hates me after I walked onto their set today thinking it was catering. I was wrong. I went in the wrong door.
271796579843862530,Fri Nov 23 02:05:29 +0000 2012,Why isn't The Last Waltz on every single channel right now? Whatever. Still hella thankful.

270646459030962180,Mon Nov 19 21:55:18 +0000 2012,By that I mean there's always a lot of crying, hallucinating and a slow dolly zoom.
270451060525658100,Mon Nov 19 08:58:52 +0000 2012,Rick's phone call on The Walking Dead tonight is pretty much how I am on the phone in all relationships. Pretty cool right?
270433960843173900,Mon Nov 19 07:50:55 +0000 2012,My Sunday night TV shows are just killing me as of late. Three hours of loss and mortality! Hoping for uplifting finales. I'm too effected!
270030389056266240,Sun Nov 18 05:07:16 +0000 2012,I would really like to teach a spin class mainly because I could force people to listen to a playlist I made.
270028289626763260,Sun Nov 18 04:58:55 +0000 2012,Took a spin class. Already drenched and panting when American Idiot came on and sparked an intense top of show flashback. Almost passed out.
270010773701541900,Sun Nov 18 03:49:19 +0000 2012,Drummer just busted out a spoon solo. This show has everything!
270009583693623300,Sun Nov 18 03:44:35 +0000 2012,I'm pretty sure The Big Chill era Glenn Close just sang a country duet with Bill Paxton's character from True Lies.

268481284995678200,Tue Nov 13 22:31:41 +0000 2012,Thinking of cashing it all in &amp; being a P.I. The lifestyle would suit me and my apt is good for a P.I. I blame this on The Long Goodbye.
268422367133446140,Tue Nov 13 18:37:34 +0000 2012,I'm a little nervous about Hostess snack cakes possible liquidation 'cause I don't think it'll taste that good to drink a Twinkie.

267553994052866050,Sun Nov 11 09:06:57 +0000 2012,Saw a great print of Paths of Glory at LACMA tonight. Actor Joe Turkel showed up to tell a few stories about Kubrick. What a treat!
267401451645566980,Sat Nov 10 23:00:48 +0000 2012,It's a humbling moment for both persons when you drive by a guy changing into a wookie costume in a parking garage in Hollywood.
267184495353012220,Sat Nov 10 08:38:42 +0000 2012,@ALTisyourenemy Yyyeeaaahhh! Just caught the West Coast broadcast. Ya look good! Ya sound good!

266714396670173200,Fri Nov 09 01:30:42 +0000 2012,Not fair that Japandroids and Titus Andronicus are playing LA on the same night but not under the same roof. Maybe I should flip a coin.
266462760467062800,Thu Nov 08 08:50:47 +0000 2012,Holy smokes. I think Michael "Iron Man" Shannon was just responsible for one of the best scenes in the history of Boardwalk Empire.
266072673715642370,Wed Nov 07 07:00:43 +0000 2012,F...ING...A
263834682737709060,Thu Nov 01 02:47:44 +0000 2012,There you have it! 31 days, 31 scary movies. Happy Halloween everyone. Have fun out there, stay safe, be good to each other.
263832396275781630,Thu Nov 01 02:38:39 +0000 2012,10/31. Halloween. One of my horror heroes John Carpenter broke the mold when he basically invented the modern slasher flick as we know it.
263766616678993920,Wed Oct 31 22:17:16 +0000 2012,10/30. The Exorcist. 1 of my fav films ever made. Friedken's take on Blatty's mortifying novel is nothing short of pure cinematic genius.
263743381279227900,Wed Oct 31 20:44:56 +0000 2012,10/29. The Haunting. The original. The quintessential "hey let's go spend the night in this haunted house" movie. Also...Russ Tamblyn!
262800176505294850,Mon Oct 29 06:16:59 +0000 2012,10/28. Alien. The trailer alone for Ridley Scott's deep space nightmare masterpiece gives me chills every time. A perfect film all over.
262595430418874370,Sun Oct 28 16:43:24 +0000 2012,10/27. The Mist. Frank Darabont's take on Stephen King's apocalyptic tale of trapped supermarket patrons. 1 of the best King films IMHO.
262372045843755000,Sun Oct 28 01:55:45 +0000 2012,About to do some songs at PostCrypt coffee house @ Columbia University. All songs will be to the tune of Tales From the Crypt theme song.
262366009472716800,Sun Oct 28 01:31:45 +0000 2012,If you'd told me that one day Lara Croft would invite me to a party and I'd decline I would've laughed in your face. Ha! But it's true.
262233831149555700,Sat Oct 27 16:46:32 +0000 2012,10/26. The Sixth Sense. A surprise home run of by then unknown M. Night Shyamalan. Great concept, scares, film craft and performances.
261733545670754300,Fri Oct 26 07:38:34 +0000 2012,10/25. The Last House on the Left. Lose the distracting music &amp; odd comic relief cop duo &amp; voila; Wes Craven's revolutionary indie horror.
261345595250335740,Thu Oct 25 05:57:00 +0000 2012,10/24. Shaun of the Dead. Saw it's original release in theaters in London. Jumped and laughed 'til I cried. Spot on zombie satire/homage.
260997349776711680,Wed Oct 24 06:53:11 +0000 2012,10/23. Let the Right One In. An entirely original spin on vampires makes this less of a horror film and more of a coming of age love tale.
260673599030042620,Tue Oct 23 09:26:43 +0000 2012,10/22. The Omen. It's all for you Damien!
260535245680570370,Tue Oct 23 00:16:57 +0000 2012,I'll be stopping by The Bedford in Williamsburg tonight to do a tune or two at Shayni Rae's Truckstop. Gunna see my pal @ALTisyourenemy !
260406472335294460,Mon Oct 22 15:45:15 +0000 2012,We must all deeply thank @PunkRockMarthas for renovating the Elliott Smith Figure 8 wall in LA to a most well deserved memorial condition.
260404920136634370,Mon Oct 22 15:39:05 +0000 2012,@PunkRockMarthas Thank you so much for renovating the memorial wall. I drive by it all the time &amp; it broke my heart how far it fell. Bravo!
260282016120074240,Mon Oct 22 07:30:43 +0000 2012,10/21. Wait Until Dark. No ghosts/goblins just a trend setting "bad guy" performance by Alan Arkin as he terrorizes a blind Audrey Hepburn.
259882624888213500,Sun Oct 21 05:03:40 +0000 2012,@ScottPorter You can come to the child naming ceremony! Wait does that exist? Is that a thing?
259770774964035600,Sat Oct 20 21:39:13 +0000 2012,10/20. Rosemary's Baby. All of them witches! This one is so well done and gets right under your skin. Even Charles Grodin is creepy!
259496307415187460,Sat Oct 20 03:28:35 +0000 2012,How much do you think my kid is gonna love me when I name them Dillon Panther Gallagher 'cause I think probably a lot.
259462321238319100,Sat Oct 20 01:13:32 +0000 2012,10/19. The Shining. Sure Kubrick was less than faithful to King's brilliant novel but with results so stunning it's a forgivable offense.
259130349169283070,Fri Oct 19 03:14:24 +0000 2012,The trailer for Flight proves it is baller and doesn't give a f by featuring both Feelin' Alright AND Gimme Shelter.
259113853621792770,Fri Oct 19 02:08:51 +0000 2012,10/18. Stir of Echoes. David Koepp directs adaptation of Richard Matheson's book. Widely overlooked due to release close to The Sixth Sense.
259099110915850240,Fri Oct 19 01:10:16 +0000 2012,I have to shave my beard for work. There goes being The Dude for Halloween.
258849292926713860,Thu Oct 18 08:37:35 +0000 2012,10/17. The Others. Saw is in the theater several times. I was young at the time but still...yikes.
258608947768983550,Wed Oct 17 16:42:32 +0000 2012,Playing a surprise last minute show TONIGHT! for CMJ fest NYC at Rockwood Music Hall Stage 2. 9:30 pm. No cover.
258409211938107400,Wed Oct 17 03:28:51 +0000 2012,10/16. The Changeling. Still scary. Has to be one of the best haunted house movies ever. Not to be confused with Clint's film Changeling.
258331616643006460,Tue Oct 16 22:20:31 +0000 2012,@francesca_homes Fear not! I've given away nothing that can't be found in the trailers/comics.
258062800226766850,Tue Oct 16 04:32:20 +0000 2012,10/15. Psycho. Needs no explanation really.
257732268020350980,Mon Oct 15 06:38:55 +0000 2012,10/14. Insidious. Despite a slightly shakey finale I found this to be one of the creepier new original scary movies of the last few years.
257732268020350980,Mon Oct 15 06:38:55 +0000 2012,10/14. Insidious. Despite a slightly shakey finale I found this to be one of the creepier new original scary movies of the last few years.

257589332163059700,Sun Oct 14 21:10:57 +0000 2012,My rage passed. No shanking. I only "Baned" him across my knee but it's fine. Tom Conti will fix his back, he'll rise &amp; save Gotham. Wait...
257578816631865340,Sun Oct 14 20:29:10 +0000 2012,Oh so this guy in the Amtrak train quiet car WANTS to get shanked by me.

257199903854436350,Sat Oct 13 19:23:30 +0000 2012,Super agro meathead roid rager bullies at gyms; I'm sorry for whatever trauma you incurred that made you such insufferable jagweeds.
257155188358537200,Sat Oct 13 16:25:49 +0000 2012,You ever like get up early on a Saturday to go to the gym and a trainer there is like "you have toothpaste in your mustache"?
256980503444459520,Sat Oct 13 04:51:41 +0000 2012,10/12. Paranormal Activity. Haters gonna hate on the slow pace &amp; found footage style but I definitely had trouble sleeping after I saw it.
256848758334160900,Fri Oct 12 20:08:10 +0000 2012,With three dollar Guinness, good songs on the jukebox and Withnail and I on the television it is very hard to leave the bar.
256799332223836160,Fri Oct 12 16:51:46 +0000 2012,So many thanks to my AMAZING guests at Rockwood last night! @thecatapult @prouddragonfly @JJoshua_Johnson

256574115178229760,Fri Oct 12 01:56:50 +0000 2012,10/11. 28 Days Later. The tagline said "Danny Boyle reinvents zombie horror." The tagline was right.
256433676047495170,Thu Oct 11 16:38:47 +0000 2012,The third annual John Prine-a-Thon is tonight! Rockwood Music Hall Stage 2. 11:30 pm. Celebrate the mans b-day w/ me &amp; a few special guests!
256271599706177540,Thu Oct 11 05:54:45 +0000 2012,10/10. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You simply can't mess with this totally original piece of pulp grindhouse horrorshow.
255842879300329470,Wed Oct 10 01:31:10 +0000 2012,10/9. The Thing. One of John Carpenter's finest and easily one of the greatest remakes of all time in any genre. Great creature effects.
255505485619413000,Tue Oct 09 03:10:29 +0000 2012,10/8. Eden Lake. Relentless British horror. Fassbender vs. hooligans. 1 of the most upsetting endings since Night of the Living Dead.
255465457165934600,Tue Oct 09 00:31:25 +0000 2012,In honor of the great John Prine's birthday this week I'll be playing a free set of his songs at Rockwood Music Hall 2 this Thurs, 11:30 pm.
255355758093426700,Mon Oct 08 17:15:31 +0000 2012,Fall in New York City! The season that is. I'm not ordering you to lose your balance while you are in Manhattan. Just wanted to clarify.
255163846648549380,Mon Oct 08 04:32:56 +0000 2012,10/7. The Descent. Just when you thought it was safe to go spelunking! UK indie proves once again that good makeup is scarier than CGI.
254732876631904260,Sun Oct 07 00:00:25 +0000 2012,Honorable mentions; David Naughton, Griffin Dunne, Rick Baker, Frank Oz and the beautiful Jenny Agutter. All brilliant contributors.
254732007421132800,Sat Oct 06 23:56:57 +0000 2012,10/6. An American Werewolf In London. John Landis gave us one of the best (if not the greatest) horror/humor blends in cinematic history.
254729549798072320,Sat Oct 06 23:47:11 +0000 2012,Whole Love by Wilco on repeat all day all night all day all night.
254405230505107460,Sat Oct 06 02:18:28 +0000 2012,I got the "that's a wrap" blues.
254356591653031940,Fri Oct 05 23:05:11 +0000 2012,10/5. Poltergeist. This Hooper/Spielberg gem is on my mind 'cause I was near the Freeling house while at work in Simi Valley yesterday.
254281882408198140,Fri Oct 05 18:08:19 +0000 2012,10/4. Night of the Living Dead. Sure there had been zombie movies before it but none quite like this game changer from George A. Romero.
254266407393583100,Fri Oct 05 17:06:50 +0000 2012,Sorry I didn't give an October 4th scary movie recommendation yesterday. Long day at work. I'll do two today to make up for it.
253791358056267780,Thu Oct 04 09:39:09 +0000 2012,Know what movie I didn't see? Prometheus. And also like a thousand other movies.
253776661638692860,Thu Oct 04 08:40:45 +0000 2012,Sometimes autocorrect changes your its to it's. Sometimes you don't care enough to fix it.

20518182576,Sat Aug 07 02:26:12 +0000 2010,Jay-Z is going to publish his memoir. That'll be a serious tell all. I'm glad he didn't pull a Bieber and release it when he was a teenager.
20434378676,Fri Aug 06 02:46:36 +0000 2010,Everyone must read this book. It should be taught in schools. http://twitpic.com/2bzccz
20405608232,Thu Aug 05 17:54:14 +0000 2010,My 1st show at Rockwood Music Hall's stage 2 is this Sunday night at 8. 21+ No cover. It's bigger than stage 1. Let's pack 'em in!
20273153815,Wed Aug 04 03:05:54 +0000 2010,Since a few have asked, I am all better and back in AI as of last night and therefore have no excuse for watching all of the Elm Streets.
20270822437,Wed Aug 04 02:30:54 +0000 2010,My mother is totally "cell phone in the air at a concert" dialing me from the Green Day show in Camden!
20244530177,Tue Aug 03 19:26:06 +0000 2010,One step closer to finishing the Elm Street series. Watched part 5: The Dream Child. I now can't decide which sequel makes less sense.
20028659759,Sun Aug 01 00:35:40 +0000 2010,And you will not once hear me talk ill or slanderously about any of my brilliant castmates.
20028436366,Sun Aug 01 00:31:31 +0000 2010,And I would never suggest that the quality of our show would suffer merely because of my absence. It is worlds bigger than any one person.
20028239147,Sun Aug 01 00:27:59 +0000 2010,American Idiot has the most talented group of swings/understudies I have ever seen in my life and they never ever fail to deliver.
20026471854,Sat Jul 31 23:55:35 +0000 2010,My apology was being offered from a performer who purely hates to not be onstage at his job. No disrespect meant to the amazing AI cast.
20008558410,Sat Jul 31 17:58:01 +0000 2010,I got shut down and bed ridden by sickness this weekend. My true apologies to all seeing American Idiot. It is killing me to not be there.
19853884623,Thu Jul 29 20:47:16 +0000 2010,Confession: I also own The Stand DVD. I've always had a soft spot for the King miniseries.
19851223463,Thu Jul 29 19:59:36 +0000 2010,Finally finished Stephen King's The Stand. 1,159 pages. Longest book I've read. It is amazing. So unapologatically epic. Bold and brave.
19684056152,Tue Jul 27 20:30:42 +0000 2010,The panel I did for the American Theater Wing last month is now available to stream and download. http://tinyurl.com/35oqz42
19627736978,Tue Jul 27 03:53:28 +0000 2010,My show at Rockwood Stage 2 Sunday August 8th is at 8 PM not 8:30. Hope to see you all there!

19389314474,Sat Jul 24 02:52:09 +0000 2010,That was some storm! Huge thunderclap audible in the theater during Last Night on Earth. Very moody indeed!
19288719468,Thu Jul 22 22:31:03 +0000 2010,Van Hughes and I just saw Keanu Reeves hail a cab on 49th street. He's sporting a pretty groovy beard currently. Keanu that is. Not Van.
19286706199,Thu Jul 22 21:58:09 +0000 2010,@hitRECordJoe is definitely the most bad ass thing on screen in Inception. Apparently no stunt double for the hallway fight scene!
19222315555,Thu Jul 22 03:01:48 +0000 2010,All of the new cast members in American Idiot are fearlessly killing it on the St. James stage!
19026805294,Tue Jul 20 22:21:24 +0000 2010,Also totally worth checking Inception out in IMAX. Visually and aurally thrilling.
19026519741,Tue Jul 20 22:16:38 +0000 2010,LOVED Inception. Wildly inventive filmmaking. Great cast. I was transfixed. Definitely gonna need a repeated viewing. Sufficiently mindblown
19013032610,Tue Jul 20 18:17:01 +0000 2010,Inception IMAX! Here we go. So psyched but if the people around me keep up their current level of talking there will be hell to pay.
18943547409,Mon Jul 19 21:09:01 +0000 2010,Thank you to Ars Nova for having me and to everyone who came out to the show last night. It meant a great deal to me.
18817127374,Sun Jul 18 05:01:29 +0000 2010,I had an amazing cab driver tonight. He gave me a history lesson about a building almost every 5 blocks or so on the way to Brooklyn.
18816793175,Sun Jul 18 04:55:46 +0000 2010,Forgive me. Scottsboro Boys...with two t's.
18813069382,Sun Jul 18 03:52:20 +0000 2010,And you must all go see him star in the Scotsboro Boys on Broadway this fall!
18812756939,Sun Jul 18 03:47:06 +0000 2010,Joshua Henry's last performance in American Idiot was tonight. He is a touched and talented soul and performer and he will be so missed.
18789751877,Sat Jul 17 20:29:47 +0000 2010,My benefit show at Ars Nova is sold out tomorrow! Thanks to all for supporting the theater and independent arts. Looking forward to it!
18773317475,Sat Jul 17 15:30:31 +0000 2010,Only a couple of tickets left for my show at Ars Nova tomorrow night. Get 'em while they last!
18734054919,Sat Jul 17 02:26:03 +0000 2010,Holy cow I need to see Inception. 1 of my fav modern filmmakers & Joe G Levitt and Cillian Murphy are 2 of the best new gen superfilmstars.
18718120419,Fri Jul 16 21:52:05 +0000 2010,Keep this on your radar. It is a MUST SEE production. Co-conceived and directed by the brilliant Steven Hoggett. http://tinyurl.com/2vx5tzd
18715861891,Fri Jul 16 21:08:56 +0000 2010,I just napped it out like a champ. I want to be well rested for the 100th performance of American Idiot on Broadway tonight!
18685091788,Fri Jul 16 13:23:43 +0000 2010,That was so much fun! What a crowd! Thanks for getting up so early to come be with us this morning. You're all beautiful and you spoiled us.
18651853479,Fri Jul 16 02:41:02 +0000 2010,Thanks all for reminding me about the Borders near MSG. It's my closest option unless I need a play then it's Drama Book Shop (which rocks).
18651386599,Fri Jul 16 02:33:46 +0000 2010,@jaredgeller Perhaps "supposed epicenter" would have been a more apt reference. Yeah that's more like it!
18636904325,Thu Jul 15 22:43:57 +0000 2010,Ahhh Times Square. The epicenter of the East Coast yet not a single bookstore to be found.
18636199272,Thu Jul 15 22:32:09 +0000 2010,And Brian Helgeland cuts his teeth writing scripts for horror franchise films. Death scenes get weirder and more unneccessarily creative.
18636008983,Thu Jul 15 22:29:04 +0000 2010,Part 4. Patricia Arquette replaced by Tuesday Knight who also sings credits song. Renny Harlin helms. Plot has holes. Freddy makes puns.
18635790231,Thu Jul 15 22:25:23 +0000 2010,Remember when I said I was gonna watch all the NightmaresOnElmStreet and then stopped? Just started up again.
18634322221,Thu Jul 15 22:00:37 +0000 2010,And if you can't make it to the performance in NY tomorrow morning it will be broadcast live on Good Morning America on ABC 7-9 am.

18551414955,Wed Jul 14 21:58:26 +0000 2010,I just saw a dog go after a mailman. So it's true.
18381995786,Mon Jul 12 21:03:32 +0000 2010,My gig@Ars Nova is less than a week away! Fran Sancisco feat. Chase & Brian opens, Theo Stockman DJs afterparty. http://tinyurl.com/2vpkyn6
18226332912,Sat Jul 10 22:13:19 +0000 2010,I just had to stop myself from eating at the new Shake Shack on 8th. Too filling before the show. Immensely difficult to say no. Tempted.
18142593652,Fri Jul 09 19:36:02 +0000 2010,Just got laughed at by a woman who works at Home Depot for having trouble steering a big cart.
18137688292,Fri Jul 09 18:12:01 +0000 2010,The cast of American Idiot is going to be on Good Morning America next Fri July 16. Tune in to ABC or come watch live in Central Park.
18001585264,Thu Jul 08 02:41:19 +0000 2010,In the book Protest Singer there is a part where Pete Seeger's wife says he needs to eat breakfast and he says "I had a cookie." Awesome.
17901281507,Tue Jul 06 22:37:15 +0000 2010,Tix are going fast for my show at Ars Nova on July 18th. It's a benefit for the theater. Fran Sancisco, me, after party, open bar.
17884375642,Tue Jul 06 17:50:49 +0000 2010,Holy heat wave Batman! My window unit AC picked the most inopportune time to kick the bucket yesterday.
17746339802,Sun Jul 04 21:53:58 +0000 2010,Just watch the fireworks.
17463872147,Thu Jul 01 03:24:19 +0000 2010,I'm doing a benefit show for my friends@Ars Nova Theater on Sun, July 18th! http://tinyurl.com/2vpkyn6

16981800218,Fri Jun 25 02:46:28 +0000 2010,I did my very first ever remote interview using a monitor, a camera, a lapel mic and an earpiece. Next up, Meet the Press...(not really)

16870103626,Wed Jun 23 19:01:56 +0000 2010,Thanks kindly to all for my birthday wishes last week. A Dairy Queen commercial informed me that I'm one year older than the blizzard.
16869309556,Wed Jun 23 18:48:19 +0000 2010,The finale of Treme left me speechless. Beautifully articulated and honestly captured. An important American TV series. Bring on season 2!
16646163741,Sun Jun 20 21:32:46 +0000 2010,Happy Fathers Day Pops!
16355852644,Thu Jun 17 02:34:40 +0000 2010,A film I'm in called Jonah Hex hits theaters Friday. If you're planning on seeing it, why not check it out opening weekend! Eh?!
16272113944,Wed Jun 16 02:00:10 +0000 2010,And having said that, theater award season is over! May we all continue to run our shows with commitment and passion 8 times a week.
16271607216,Wed Jun 16 01:52:39 +0000 2010,Big ole congrats to Kevin Adams & Christine Jones. Equally beautiful as artists and humans. Kudos to Kevin for the "extra honest" speech.

15646833515,Mon Jun 07 18:12:27 +0000 2010,No day off! No mercy! Come see American Idiot tonight. We're one of the few B'way shows with a Monday night performance this week.

14806157126,Thu May 27 02:31:23 +0000 2010,Happy Birthday Levon!
14737083747,Wed May 26 03:09:04 +0000 2010,Didn't mean to be ill spirited or overly serious about award season by using the word justice. Just real excited for my friend. That's all.
