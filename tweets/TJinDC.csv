606218160837152800,Wed Jun 03 21:57:27 +0000 2015,@TPCarney Glad to hear! How do you propose to keep US energy cos competitive w/o #ExIm when ECA backing is a tender req't, as is typical?
606216621020037100,Wed Jun 03 21:51:20 +0000 2015,@TPCarney I'd think you'd be in favor of enabling US energy exports across the board, given their help to US interests.
606211480296517600,Wed Jun 03 21:30:54 +0000 2015,@veroderugy Taking you seriously as an economist, I'm sorry that you can't admit that your model omits a significant grp of beneficiaries.
606208737339142100,Wed Jun 03 21:20:00 +0000 2015,@veroderugy Why is this Q so hard for an economist to answer?
606208542245290000,Wed Jun 03 21:19:13 +0000 2015,@veroderugy So pls answer: how is  #ExIm is a subsidy that merely shifts resources, when that model ignores a whole group of beneficiaries?
606207571171639300,Wed Jun 03 21:15:22 +0000 2015,@veroderugy Would love for you to answer how $billions of nuclear exports - #ExIm qualified but not #ExIm financed - pose a taxpayer risk.

606206723913875500,Wed Jun 03 21:12:00 +0000 2015,@veroderugy How is a taxpayer on the hook for $8B reactor sale to China which #ExIm enabled but never financed?
606206295780270100,Wed Jun 03 21:10:18 +0000 2015,@veroderugy You claim that #ExIm is a subsidy that merely shifts resources around. But that model ignores a whole category of beneficiary.
606205357401206800,Wed Jun 03 21:06:34 +0000 2015,@veroderugy Irresponsible not to even attempt quantification of exports needing an ECA in the tender process. No "victim" if no #ExIm auth.
606204035616632800,Wed Jun 03 21:01:19 +0000 2015,@veroderugy Bottom line is, you're ignoring a massive #ExIm benefit from qualifying US exporters on tenders, where #ExIm costs are zero.
606202751375261700,Wed Jun 03 20:56:13 +0000 2015,@veroderugy These benefits -- resulting from int'l bus practices - aren't in your model that predicts a subsidy merely shifts $$$ around.
606201957724917800,Wed Jun 03 20:53:04 +0000 2015,@veroderugy E.g., @WECNuclear sold China 4 nuclear plants valued at $8B. #ExIm backing was a tender req't but ultimately was not used.

388130095002427400,Thu Oct 10 02:33:20 +0000 2013,The reason this matters: US nuclear coop &amp; supply supports US influence &amp; higher nonpro stds. @ArmsControlWonk @ElaineMGrossman
388094124064509950,Thu Oct 10 00:10:24 +0000 2013,Depends on context. If talking abt nonpro issues in a 123, misleading to ignore nonpro benefits and call it mere trade pact @ArmsControlWonk
388091810490613760,Thu Oct 10 00:01:12 +0000 2013,Also misleading: the US does not auth transfer of "sensitive tech" to countries that don't have them, regardless of 123. @ElaineMGrossman
