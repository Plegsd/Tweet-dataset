746155793389498400,Fri Jun 24 01:39:38 +0000 2016,@r0unak @skupor I agree. The question is who do you want to own the company? People must be paid for work done. No question. Cash or stock?
746118812622196700,Thu Jun 23 23:12:41 +0000 2016,@birsic I think we need transparent plans that reflect the desired incentive structure rather than a hack on a bad plan.
746118480290734100,Thu Jun 23 23:11:22 +0000 2016,@harryh I agree, but it's false to say that e.g. 0.2% of co. with a 90 day exercise is = 0.2% with a 10 yr one. Need a redesign not a hack.

746100289422262300,Thu Jun 23 21:59:05 +0000 2016,@boucher I agree with that. I just think the answer has to be more comprehensive.
746100120991653900,Thu Jun 23 21:58:25 +0000 2016,@boucher Yes, but if company A has 90 day exercise and company B has 10 year exercise then 0.1% of company A &gt; 0.1% of company B.

746095856395247600,Thu Jun 23 21:41:28 +0000 2016,@boucher @buzz 3/Conclusion is that if you are going to redesign the system, you need to redesign the whole system not just a piece.

746080663623786500,Thu Jun 23 20:41:06 +0000 2016,@birsic That's part of the question. $$ in pocket should not matter, but long-term ownership incentive might be better if it's long-term.
746078786270044200,Thu Jun 23 20:33:38 +0000 2016,@birsic That depends on the agreement. The question is how long should you have to work somewhere to become an owner? 1 year? 1 week?
