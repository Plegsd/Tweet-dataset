767491885548052500,Sun Aug 21 22:41:39 +0000 2016,@StephenPiment My core point is just that demand isn't fixed -- and with positive returns to marginal scale, dynamics might surprise.

724720297090273300,Mon Apr 25 22:02:38 +0000 2016,@shaft Central was a friend and former colleague being absolutely adamant that we should hire.
724720126675685400,Mon Apr 25 22:01:57 +0000 2016,@shaft If it doesn't, we'll adjust or stop.
724720015560183800,Mon Apr 25 22:01:31 +0000 2016,@shaft More broadly, since it seems it *could* help, we wanted to try it. I hate the ratio of talk to action in industry.
724719866452709400,Mon Apr 25 22:00:55 +0000 2016,@shaft Groups already migrate from company to company. We want to make sure we get *everyone*, not just those who look like what we expect.
724719143493062700,Mon Apr 25 21:58:03 +0000 2016,@shaft This is how we hired our first woman in eng -- an econ major who had only been programming for a year or two. And she was amazing!
724718957081456600,Mon Apr 25 21:57:18 +0000 2016,@shaft Because people can say "I know this person has unusual background but they're *awesome*!"
724718507141648400,Mon Apr 25 21:55:31 +0000 2016,@shaft Regardless, will absolutely be running program with this question (and goal) in mind.
724718357467930600,Mon Apr 25 21:54:55 +0000 2016,@shaft Part of idea's genesis was noticing that some of people from most unusual backgrounds at Stripe were hired as part of teams like this
724718044052750300,Mon Apr 25 21:53:40 +0000 2016,@shaft Goal is to better identify undervalued/underrepresented talent by not just applying traditional SV interview standards.
724714540089253900,Mon Apr 25 21:39:45 +0000 2016,@sean_a_rose Yeah, hard to know for sure. But given that it could work/help, we wanted to try it. We'll pay close attention to this.
724714115302748200,Mon Apr 25 21:38:04 +0000 2016,@sarahmei On contrary, we don't want to restrict team hiring to the set of founders with access to capital. Others deserve it too!
724713112767602700,Mon Apr 25 21:34:05 +0000 2016,@sean_a_rose Regardless, the standard SV approach empirically does not work well. So we want to start trying things and not just talking.
724712704213012500,Mon Apr 25 21:32:27 +0000 2016,@sean_a_rose And to overcome some of their associated structural biases. We'll monitor the results closely, though.
724712442882744300,Mon Apr 25 21:31:25 +0000 2016,@sean_a_rose First woman we hired in eng was part of a team like this. Our hope is that this is a way to get past traditional SV interviews.
724711785845018600,Mon Apr 25 21:28:48 +0000 2016,@tqbf Correct, that's the intent.
724711596769964000,Mon Apr 25 21:28:03 +0000 2016,@tqbf But it's what we're trying to avoid.
724711545062592500,Mon Apr 25 21:27:51 +0000 2016,@tqbf Hiring is complicated (as you know, I think :)), so I can't say that what you describe will categorically never happen.
724711244431642600,Mon Apr 25 21:26:39 +0000 2016,@tqbf The whole motivation behind making the commitment pass/fail is to avoid trying to split teams -- we don't like being in that position.
724710133167587300,Mon Apr 25 21:22:14 +0000 2016,@ninavizz @hunterwalk We will monitor the results closely! It's at least clear that the standard approaches don't work so well.
724709579632705500,Mon Apr 25 21:20:02 +0000 2016,@ninavizz @jess @stripe @avibryant On contrary, I hope this moves us past traditional SV interviews &amp; helps us overcome some of its biases.
724707956890042400,Mon Apr 25 21:13:36 +0000 2016,@hunterwalk And, more broadly, I hope that this is a way to help us move beyond the traditional SV interview process.
724707607336775700,Mon Apr 25 21:12:12 +0000 2016,@hunterwalk My hope is that it helps. The first woman in engineering at Stripe was part of a two-person team we hired.

703326175905579000,Fri Feb 26 21:10:02 +0000 2016,@ezraklein Yes, for sure. Though anyone taking *that* out (hasn't but will) generally ends up proving too much, IMO.
