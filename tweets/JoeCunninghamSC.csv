925425738009980900,Tue Oct 31 18:14:24 +0000 2017,Final: There are more indictments coming out of DC and Columbia than good ideas these days. It’s time to overhaul the system that allows it.
925425412754227200,Tue Oct 31 18:13:06 +0000 2017,10. Ban fundraising while Congress is in session. Members should be working while in DC. Instead of fundraisers, spend time reading bills.
925425036433002500,Tue Oct 31 18:11:36 +0000 2017,9. Ban roll-over campaign dollars. Require fed candidates to zero-out their campaign accounts after each cycle. If unopposed, must return $.
925424775706669000,Tue Oct 31 18:10:34 +0000 2017,8. One person, one pension. Ban politicians from double dipping and receiving multiple pensions at one time for separate political offices.
925424627651932200,Tue Oct 31 18:09:59 +0000 2017,7. Real-time campaign account monitoring. Candidates use central bank for campaign accts so public can view donations/spending in real time.
925424356188213200,Tue Oct 31 18:08:54 +0000 2017,6. Close the revolving door. Increase the wait period for former members of Congress to become lobbyists from 1 year to 5 years.
925424232686813200,Tue Oct 31 18:08:25 +0000 2017,5. Pass the DISCLOSE Act. Close loopholes by requiring full disclosure for special interests who hide behind Super PACs.
925423610097029100,Tue Oct 31 18:05:56 +0000 2017,4. Automatic voter registration. Corruption feeds off of apathy. Voters should be automatically registered on their 18th birthday.
925423423945433100,Tue Oct 31 18:05:12 +0000 2017,3. End gerrymandering. Create indep. commissions to draw district lines. Voters should pick their politicians, not the other way around.
925423188917579800,Tue Oct 31 18:04:16 +0000 2017,2. Ban PAC contributions. It’s time to weaken the overwhelming political power of special interests.
925423032268677100,Tue Oct 31 18:03:39 +0000 2017,1. Term limits for all members of Congress. 3 terms for House, 2 terms for Senate. No more career politicians.
