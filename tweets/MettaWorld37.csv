373109474958905340,Thu Aug 29 15:46:45 +0000 2013,üí° I canceled my documentary   I decided to do a soap opera   It's a passionate song about how much soap stings when it's in my eyes

372936328477802500,Thu Aug 29 04:18:44 +0000 2013,üë§ This symbol means I have an confession. Ok?
372932195314180100,Thu Aug 29 04:02:18 +0000 2013,So the moral of this story is , when I walk into your store, it's a price tag check fool. 4 reel doe
372931828073496600,Thu Aug 29 04:00:51 +0000 2013,So basically dude thought twerking was going to scare me. He started twerking. I'm like"Keep ur price tags. I'm out" it worked.
372921427760275460,Thu Aug 29 03:19:31 +0000 2013,But there's more
372921402477019140,Thu Aug 29 03:19:25 +0000 2013,He flipped out! "U want a charger , then stick the price tags back on the items. " I'm like " he'll no, I don't even know where to put them"
372921088763654140,Thu Aug 29 03:18:10 +0000 2013,So now we are text arguing. But my phone was running out of battery and I asked him "you got an iPhone 2 charger Habibi "
372920836967383040,Thu Aug 29 03:17:10 +0000 2013,He got mad at me because I was asking him how much is the salad by the pound.   He could really talk wit one tooth. So I had him text me
372920622784864260,Thu Aug 29 03:16:19 +0000 2013,So me and the store owner were arguing. He had one tooth and I had price tags stuck to my hand. Like 65 price tags.   I also tested food
372920261571805200,Thu Aug 29 03:14:53 +0000 2013,"What you think, I can't guess the price. I can guess. That's racist man. You gonna put the price on the items because I'm black"
372920058248691700,Thu Aug 29 03:14:05 +0000 2013,I felt that prices being on items were his way of saying "dumb boy , here is the price" I ripped off all the price tags. I was like
372919806711722000,Thu Aug 29 03:13:05 +0000 2013,I told the store owner he was bias because his sign was only for black people. I was also annoyed that prices were on items!!
372919065284603900,Thu Aug 29 03:10:08 +0000 2013,So the store was telling me what to do like , please do not lean on the glass.   I was offended so I elbowed it and broke the glass. Then..
