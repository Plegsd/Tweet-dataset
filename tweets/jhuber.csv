312328234878513150,Thu Mar 14 22:23:48 +0000 2013,@kevinmarks You're eating ear wax.
312328082218434560,Thu Mar 14 22:23:12 +0000 2013,@shellen Jason -- @NickelodeonUSA beat you to it. Ever seen CatDog? http://t.co/RENFrGdFsz
312325599052046340,Thu Mar 14 22:13:20 +0000 2013,@fromedome -- Hmm, an undersea vactrain (http://t.co/JRhjgTPsYq) could do NY-Paris in &lt;2 hrs at ~mach 5 with non-crazy accel/decel.
312323841147936800,Thu Mar 14 22:06:21 +0000 2013,@aunkurarya Thanks, Aunkur! And thanks for your good work at AdMob/Google. I hope things are going well for you and @braintree
312323271020380160,Thu Mar 14 22:04:05 +0000 2013,@shellen Solid state power management could change a lot of things there.
312322756643528700,Thu Mar 14 22:02:02 +0000 2013,@rfradin Really hard -- the bond between previews and movies is too great and exceeds strong-nuclear force.
312321851776970750,Thu Mar 14 21:58:26 +0000 2013,@shellen Thanks, Jason! That's an interesting area, and should happen soon with wearable computing.
312321546372931600,Thu Mar 14 21:57:13 +0000 2013,@tombielecki ... with precise location and proximity (smartphones, Glass), it's imminently do-able.
312321303896014850,Thu Mar 14 21:56:16 +0000 2013,@benjy That is an interesting area. @HughHerr and team at MIT are doing some amazing work in 'biomechatronics'.
312314609958797300,Thu Mar 14 21:29:40 +0000 2013,@tombielecki Agreed, and should be possible (StreetView is v1.0). With Glass, you could also get all the sidewalks, paths, and indoors.
312314173470154750,Thu Mar 14 21:27:56 +0000 2013,@Jasonsoll Jason -- that's great, I'll look forward to meeting you.
312313858968678400,Thu Mar 14 21:26:41 +0000 2013,@benjy Thanks, Benjy! We looked into self-untangling ear bud technology, and it's still at least 20 years away.
312313353232064500,Thu Mar 14 21:24:40 +0000 2013,@localseoguide Right now it's 'external mount' with Glass. The next version...
312313167449579500,Thu Mar 14 21:23:56 +0000 2013,@jsalsman Thanks, James. I wasn't aware of  CAS -- and seems like it could address cryopreservation toxicity issues.
312311998035681300,Thu Mar 14 21:19:17 +0000 2013,@curtispokrant Thanks, Curtis! Hmm, we have Zavers to get that rolling -- http://t.co/Gk0kNe2Pbj

312268348626960400,Thu Mar 14 18:25:50 +0000 2013,@kirtan Thinking about it. The first prototype was too conventional and would have taken too long to get to the Google Space Station.
