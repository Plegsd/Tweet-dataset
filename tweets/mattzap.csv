873255815662141400,Fri Jun 09 19:09:45 +0000 2017,Trump adds later: "Frankly James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren’t true."
873255581204852700,Fri Jun 09 19:08:49 +0000 2017,"No collusion, no obstruction, he’s a leaker, but we want to get back to running our great country." --Trump's response to Comey testimony.

872851203847315500,Thu Jun 08 16:21:58 +0000 2017,Says he didn't because, "I knew there was no case there." Feared people would interpret his call otherwise.
872851086146752500,Thu Jun 08 16:21:30 +0000 2017,After tarmac meeting, Comey says, "I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel."
872850893154250800,Thu Jun 08 16:20:44 +0000 2017,Back on Clinton email, Comey says of Lynch: "I didn’t believe she could credibly decline that investigation."
872845168260599800,Thu Jun 08 15:57:59 +0000 2017,Comey to Trump: "Release all the tapes. I’m good with it."
872845001067290600,Thu Jun 08 15:57:19 +0000 2017,"That gave me a queasy feeling," Comey says.
872844941206138900,Thu Jun 08 15:57:05 +0000 2017,"It gave the impression that the attorney general was looking to align the way we talked about our work" with the campaign talking point..
872844738940084200,Thu Jun 08 15:56:17 +0000 2017,"That concerned me, because that language tracked the way the campaign was talking about the FBI's work, and that’s concerning."
872844634468171800,Thu Jun 08 15:55:52 +0000 2017,Comey says when Lynch asked him to call Clinton case a matter, not investigation, that concerned him b/c language lined up w/ campaign's!
872844355077369900,Thu Jun 08 15:54:45 +0000 2017,Yikes. Comey is coming after Trump, but he saved a few bullets for Loretta Lynch...
872842591062175700,Thu Jun 08 15:47:44 +0000 2017,Comey said he turned over notes to Bob Mueller's office. But his designated leaker might still have a copy.
872838454882836500,Thu Jun 08 15:31:18 +0000 2017,"That to me, as an investigator, is a very significant fact," Comey says.
872838332920811500,Thu Jun 08 15:30:49 +0000 2017,Comey laying out obstruction case. "So why did he kick everybody out of the oval office?"
872837562704044000,Thu Jun 08 15:27:46 +0000 2017,Comey plays the game. https://t.co/E8u3EAdFAU
872837023773675500,Thu Jun 08 15:25:37 +0000 2017,Comey was answering a question on why he didn't raise issue with White House. He seems to be indicating FBI was contemplating obstruction.
872836783138111500,Thu Jun 08 15:24:40 +0000 2017,Comey, on Trump's Flynn request: "It was of investigative interest to us to try and figure out what just happened." Yikes.
872829382825578500,Thu Jun 08 14:55:15 +0000 2017,Comey tries to come back on it. "I took it as a direction. This is the president of the United States, with me alone, saying I hope this."
872829220770238500,Thu Jun 08 14:54:37 +0000 2017,The exchange:  Risch: "He did not direct you to let it go?" Comey: "Not in his words, no." Trump had said: "I hope you can let this go."
872828894285627400,Thu Jun 08 14:53:19 +0000 2017,Under questioning from Sen. Risch, Comey falters a little bit on allegation that Trump directed him to shut down Flynn probe.
872827512845463600,Thu Jun 08 14:47:50 +0000 2017,Comey says same of Kushner, who stood by Comey's chair and exchanged pleasantries with him before 1-on-1 Trump-Comey meeting
872827191708573700,Thu Jun 08 14:46:33 +0000 2017,“My sense was the attorney general knew he shouldn’t be leaving, which is why he was lingering," Comey says.
872827108522942500,Thu Jun 08 14:46:13 +0000 2017,Comey, on Feb. 14 meeting, says he suspects the AG knew it was wrong to leave Comey alone with Trump
872826420241870800,Thu Jun 08 14:43:29 +0000 2017,Comey says his impression was Trump was "looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job."
872826014552002600,Thu Jun 08 14:41:52 +0000 2017,This person felt, according to Comey, "inevitably [Trump's] conduct will fall within the scope" of bureau's work
872825850349191200,Thu Jun 08 14:41:13 +0000 2017,Comey: At least 1 in FBI leadership didn't want to tell Trump he wasn't under investigation, because investigation was aimed at campaign...
872825150235869200,Thu Jun 08 14:38:26 +0000 2017,More Comey 🔥. Why did he document interactions with Trump? Comey was "concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting."
872824419219107800,Thu Jun 08 14:35:32 +0000 2017,Comey also says he was concerned that AG had asked him to call case a "matter," rather than an "investigation."
872824240596299800,Thu Jun 08 14:34:49 +0000 2017,“That was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately," he says of tarmac encounter.
872824170111012900,Thu Jun 08 14:34:33 +0000 2017,We're back on Clinton email. Comey says Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting is why he went solo to announce recommendation on not charging Clinton
872823114983505900,Thu Jun 08 14:30:21 +0000 2017,Comey won't draw legal conclusion on if Trump tried to obstruct justice but says of Trump request "I took it as a very disturbing thing."
872822723537514500,Thu Jun 08 14:28:48 +0000 2017,Comey says there was an "open FBI criminal investigation" of Flynn for statements he made about Russian contacts &amp; contacts themselves
872822507383947300,Thu Jun 08 14:27:56 +0000 2017,Another wow. Comey confirms: When Trump talked to him about Flynn, "General Flynn at that point in time was in legal jeopardy."
872822337053261800,Thu Jun 08 14:27:16 +0000 2017,But, keep in mind, Comey generously interprets Trump's pressure as being Flynn specific -- not applying to broad Russia investigation
872822026821677000,Thu Jun 08 14:26:02 +0000 2017,Comey answers pretty unequivocally that president did not ask him to stop probe of Russian involvement in 2016 election
872821520942366700,Thu Jun 08 14:24:01 +0000 2017,To FBI he left behind, Comey declares, "I am so sorry that I didn’t get the chance to say good bye to you properly."
872821367628079100,Thu Jun 08 14:23:24 +0000 2017,Comey is particularly mad about administration's characterization of FBI as being in disarray. “Those were lies, plain and simple," he says.
872821089386287100,Thu Jun 08 14:22:18 +0000 2017,Wow. Comey coming after the White House. Says administration chose "to defame me, and more importantly, the FBI."
872820734929850400,Thu Jun 08 14:20:54 +0000 2017,Comey says shifting explanations on his firing "confused me and increasingly concerned me”
872820555786985500,Thu Jun 08 14:20:11 +0000 2017,Comey: "When I was appointed FBI director in 2013, I understood that I served at the pleasure of the president."
872820230376042500,Thu Jun 08 14:18:53 +0000 2017,Comey is now under oath.
872819151424847900,Thu Jun 08 14:14:36 +0000 2017,Warner, recounting what we already know, says Trump expressed an "odd and unexplained affection for the Russian dictator"
872818240333992000,Thu Jun 08 14:10:59 +0000 2017,Warner: "This investigation is not about re-litigating the election."
872817834879057900,Thu Jun 08 14:09:22 +0000 2017,Burr telegraphs a few lines of inquiry: One is on if Trump convos altered FBI's approach to investigation. Another is on Clinton email.
872817140994330600,Thu Jun 08 14:06:37 +0000 2017,Burr, to Comey: "Today’s your opportunity to set the record straight." Indeed!

872781461279166500,Thu Jun 08 11:44:50 +0000 2017,Their views might be even more important than Mueller's on that particular question.
872781318551220200,Thu Jun 08 11:44:16 +0000 2017,That, to me, makes this hearing even more important. Will Comey's testimony move any Republicans to thinking obstruction occurred?
872780992611856400,Thu Jun 08 11:42:58 +0000 2017,So if the case comes down to obstruction on the part of Trump, it would be up to Congressional Republicans to impeach
872780630597279700,Thu Jun 08 11:41:32 +0000 2017,That's b/c of this Justice Dept. opinion (&amp; another it cites) saying you can't indict/prosecute a sitting president https://t.co/05WZz0Kp3V
872780334412255200,Thu Jun 08 11:40:21 +0000 2017,So, if the president's wrongdoing is his alone, Mueller can't do anything in the criminal courts
872780082259144700,Thu Jun 08 11:39:21 +0000 2017,(Save maybe Flynn, for his convo with FBI agents in which he might not have told the truth. That could produce a false statements charge)
872779803493109800,Thu Jun 08 11:38:15 +0000 2017,But there's been no real evidence or allegation anyone aside from Trump himself attempted to obstruct justice...
872779356581634000,Thu Jun 08 11:36:28 +0000 2017,Here's what I mean by that. Mueller could certainly charge Flynn, Manafort, etc in the coordination case or even with financial crimes...

861677483254583300,Mon May 08 20:21:35 +0000 2017,Unless he's playing devil's advocate, Shedd is clearly on the government side here. Niemeyer seems that way, too.
861677306565328900,Mon May 08 20:20:53 +0000 2017,Now Shedd is pressing Jadwat on whose fault it is if president policy is blocked, and an attack happens.
861677071218749400,Mon May 08 20:19:57 +0000 2017,Shedd, on POTUS's motive for travel ban: "He thought that was in the interest of the country, at least part of it."

861675758619635700,Mon May 08 20:14:44 +0000 2017,I will say, government tried to clarify whether they could keep doing assessment, and the judge in Hawaii effectively told them to get lost.
861675592520958000,Mon May 08 20:14:05 +0000 2017,Jadwat says they don't. But he's ambiguous on whether Hawaii judge has stopped them from doing them.
861675446617993200,Mon May 08 20:13:30 +0000 2017,Now getting back to the issue I started this thread on. Wynn: "Do you have any problem with the government conducting these studies?"
861675086037876700,Mon May 08 20:12:04 +0000 2017,Jadwat: "It’s possible that saying sorry is not enough."
861674795045408800,Mon May 08 20:10:54 +0000 2017,Judge Shedd: "What if he said he’s sorry every day for a year?" My observation: That's DEFINITELY not happening.
861674534306533400,Mon May 08 20:09:52 +0000 2017,Jadwat: "Simple" repudiation probably not enough. My observation: It's also not happening.
861674387715620900,Mon May 08 20:09:17 +0000 2017,Judge King asks what if Trump repudiated statements. "What if he repudiated them all?"
861674046269907000,Mon May 08 20:07:56 +0000 2017,Jadwat: "It depends on how the vetting would operate in fact."
861673888421425200,Mon May 08 20:07:18 +0000 2017,Niemeyer follows up. What if govt imposes extreme vetting, would taint carry over to that?

861667839488528400,Mon May 08 19:43:16 +0000 2017,Jadwat is a little squirrelly on that point. He says there are logical problems with the order.
861667613449097200,Mon May 08 19:42:22 +0000 2017,But Niemeyer goes further: "Is the face of this order legitimate?"
861667403075342300,Mon May 08 19:41:32 +0000 2017,Jadwat: "I think in that case it could be constitutional."

861667014187905000,Mon May 08 19:39:59 +0000 2017,Jadwat: Question is basically, was president's primary purpose the animus, or was primary purpose to protect national security?
861666802715197400,Mon May 08 19:39:09 +0000 2017,Jadwat: "The animus is not permanently disqualifying for any circumstance."
861666528193904600,Mon May 08 19:38:03 +0000 2017,(In this example, which is hypothetical, everyone agrees the group is presenting a natsec problem.)
