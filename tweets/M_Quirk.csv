1688109876,Sun May 03 17:21:42 +0000 2009,I seem to have developed a flock of "cam-girl" followers.  I'm eating a popsicle, ladies, what do you think about that?

1675844066,Sat May 02 03:27:53 +0000 2009,WC Puppets = We're Called Puppets.  I really don't get that and not sure if I want to.

1675781190,Sat May 02 03:18:54 +0000 2009,...and that girl is rubbing a cock on her breast.  She is some British tabloid sensation from like 10 years ago (I clicked on the link).
1675771077,Sat May 02 03:17:29 +0000 2009,@JessiaSott Remarkably I know the answers to both of these!  The Hawks got their asses handed to them by the Miami Heat in hoops tonight.

1646594062,Wed Apr 29 05:41:54 +0000 2009,Unable to find my friend here tonight.  I wonder how this can be.  Also, feeling philosophical overload of my own doing.  Is this a problem?

1548984478,Sat Apr 18 05:37:42 +0000 2009,My back is sore.  I injured it playing basketball. I've never had a sore back before, but my assumption that it sucks was correct.
