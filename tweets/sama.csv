787835233521377300,Mon Oct 17 01:58:51 +0000 2016,9) Sometimes the hardest and most important thing is to sit down with a friend and try to teach instead of yelling.
787834793958322200,Mon Oct 17 01:57:06 +0000 2016,8) I don't ascribe all beliefs politicians hold to their supporters, although sometimes that really gets tested.

787834646461452300,Mon Oct 17 01:56:31 +0000 2016,6) Diversity of opinion is painful but critical to the health of a democratic society. We can't start purging people for political support.
787834522180079600,Mon Oct 17 01:56:02 +0000 2016,5) Cutting off opposing viewpoints leads to extremism and will not get us the country we want.
787834428064084000,Mon Oct 17 01:55:39 +0000 2016,4) We need to talk to each other more, not less.  Most people think roughly half the country is severely misguided.
787834386393632800,Mon Oct 17 01:55:29 +0000 2016,3.5) That's a dangerous path to start down.
787834278478422000,Mon Oct 17 01:55:03 +0000 2016,3) Thiel is a high profile supporter of Trump. I disagree with this. YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.
787834062291345400,Mon Oct 17 01:54:12 +0000 2016,2) I think he's absuvie, erratic, and prone to fits or rage. I think he is unfit to be President and would be a threat to national security.
787833953369464800,Mon Oct 17 01:53:46 +0000 2016,1) I am voting against Trump because I believe the principles he stands for represent an unacceptable threat to America.
787833897132232700,Mon Oct 17 01:53:32 +0000 2016,0/ Official YC post coming in the next couple of days, but to make my personal beliefs clear:
787796024777596900,Sun Oct 16 23:23:03 +0000 2016,@dhh @paulg he is not a partner. he is what we call a part-time partner, which shares a word but is legally totally different. no votes, etc
787794988855812100,Sun Oct 16 23:18:56 +0000 2016,@dhh @paulg they don't have to; no YC company ever has to book office hours with anyone they don't want to meet with.

787788785417236500,Sun Oct 16 22:54:17 +0000 2016,@Pinboard that we do take a stand against. i and almost every (maybe every?) partner think supporting trump is wrong.
787786486519259100,Sun Oct 16 22:45:09 +0000 2016,@brianshall @Pinboard yes, it's a joke to me. but i think he is actually advocating for it. i'd like to confirm before a post in publishing.
787782182542520300,Sun Oct 16 22:28:03 +0000 2016,@uuilly don't worry, we're obviously not going to. i just want to know if he actually thinks this is the right course of action.
787781575983247400,Sun Oct 16 22:25:38 +0000 2016,To make my own views on Trump clear, here is my post from early this summer. I feel even more strongly now.  https://t.co/6sPpIUZduT
787781076013883400,Sun Oct 16 22:23:39 +0000 2016,@chrstphr_ @Pinboard no of course not. but it'd be interesting and scary to me if the pinboard guy thinks that's the right thing to do.
787780640921890800,Sun Oct 16 22:21:55 +0000 2016,@Pinboard And since you seem confused about his role, part-time partner means he has no vote in how the YC partnership operates.
787780510898532400,Sun Oct 16 22:21:24 +0000 2016,.@Pinboard I'd like to hear what you think. Do you think we should fire Peter over his support of Trump?

714518755586408400,Mon Mar 28 18:25:21 +0000 2016,If you tie CEO comp to share price, and CEOs expect to be at a company for ~3 years, then you should not be surprised when:
714312051871494100,Mon Mar 28 04:43:59 +0000 2016,Best companies either set their valuation to something reasonable, or say "no" when investors say "I need it for my brand value".
714311773663309800,Mon Mar 28 04:42:52 +0000 2016,(Don't entirely agree with this, but it is generally true that the best YC companies don't hand out advisor shares to investors.)
714311568750563300,Mon Mar 28 04:42:03 +0000 2016,"You don't want advisor shares in any company that will agree to give them to you as part of your investment."

711659746458075100,Sun Mar 20 21:04:40 +0000 2016,.@lovepinkrose12 Totally yes. The problem has been that "biz skills" include negotiation, and so engineers were relatively underpaid.
711628772353515500,Sun Mar 20 19:01:35 +0000 2016,(Also, after years of every company saying "we pay 75th percentile engineering salaries", this is sort of what has to happen :) )

709520878233518100,Mon Mar 14 23:25:34 +0000 2016,@semil except for VR, that's nearly the list from my tweet. i think it'd be helpful to shorten to the diff (e.g. digital health, apple tv).
709519955323007000,Mon Mar 14 23:21:54 +0000 2016,6/ So you should always be willing to go back to investors with more progress and data, though at some point you won't need them!
709519790193254400,Mon Mar 14 23:21:14 +0000 2016,5/ Also, "this doesn't fit my investment criteria" usually means "I don't see this being a billion dollar company".
709518792787759100,Mon Mar 14 23:17:17 +0000 2016,4/ And best of all: "Which companies have you invested in that no one else seemed excited about?"
709518668946808800,Mon Mar 14 23:16:47 +0000 2016,3/ Instead, ask investor: "Which of your recent investments are you most excited about? Which companies do you wish you'd invested in?"
709518302574325800,Mon Mar 14 23:15:20 +0000 2016,2/ These are (obviously) not helpful for figuring out which investors to target.
709518175377817600,Mon Mar 14 23:14:49 +0000 2016,1/ Almost all seed investors give ~identical lists of what they're interested in--"I'm interested in SaaS, VR, IoT, and consumer mobile".
709516280772976600,Mon Mar 14 23:07:18 +0000 2016,.@tommyespinoza_ 1) world always changes 2) smart, determined people can out-compete "experienced" people in many industries (tho not all)
709479328422056000,Mon Mar 14 20:40:28 +0000 2016,(Though I think in most ways experience is significantly overrated.)
709479204119646200,Mon Mar 14 20:39:58 +0000 2016,One way experience is good: after 1,000 really bad things have happened, you're confident you'll get through the 1,001th.

669600807889838100,Wed Nov 25 19:37:27 +0000 2015,5/ People often ask me why YC performs as well as it does.  We are an equal partnership with 16 people making decisions about what we do,

669600608232558600,Wed Nov 25 19:36:40 +0000 2015,3/ One of the problems with the way the press covers business is that the CEO always gets far too much coverage and the rest of the team...
669600533238431700,Wed Nov 25 19:36:22 +0000 2015,2/ Near the top of the list are my partners and the whole team at YC.

667852581968805900,Fri Nov 20 23:50:38 +0000 2015,You have a problem, so you decide to raise some money. Now you have two problems. So you hire some people. Now you have three problems.
667851491705688000,Fri Nov 20 23:46:18 +0000 2015,I basically just get out my checkbook right then.
667851390568431600,Fri Nov 20 23:45:54 +0000 2015,One of my favorite things ever is when someone starts a meeting saying "I will do X, and here is how."
667851270586142700,Fri Nov 20 23:45:25 +0000 2015,A lot more people say "we should do X" than "I will do X" (where X= "solve climate change" "go to the moon" "work on income inequality" etc)

667800048558706700,Fri Nov 20 20:21:53 +0000 2015,@lhockenson I appreciate you being civil in this conversation, and I hope you'll take a close look at our diversity efforts. Going to mtg.
667799828244512800,Fri Nov 20 20:21:00 +0000 2015,@lhockenson Ok. I'm allowed to think what I want about your journalistic standards and you can think what you want about me.
667799425574551600,Fri Nov 20 20:19:24 +0000 2015,@lhockenson Another thing PG's essay has nothing to do with is the diversity of our founders.
667798958316458000,Fri Nov 20 20:17:33 +0000 2015,@lhockenson if, say, 35% of the batch were white males, would you count that s "predominant"?
667798840553017300,Fri Nov 20 20:17:05 +0000 2015,@lhockenson We also don't clarify Indian, Brazilian, or any of the other 40+ countries founders are from.
667798552635043800,Fri Nov 20 20:15:56 +0000 2015,.@lhockenson PG wrote a love letter to his wife and defender her against prospective attackers. It also had nothing to do with The Macro.
667798128003645400,Fri Nov 20 20:14:15 +0000 2015,@lhockenson (though perhaps it depends how rigorously you define "white"--what about half white half asian people, for ex?)
667797976979378200,Fri Nov 20 20:13:39 +0000 2015,@lhockenson yes, one of the many things i would have told you is that "predominantly white, male founder base" is incorrect.
667797409540390900,Fri Nov 20 20:11:24 +0000 2015,@lhockenson continuing to improve our funnel is one of my top priorities, as i think it's the right thing to do and will help our returns
667797172851621900,Fri Nov 20 20:10:27 +0000 2015,@lhockenson we are always open to ideas about how to get a more diverse set of applicants (though already significantly above industry avgs)
667796938268344300,Fri Nov 20 20:09:31 +0000 2015,@lhockenson i'd hope that you would, since we publish them.
667795235720724500,Fri Nov 20 20:02:45 +0000 2015,And I get that fighting with the press is stupid (and that they'll actually get some readers now), but if no one does, we're all worse off.
667794867376906200,Fri Nov 20 20:01:18 +0000 2015,We continue to work to get diverse YC applicants, and we fund women, Black and Latino founders at or slightly above the rate they apply.

660886410191175700,Sun Nov 01 18:29:33 +0000 2015,4/ If you take the time to become an expert in something and develop real conviction, it's ok to overallocate there.
660886206952042500,Sun Nov 01 18:28:45 +0000 2015,3/ Buying index funds is certainly a historically safe strategy, but it's not the only strategy.

655492483401449500,Sat Oct 17 21:16:01 +0000 2015,But the whole media pile-on to "extremely great!" or "extremely horrible!", without a rigorous review of facts, doesn't serve us well.

641283900929474600,Tue Sep 08 16:16:11 +0000 2015,7/ Also important: culture of engineers getting (significant) owernship in companies. Only way to get really rich is by owning something.
641283470971441200,Tue Sep 08 16:14:28 +0000 2015,6/ Closest historical precedent was the industrial revolution, but the big winners there seem to mostly be business first and tech second.

641282275196309500,Tue Sep 08 16:09:43 +0000 2015,4/ It's remarkable--and I think great for the world--that "engineer" is now a better qualification for CEO of a tech company than "MBA".
641281763973578800,Tue Sep 08 16:07:41 +0000 2015,3/ But now many of the highest-paid jobs are engineers, "developer" is a high-status word, and people can have huge impact early on.
641281539481833500,Tue Sep 08 16:06:48 +0000 2015,2/ For a long time, the builders were not the ruling class--if you wanted to really succeed, you had to go into finance or get an MBA.

635893735818182700,Mon Aug 24 19:17:35 +0000 2015,Here is the question: where can it possibly go next?
635893684253368300,Mon Aug 24 19:17:23 +0000 2015,In 99/00 we had the tech bubble in SV. Then shifted to NY with the finance bubble. Now it's in DC w/the government (interest rate) bubble.
635893573456691200,Mon Aug 24 19:16:56 +0000 2015,Here is my theory of recent bubbles:
635893025240141800,Mon Aug 24 19:14:46 +0000 2015,Panic sets in as the S&amp;P approaches levels not seen since last October.

635876459307896800,Mon Aug 24 18:08:56 +0000 2015,However, since people say I never say anything positive about bitcoin: it looks like real transaction volume is finally picking up. Big.
635875506030641200,Mon Aug 24 18:05:09 +0000 2015,The combined total valuation of bitcoin startups is worth significantly more than that combined total value of all bitcoins.
635859302436110300,Mon Aug 24 17:00:46 +0000 2015,When someone gives you career advice, think "Will this person be negatively affected (or made envious) if everyone like me doesn't listen?"
635856361939599400,Mon Aug 24 16:49:04 +0000 2015,However, you have to be patient about getting rich. In fact, the most valuable paths usually involve not being rich for awhile.

635674470598885400,Mon Aug 24 04:46:18 +0000 2015,Honestly, a very under-rated benefit of investing in startups is the price doesn't quote every day. It's so much less stressful.

635541648450129900,Sun Aug 23 19:58:31 +0000 2015,I.E., maybe public companies worth less than many tens of billions of dollars are ruled by short-term shareholders.
635541473698652200,Sun Aug 23 19:57:49 +0000 2015,Crazy thought: maybe it's totally rational, b/c being public means less value creation for all but the best/most powerful companies.

633380926534258700,Mon Aug 17 20:52:35 +0000 2015,But high cash comp for investors makes them risk-averse--they don't want it to stop. It makes them less likely to actually fund innovation.

633322678519140400,Mon Aug 17 17:01:07 +0000 2015,Just seems easier to spin out Yahoo than spin out Alibaba given the tax issues etc.
633322463292584000,Mon Aug 17 17:00:16 +0000 2015,I.E., investors can get what they want, and Mayer can take the Yahoo operating businesses private for free. And fits tax code easily.
633322226553491500,Mon Aug 17 16:59:20 +0000 2015,Serious question--if Yahoo without Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is worth nothing, why don't they just spin out the operating businesses?

628712862656008200,Tue Aug 04 23:43:22 +0000 2015,4/ you probably shouldn't hire them anyway. you should be happy people are asking for a lot of equity, especially with a low salary.

628675279146213400,Tue Aug 04 21:14:01 +0000 2015,3/ though i'll mention that everyone at YC called "partner" is actually a parter, with full decision-making ability
628675118592495600,Tue Aug 04 21:13:23 +0000 2015,2/ now everyone is called "partner"--the title has inflated to become meaningless.  you need to ask "do you have decision-making ability?"
628674808734036000,Tue Aug 04 21:12:09 +0000 2015,1/ it used to be that founders could just ask if an investor was a partner to determine decision-making ability

628259316269604900,Mon Aug 03 17:41:08 +0000 2015,if you are not willing to take a short-term stock hit for long-term wins, you won't be great.  few CEOs are willing to do this.
628259152091938800,Mon Aug 03 17:40:29 +0000 2015,on the other hand, CEOs that care a lot about what wall street thinks disappoint nearly 100% of the time.
628258898156195800,Mon Aug 03 17:39:28 +0000 2015,but it can sometimes work if you hire a missionary CEO (@tim_cook, @satyanadella) that doesn't care too much about wall street.
628258680580915200,Mon Aug 03 17:38:36 +0000 2015,missionaries are good CEOs; good founders are missionaries.  for a long time, when VCs hired an outside CEO they hired a mercenary.

596425498407874600,Thu May 07 21:24:54 +0000 2015,3) I also think investors deserve what they get here-investors have more experience than founders and being helpful to founders is their job

590267860024307700,Mon Apr 20 21:36:39 +0000 2015,3) more generally, bad investors can cause problems for a company like nothing else when things go wrong.
590267731330531300,Mon Apr 20 21:36:08 +0000 2015,2) we assume that a company that has gone through an accelerator should have been accelerated. if not, we wonder if there's something wrong.
590267579907715100,Mon Apr 20 21:35:32 +0000 2015,1) i think founders underestimate how much a bad accelerator hurts them--it makes the bar to get in to YC much higher, for example.
590266838488985600,Mon Apr 20 21:32:35 +0000 2015,4) unfortunately, this is still bad for the companies in these accelerators, especially the ones that don't get the internal A round offer.
590266633559519200,Mon Apr 20 21:31:46 +0000 2015,3) so perhaps the way to think about the fact that accelerators ex-YC lose money is not that it's a bubble, but that they are lead gen

585855173253177300,Wed Apr 08 17:22:12 +0000 2015,2) i think one of the most important things YC does for startups is let them stop worrying about money for a little while and just focus
585854958165078000,Wed Apr 08 17:21:21 +0000 2015,1) everyone knows you can trade money for time, which is great, but the more important thing is you can use money to reduce cognitive load

585480630932217900,Tue Apr 07 16:33:54 +0000 2015,if you can get to profitability on the money you have without having to raise more, then you're in good shape. if not, you won't sleep well.
585480404691464200,Tue Apr 07 16:33:00 +0000 2015,it is ok to raise money.  it is even to burn a lot of money.  but you should always strive to have profitable within grasp.
585480279768301600,Tue Apr 07 16:32:31 +0000 2015,i have seen more later stage companies do something stupid because they needed to please investors that for any other reason.
585480119101354000,Tue Apr 07 16:31:52 +0000 2015,and the refrain of later-stage companies: "i know burning 1MM a month is dangerous, but we are special. our investors are committed to us."
585479837252513800,Tue Apr 07 16:30:45 +0000 2015,and so even if investors don't get it, which they often don't, the company can still happen.
585479745967693800,Tue Apr 07 16:30:23 +0000 2015,this applies to almost all stages. one of the big advantages young founders have is they are (more frequently) able to live very cheaply.
585479545186345000,Tue Apr 07 16:29:35 +0000 2015,if a company is profitable; it's controlled by the founders.  if it's not, it's controlled by investors.

579732406812303400,Sun Mar 22 19:52:31 +0000 2015,I think seed prices are often disconnected from reality. I just don't think it's the fault of founders.
579732162158542800,Sun Mar 22 19:51:33 +0000 2015,to make my own views clear: I would like to see less money chasing seed startups. I think it'd be better all around.

579726378741837800,Sun Mar 22 19:28:34 +0000 2015,4) founders make their own decisions about how much value they'll actually get from investors, and whether to give a discount for it
579726271644504000,Sun Mar 22 19:28:08 +0000 2015,3) but there's not much we can do about market pricing--there are a lot of investors willing to pay high prices.
579726126320222200,Sun Mar 22 19:27:33 +0000 2015,2) believe it or not, we really try to tell founders not to optimize for valuation.  most actually listen and don't take the higher offer.

568261371277611000,Thu Feb 19 04:10:43 +0000 2015,@danielpsegundo yes i was a CS major (dropped out for YC)
568229661018165250,Thu Feb 19 02:04:43 +0000 2015,9) and that usually comes right at the wrong time--ie, right when you're running out of money
568229591380160500,Thu Feb 19 02:04:26 +0000 2015,8) while it's true that if everything is going amazing well a high burn rate won't hurt much, most startups go through a trough of sorrow
568229372911431700,Thu Feb 19 02:03:34 +0000 2015,7) anyway, founders would do well to remember that having an almost comically low burn in the early days work more often than the opposite
568229069810049000,Thu Feb 19 02:02:22 +0000 2015,6) founders seem to think "well we need money and the press loves us, so we'll be able to raise more for sure"
568228866436628500,Thu Feb 19 02:01:33 +0000 2015,5) this meets cold reality when companies try to raise money again w/little traction and a $150k a month burn rate--often means death
568228671879688200,Thu Feb 19 02:00:47 +0000 2015,4) and seed money is so easy to raise in the current environment that founders assume they can just raise more money whenever they want
568228513028792300,Thu Feb 19 02:00:09 +0000 2015,3) but every small increase in burn ramps up the company's willingness to spend in subtle ways
568228430291955700,Thu Feb 19 01:59:49 +0000 2015,2) it ends up being especially bad for startups where either the founders need big salaries or are non-technical and need to hire right away
568228280731455500,Thu Feb 19 01:59:13 +0000 2015,1) "keep your burn rate very low" is one of those unteachable lessons for early-stage startups

550418445729161200,Wed Dec 31 22:29:18 +0000 2014,the days are long but the years are short
550355466757238800,Wed Dec 31 18:19:03 +0000 2014,@Its_Fitz i'm a poker player :)
550354962236973060,Wed Dec 31 18:17:02 +0000 2014,it tilts me when mediocre VCs brag about how they will never meet a founder without an intro.
550349423398486000,Wed Dec 31 17:55:02 +0000 2014,"i really love that and use it all the time" is the best thing to hear when doing diligence on a new startup

550113605115342850,Wed Dec 31 02:17:58 +0000 2014,@kwuchu @jamiequint certainly glad that was the case for your peers; it hasn't been the case for many many talented people I've met
550111630286020600,Wed Dec 31 02:10:07 +0000 2014,@kwuchu the kid I taught walked a few miles to meet me there. not saying it's not incredibly hard and unjust, just saying it's often doable.
550110783195988000,Wed Dec 31 02:06:45 +0000 2014,@kwuchu what about free access at libraries? I taught someone to code there once, it worked pretty well.
550110475199848450,Wed Dec 31 02:05:32 +0000 2014,last immigration tweet for awhile: most Americans saying no immigration are here because their families immigrated in the last 200 years
549791893848985600,Tue Dec 30 04:59:36 +0000 2014,@beLaurie I love going home but my mom always makes me eat too much food. health hazard after a week.
549786759387574300,Tue Dec 30 04:39:12 +0000 2014,progression of operations at most startups: lots of people -&gt; shitty tools -&gt; good tools
549761659766456300,Tue Dec 30 02:59:28 +0000 2014,@tommyrva it was. referring to loopt here
549757611927564300,Tue Dec 30 02:43:23 +0000 2014,(have not had instant ramen since)
549757566964621300,Tue Dec 30 02:43:12 +0000 2014,when i was starting my startup i lived on instant ramen and coffee ice cream. today had coffee ice cream for first time in 8 yrs, wretched.
549752607225307140,Tue Dec 30 02:23:30 +0000 2014,@kwuchu @kylejson @ycombinator i discuss it with someone literally every day.  it's a huge problem. i think progress is too slow.
549749571698425860,Tue Dec 30 02:11:26 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator 2 so i'm confident with more effort we can do more here)
549749454782201860,Tue Dec 30 02:10:58 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator 1/ (we were also able to significantly increase number of black founders applying by making a focused effort
549749303275581440,Tue Dec 30 02:10:22 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator very important to fix that, but for me discriminating on country of birth is equally unjust
549749198602502140,Tue Dec 30 02:09:57 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator i think blacks and latinos face horrible discrimination in tech and especially when started companies
549749082906841100,Tue Dec 30 02:09:29 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator incidentally, we funded black and latino founders at a slightly higher rate than rate of applications @ YC
549748858754846700,Tue Dec 30 02:08:36 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator we shouldn't discriminate on either
549748797765455900,Tue Dec 30 02:08:21 +0000 2014,@kylejson @kwuchu @ycombinator because i believe it's the just thing to. color of skin and country of birth are both out of one's control.
549746909473021950,Tue Dec 30 02:00:51 +0000 2014,@sfslim time and valuing learning is a separate thing, but that can be an individual choice (though i strongly agree we should support more)
549746694900813800,Tue Dec 30 02:00:00 +0000 2014,@sfslim the last time i heard, i think 90% of the US population uses the internet.  libraries have free computers and free internet access!
549746113146658800,Tue Dec 30 01:57:41 +0000 2014,@brad989 i don't know for employees at companies, but i'd guess majority of founder-engineers we've funded are self-taught.
549745337833775100,Tue Dec 30 01:54:36 +0000 2014,@seb_m of course it would have to be based on location.
549745218371592200,Tue Dec 30 01:54:08 +0000 2014,also, when people say "we need to train more coders domestically": while that's true, anyone who wants can teach themselves to code online
549744294995566600,Tue Dec 30 01:50:28 +0000 2014,@kwuchu @kylejson @ycombinator unless we design the bandaid to fix domestic issues (i.e. matching contributions to STEM education)
549743054689554400,Tue Dec 30 01:45:32 +0000 2014,@dragon_lord42 i predict that will start to happen, and it's a shame for the US economy.
549742389913346050,Tue Dec 30 01:42:54 +0000 2014,@jdavidsonlawyer why is that? why would a company prefer to hire an immigrant over someone from clemson if it required a matching donation?
549742165224480800,Tue Dec 30 01:42:00 +0000 2014,@kwuchu @kylejson @ycombinator but it takes a long time to have an effect, and we don't have a long time to wait, so we should do both
549741972752060400,Tue Dec 30 01:41:14 +0000 2014,@kwuchu @kylejson @ycombinator FWIW, i think fixing education is more important to long-term future of the country than fixing immigration
549738939603357700,Tue Dec 30 01:29:11 +0000 2014,3/ would people support it?
549738889875714050,Tue Dec 30 01:28:59 +0000 2014,2/ if a visa required the wage to be at or above 85th percentile for a field and a matching donation to STEM education for US citizens...
549738704114180100,Tue Dec 30 01:28:15 +0000 2014,1/ seems the most common objections to engineering visa are 1) wage pressure and 2) a feeling we should be training US citizens instead
549738007914233860,Tue Dec 30 01:25:29 +0000 2014,@kwuchu @kylejson @ycombinator why can't we address both? also, many immigrants we would like to fund are black/latino
549633841959161860,Mon Dec 29 18:31:34 +0000 2014,@photomatt @paulg that works for some software-only companies.  much harder for a company like spacex w/software and hardware.
549320824205738000,Sun Dec 28 21:47:45 +0000 2014,@adamdangelo @parkerconrad @rabois i agree that employee/founder liquidity is good for everyone!  and encourage it!  just not in year 1.
549316838413172740,Sun Dec 28 21:31:54 +0000 2014,@JSchwarz9 @rabois @parkerconrad i agree with this--i encourage founders to sell some stock in the C round, even when they don't want to
549313831575355400,Sun Dec 28 21:19:57 +0000 2014,my fav example of emergent behavior: changing the number of protons in a nucleus leads to such wildly different properties of the elements
549304431955550200,Sun Dec 28 20:42:36 +0000 2014,@adamdangelo @parkerconrad to be very clear, i am in favor of founders/employees selling some stock.  it's just a question of stage.
