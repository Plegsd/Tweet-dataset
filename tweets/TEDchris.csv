743185402903814100,Wed Jun 15 20:56:22 +0000 2016,A8. Always ask yourself: Do I have something worth saying? And be honest! If the answer is no, wait until you do. #BizChats
743183757998325800,Wed Jun 15 20:49:50 +0000 2016,A7. There’s no product or app that can beat sharing your planned talk with a small group of trusted friends. #BizChats
743182835201118200,Wed Jun 15 20:46:10 +0000 2016,A6. Making it all about me, my product, my plans...a talk should be a gift, not a take. Lead with your ego, you’ll lose the crowd. #BizChats

743180147780530200,Wed Jun 15 20:35:29 +0000 2016,A5. Fear of public speaking is there for a reason: it’s fight or flight! Use that adrenaline to motivate your preparation. #BizChats
743179700164567000,Wed Jun 15 20:33:42 +0000 2016,@aweyenberg  Refuse. Or sabotage. I know you can do it!  #bizchats

743178461888536600,Wed Jun 15 20:28:47 +0000 2016,A4. A talk is a journey. That means you start where the audience is. Every step of the journey has to be one they WANT to take. #BizChats
743177764405055500,Wed Jun 15 20:26:01 +0000 2016,A3. Plan to be yourself. If you’re creative, be creative. If you’re funny, be funny. (If you’re full of ego, be someone else.) #BizChats
743177367854583800,Wed Jun 15 20:24:26 +0000 2016,A3. Two different ways to prepare: Script the full talk. Or speak ‘in the moment’ from bullet-points. Benefits and traps to each! #BizChats
743177202716442600,Wed Jun 15 20:23:47 +0000 2016,@nadiagoodman A lot of us get nervous. It's OK. Many of the best speakers are introverts. Check out @SusanCain. #BizChats
743176570114740200,Wed Jun 15 20:21:16 +0000 2016,A3. The answer is there in the question: prepare! Musicians rehearse, athletes practice… “winging it” isn’t a recipe for success. #BizChats
743176353688621000,Wed Jun 15 20:20:24 +0000 2016,So true. But introverts can play too. You don't have to fake high energy! Be authentic. https://t.co/4rdOyLgzZJ
743175275370979300,Wed Jun 15 20:16:07 +0000 2016,A2. The best speakers commit to giving, not taking. Don’t boast, sell or promote. Instead GIVE your audience an idea they can use. #BizChats
743174813741506600,Wed Jun 15 20:14:17 +0000 2016,A2. There’s only one true essential to public speaking. Have something worth saying. #BizChats
743174699602034700,Wed Jun 15 20:13:50 +0000 2016,Q2. Anyone who talks as well as @AdamMGrant ?  I mean, have you SEEN his TED Talk? #BizChats
743174230418698200,Wed Jun 15 20:11:58 +0000 2016,@tyarde @AdamMGrant @mashbusiness  Hi, Tiffany. Here are 3. Rambling (lack of prep), over-selling, and style over substance. Steer clear!
743172794779734000,Wed Jun 15 20:06:16 +0000 2016,A1. It’s of no use at all… apart from sharing a vision, sparking collaboration, inspiring your team to care... ;) #BizChats
