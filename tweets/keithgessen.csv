715582391167946800,Thu Mar 31 16:51:51 +0000 2016,Trump is newsworthy/historical for saying out loud what Repubs have been saying between the lines since 1968. But he's not covered that way.

571772416940232700,Sat Feb 28 20:42:21 +0000 2015,@JustinRaimondo As for Nemtsov, based my observation of Rus politics for 20 yrs, incl pol murder (http://t.co/2qLVoRSX7O), that's my belief.
571772058889297900,Sat Feb 28 20:40:56 +0000 2015,@JustinRaimondo I agree with you 100%. I'm a US citizen and my duty is to criticize my govt. No disagreement there.
571771394603790340,Sat Feb 28 20:38:18 +0000 2015,@JustinRaimondo I have no proof of what? I specifically said Putin didn't order the killing. There won't be any proof. Ever.
571770643701743600,Sat Feb 28 20:35:19 +0000 2015,@JustinRaimondo I see I misunderstood the word combination "anti-war." I have no proof of Rus govt involvement, only their pro-war hysteria.
571769849405435900,Sat Feb 28 20:32:09 +0000 2015,@JustinRaimondo You edit a site called antiwar. Nemtsov was anti-war. The Rus govt is pro-war.

565060572379873300,Tue Feb 10 08:11:53 +0000 2015,@sjrabinov I meant the question of whether the US is a democracy is irrelevant to determining whether it's done a good or bad thing.
