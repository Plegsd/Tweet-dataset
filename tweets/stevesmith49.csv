27358638389592064,Tue Jan 18 13:36:22 +0000 2011,6-5 Hewitt. Playing from infront now. We need him to play his shots this game and not wait for nalbandian to make the mistakes #beaggressive
27357618859147264,Tue Jan 18 13:32:19 +0000 2011,@hasto194 5 all on serve. Hewitt down 15-40. 2 break points nalbandian.
27357136744878080,Tue Jan 18 13:30:24 +0000 2011,Hewitt really lifted for that game. Now his chance to play from infront. Keep that energy lleyton!!
27354016581160960,Tue Jan 18 13:18:00 +0000 2011,This nalbandian service game is the most crucial of the match. Can hewitt lift and get the break tweeps?? #mentalstrengthisthekey!!
27351223044673536,Tue Jan 18 13:06:54 +0000 2011,Lleyton Hewitt looks done and dusted here. Hasn't taken advantage of break points... #takingadvantageofbreakpointsarecritical!!

27346524681797630,Tue Jan 18 12:48:14 +0000 2011,Nalbandian has some good momentum coming into the 5th set and hewitts first service game was steady. Going to have to lift a notch Hewitt.
27325952388243456,Tue Jan 18 11:26:29 +0000 2011,Hewitt good comeback here. Good call from Hewitt "your the worst umpire in the world!!" haha.
