629595068685389800,Fri Aug 07 10:08:56 +0000 2015,9/10 @Praco is making a real impact on society. Solving problems in an industry that touches everyone. Its a privilege to be part of it.
629594546549080000,Fri Aug 07 10:06:51 +0000 2015,8/10 @Practo is now the #1 healthcare platform in india. Tens of millions of patients have directly/indirectly used it
629594410657800200,Fri Aug 07 10:06:19 +0000 2015,7/10. Practo evolved and built moat through products &amp; onboarding doctors. One practice at a time. Driving adoption. No short cuts.
629594109330616300,Fri Aug 07 10:05:07 +0000 2015,6/10. We believed that healthcare had to adopt technology, even if it took time. @Practo would build a unified healthcare platform for India
629593766471450600,Fri Aug 07 10:03:45 +0000 2015,5/10. But @shashanknd and the @Practo team were on a mission. A mission we found deeply inspiring.
629593528687931400,Fri Aug 07 10:02:49 +0000 2015,4/10. There was no easy gmv growth via discounting. Healthcare is not the fastest mkt. Its a late adopter of technology
629593274668298200,Fri Aug 07 10:01:48 +0000 2015,3/10. For the next 46 months (until Feb15), Sequoia was the only VC in practo's cap table, leading 3 rounds. Those ~4 years were not easy
629593037950160900,Fri Aug 07 10:00:52 +0000 2015,2/10. Sequoia first invested &lt; $0.5M in Practo 53 months ago in March 2011.
629592814687424500,Fri Aug 07 09:59:58 +0000 2015,1/10 Its easy to put all start-ups in the same bucket. Some stories are different. @Practo is one of them.
