743688748093714400,Fri Jun 17 06:16:29 +0000 2016,No one ever dared MJ, Kobe, Kareem, Magic, Bird et al to do that. They didn't dare. And that's what separates LeBron from them for me.
743688310728495100,Fri Jun 17 06:14:44 +0000 2016,It's the worst-kept secret, demonstrated again 2night: teams dare LeBron to beat them as a scorer. Sometimes he makes them pay. Sometimes.
743686564723593200,Fri Jun 17 06:07:48 +0000 2016,So we're going to rave about LeBron's domination but ignore that a guy who couldn't jump/move guarded him. Got it. https://t.co/qwNQnrIso1

725382335957364700,Wed Apr 27 17:53:20 +0000 2016,By the way, for LAC fans saying their team would've been fine w/Blake: haven't you seen how he's played or team's tepid react to his injury?
725375367339331600,Wed Apr 27 17:25:39 +0000 2016,And for anyone who wants to point to the highest payroll, the Cavs, being the same: don't love their roster, either, but CP3 isn't LeBron.
725374355132158000,Wed Apr 27 17:21:37 +0000 2016,FWIW: I've long admired LAC fans cuz they've endured so much. But the NBA's 2nd-highest payroll shouldn't be all about 1 guy. And it is.
725372127071723500,Wed Apr 27 17:12:46 +0000 2016,This isn't about championship caliber. It's about getting out of the 1st rd against no-experience overachievers. https://t.co/FiBuxMFIEJ

697929099587776500,Thu Feb 11 23:43:58 +0000 2016,Right. So why does drafting a top 5 pick = title, when those top 5s didn't win for the teams that drafted them? https://t.co/uGMOtk59Sk
697927974570631200,Thu Feb 11 23:39:30 +0000 2016,Dead wrong. Losing due to circumstances (injuries, turmoil, relocation) doesn't send message it's OK to lose.  https://t.co/S74TuIps0l
