715413519936557000,Thu Mar 31 05:40:49 +0000 2016,@smc90 i can build a warehouse to store 3rd party marketplace stuff and help with shipping for sellers
715413115874074600,Thu Mar 31 05:39:13 +0000 2016,@smc90 i.e. help with warehousing and shipping for marketplace. India needs it  to improve logistics and infrastructure for good service
715412850131402800,Thu Mar 31 05:38:09 +0000 2016,@smc90 it does sound like they are supportive of the "fulfillment by amazon" model for the marketplace
715412651694628900,Thu Mar 31 05:37:22 +0000 2016,@smc90 Hence the cap of 25% on sellers and limitations around discounting. While they don't support 1st party inventory model...

715410802174353400,Thu Mar 31 05:30:01 +0000 2016,@smc90 I think this is a bit different. Unsustainable discounts from 1st party inventory owned retailers drive other mom&amp;pop out of business
