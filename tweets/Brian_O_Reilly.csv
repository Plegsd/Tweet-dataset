720716359097827300,Thu Apr 14 20:52:24 +0000 2016,Michael HR really channeling a mafia boss vibe tonight. Kerry meets the Sopranos.  #rtept https://t.co/PRPLpYbiGo
720699387064791000,Thu Apr 14 19:44:58 +0000 2016,FF are bricking the thoughts of govt. Aim in #ge16 was to grow TD number, not return to govt. They never expected FG to do so poorly. #Dail
720684968834441200,Thu Apr 14 18:47:40 +0000 2016,The vitriol being directed at Katherine Zappone is a bit premature. Let's see the deal. She didn't vote for Kenny for the craic. #Dail
720679777787592700,Thu Apr 14 18:27:03 +0000 2016,The civil service should run in GE16-II.  They're doing a grand job now.  No petty squabbling, and they don't take 8 months summer holidays.
720574243134644200,Thu Apr 14 11:27:41 +0000 2016,This guy is using God's power and a photo of the "patient" to cure herpes.  You just email him your picture. https://t.co/XHnfX3eZTM

718130739011780600,Thu Apr 07 17:38:05 +0000 2016,Frank Underwood would be proud of FG today. How to look the peacemaker when you're the warmonger.
718100366030737400,Thu Apr 07 15:37:23 +0000 2016,If you can rely on Fianna F√°il for 1 thing it's to be unreliable.  They're like the cheating spouse who begs to come home then cheats again.

714446764191916000,Mon Mar 28 13:39:17 +0000 2016,A lot more loud, inaudible shouting than usual on #liveline today.  It's rising related, from what I can gather through the yelling.
714184253358141400,Sun Mar 27 20:16:09 +0000 2016,I'm going to go ahead and call this my favourite movie-based rant of all time. #SadAffleck = new leave Britney alone https://t.co/n0BtPDWZml

713805566167105500,Sat Mar 26 19:11:23 +0000 2016,I think the Saturday night slot really suits #rtethevoice. Always found Sundays an odd choice. Yes I tweet about TV scheduling now.

703666875759198200,Sat Feb 27 19:43:51 +0000 2016,I think @sarahdfiner should have a guest slot on #melfest every week. I mean they cut an 8th song, so that's 3 minutes right there for her.
703624719023657000,Sat Feb 27 16:56:20 +0000 2016,Also, Renua doomed from the beginning. If you can't organise your launch properly how can you expect to be trusted in govt #GE16
703624087243980800,Sat Feb 27 16:53:49 +0000 2016,FG lost #GE16 rather than any other party winning it. Campaigning like an opposition party when incumbent govt flopped spectacularly.

702509089771941900,Wed Feb 24 15:03:13 +0000 2016,#GE16 defined by "don't vote for the other guy". No policies, no positivity, no real change on offer.  Abroad, unable to vote &amp; delighted.

699375613010976800,Mon Feb 15 23:31:54 +0000 2016,I think if there's one thing we can all agree on after #leadersdebate on #cblive it's that Donald Trump needs to freelance for debates.
699374653501022200,Mon Feb 15 23:28:05 +0000 2016,All frantically reading off their notes as they realise how many points their spin doctors wrote down they haven't made yet. #leadersdebate
699373772537794600,Mon Feb 15 23:24:35 +0000 2016,"No difference between FF and FG" says Lucinda. Thank God she didn't devote a decade of her life to either party. #cblive #leadersdebate

699369244119666700,Mon Feb 15 23:06:36 +0000 2016,Jaysus Lucinda, now referencing US policy. Have Renua actually come up with any original policies at all? Copy and paste manifesto. #cblive
699367092798300200,Mon Feb 15 22:58:03 +0000 2016,Gerry met the Credit Union a few weeks ago.  Nice that in 2016 he doesn't have to clarify it wasn't while wearing a balaclava. #cblive
699364666565398500,Mon Feb 15 22:48:24 +0000 2016,To be honest Lucinda, there are plenty of things that worked in Germany I'm glad didn't really take off here. #cblive
699364222510198800,Mon Feb 15 22:46:38 +0000 2016,Is Lucinda wearing a genuine Margaret Thatcher outfit or just a replica? #cblive
699362957277466600,Mon Feb 15 22:41:37 +0000 2016,Micheal talking about health is about as credible as the captain of the Titanic offering advice on navigating around icebergs #cblive
699362035612717000,Mon Feb 15 22:37:57 +0000 2016,I really believe in Micheal's vision for health. If only he had ever been Minister we'd have no problems now.
699357910246301700,Mon Feb 15 22:21:33 +0000 2016,"We don't want chaos for the next five years" says MM. Yes, lets go back to the stability FF offered 2008-2011. Golden times. #cblive
699355214319611900,Mon Feb 15 22:10:51 +0000 2016,Jesus Claire, don't ask Gerry anything more in-depth about the plan beyond its title. You can't expect him to know that #cblive
699354430420971500,Mon Feb 15 22:07:44 +0000 2016,Joan is the debating equivalent of a submission wrestler. Just keeps going until everyone else passes out and gives up. #cblive
699346670555947000,Mon Feb 15 21:36:54 +0000 2016,Hoping there's a "denials" section in #leadersdebate tonight. Gerry denies being in IRA, MM denies being in FF between 2007 and 2011, etc

628663143393271800,Tue Aug 04 20:25:48 +0000 2015,Oh, TV3 are showing a documentary on travellers. Should just give the topic a weekly slot at this stage.

618890086885797900,Wed Jul 08 21:11:09 +0000 2015,Convenient how Nick wants rid of Harry ahead of the final. So transparent. Game playing. #BBUK
617767688849489900,Sun Jul 05 18:51:09 +0000 2015,So, I assume the EU will tell them to hold another #greekreferendum , ala Lisbon here.
617758595745194000,Sun Jul 05 18:15:01 +0000 2015,BFF Cyprus texts Greece: "You ok Hun? Sorry really busy can't hang out this week." *deletes as Facebook friend* #greekreferendum

611294706941710300,Wed Jun 17 22:09:50 +0000 2015,So, my first #VinB people's debate and it's fair to say they heavily researched the area to find the best local ramblers.
611294119265177600,Wed Jun 17 22:07:29 +0000 2015,I think the #vinb debate should just go to death match.  Whoever survives the brawl gets the seats.
611288268760567800,Wed Jun 17 21:44:15 +0000 2015,Brian is the biggest fake in #BBUK history. He brought Chloe into the frame of being nominated then denied it to Jack. Fake.
611284622874406900,Wed Jun 17 21:29:45 +0000 2015,Question the mental captivity of people who think Brian on #BBUK is  being real. He knows he has a "character" to re-establish for TV work.
611279881930977300,Wed Jun 17 21:10:55 +0000 2015,Oh sweet Devine. Brian is just as much as a fake as he was back in the olden days. Complete game player still. #BBUK
611254100836110300,Wed Jun 17 19:28:28 +0000 2015,Considering a move into professional wrestling. It combines my two favourite things; trashy TV and violence.
610719536103465000,Tue Jun 16 08:04:18 +0000 2015,Scarlet for #Xfactor with Ora. It's the TV show equivalent of a balding middle aged man buying a red sports car.
608737345903431700,Wed Jun 10 20:47:47 +0000 2015,@Deanfitz it's called being curvy. It's the fashion.
