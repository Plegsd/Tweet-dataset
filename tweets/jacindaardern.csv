643656587177922600,Tue Sep 15 05:24:23 +0000 2015,@Suzyiam we also asked for the no vote to be added, for designers to be on panel, for less money to be wasted..
643655501130010600,Tue Sep 15 05:20:04 +0000 2015,@Suzyiam no. That was not what the gathering of MPs was. It was to receive the petition asking for its inclusion as an option.
643655010522271700,Tue Sep 15 05:18:07 +0000 2015,@Suzyiam and if 50% say no change, then the process ends there. Simple.
643654837767311400,Tue Sep 15 05:17:26 +0000 2015,@Suzyiam we've been clear- first ask people if they want change, then give them diverse options if they do. Current process does neither
