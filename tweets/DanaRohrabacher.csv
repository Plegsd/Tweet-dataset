640409013470031900,Sun Sep 06 06:19:41 +0000 2015,@MANX38 can I ask you a direct question? Do you believe in abortions open till the moment of birth? If not when do you draw the line?
640408437558480900,Sun Sep 06 06:17:24 +0000 2015,@MANX38 this is core issue:at which moment is it human life? I respect those who insist not till birth, but, with 3 kids, I must disagree.
640388491294187500,Sun Sep 06 04:58:08 +0000 2015,@MANX38 how about caring for such a baby after it is born? Would U permit the extermination of such a baby because it is product of rape?

640369819901161500,Sun Sep 06 03:43:57 +0000 2015,@MANX38 can’t answer? If a minute after birth we would not want it killed, so too before it is born we wouldn’t want it killed
640348063014486000,Sun Sep 06 02:17:29 +0000 2015,@Fieryreddragon that is correct. It is why employers who hire illegals should face legal action of some kind

587006105223594000,Sat Apr 11 21:35:36 +0000 2015,@PaulNiland my understanding EU offer was no chance of Common Market, Russian offered fundamental new Econ relationship not just more debt
587004576814997500,Sat Apr 11 21:29:31 +0000 2015,@PaulNiland that is fair, but when juxtaposing negotiations, specific day of offer may not be as relevant as you suggest.
