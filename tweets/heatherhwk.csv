678292329719971800,Sat Dec 19 19:14:28 +0000 2015,I'm sure any artist would much rather talk about something they like, and why, than dislike.
678290763990470700,Sat Dec 19 19:08:14 +0000 2015,Just saw a whole interview with a band that strictly talks about a song they hate... and this is a column.

678027829926215700,Sat Dec 19 01:43:26 +0000 2015,Also it's amazing to me that people forget music (all art for that matter) is subjective.
