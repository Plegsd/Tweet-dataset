227662889287315460,Tue Jul 24 07:13:57 +0000 2012,The only valid conclusion from IRS state migration data is Bob Ehrlich presided over an exodus of Md residents that reversed under O'Malley
227657821179752450,Tue Jul 24 06:53:48 +0000 2012,@TaxFoundation widget also shows O'Malley has steadily reversed Ehrlich Exodus. In most recent year, 2009 we GAINED residents #MdPolitics

227655862695637000,Tue Jul 24 06:46:01 +0000 2012,Over the 4 yrs Ehrlich was governor,Md lost 61,311 net residents.Over O'Malley's 1st 4 years we lost 30,706, as Larry Hogan said #MdPolitics
227646506163904500,Tue Jul 24 06:08:51 +0000 2012,So Larry Hogan must have been making lousy appointments when he was Bob Ehrlich's appointments secretary &amp; all those people were fleeing Md

227623381250490370,Tue Jul 24 04:36:57 +0000 2012,So Larry Hogan's claim that O'Malley policies caused an exodus from Maryland is ridiculous.More left when Ehrlich was governor. #MdPolitics

90823483604484100,Tue Jul 12 16:43:00 +0000 2011,I always thought my 6th grade teacher,Eileen Trueman,the best teacher in the history of the world, could have been a power hitting shortstop
90813012130283520,Tue Jul 12 16:01:23 +0000 2011,It's wrong that a Yankees shortstop earns $200 million while the best teachers earn less than 1% of that @jeanne_ohh but value=supply:demand
90806682959085570,Tue Jul 12 15:36:14 +0000 2011,I'll remind you to be so gratuitously kind next time one of my, er, fortunate charges, could use a break @bpsears :)
90805352165150720,Tue Jul 12 15:30:57 +0000 2011,But Jeter should return the favor by having his accountants make sure the fan gets his prizes with no tax liability, which isn't hard to do.
90804103617323000,Tue Jul 12 15:26:00 +0000 2011,The idea that the humble fan shouldn't just give away something of value to a rich sports star is wrong. Giving is always good.
90802629583712260,Tue Jul 12 15:20:08 +0000 2011,The fan had the right idea. He's not a chump as others are saying, but he should give the ball to Jeter's Turn 2 Foundation & get deduction
90801271581310980,Tue Jul 12 15:14:44 +0000 2011,To make it work, Jeter (or someone else) would have to buy the ball from his Turn 2 Foundation for $250,000 (or more!)
90800700560375800,Tue Jul 12 15:12:28 +0000 2011,The fan should donate the ball to Jeter's foundation @dangainor & get the same prize. Charitable deduction would wipe out tax liability 100%
90784297748938750,Tue Jul 12 14:07:17 +0000 2011,Fan who caught Jeter's 3,000 hit (2,999 acc to O's fans) needs a better accountant @dangainor $32k gifts - $250k ball = net loss. No tax due

87557177308495870,Sun Jul 03 16:23:52 +0000 2011,Bare bones non-ACA health insurance is nothing more than a donation from working poor people to insurance companies @MarkNewgent

87551225817595900,Sun Jul 03 16:00:13 +0000 2011,....Finding that Medicaid patients do so&so doesn't establish causality.Medicaid participants have less access to care, seek care later, etc

87546330620235780,Sun Jul 03 15:40:46 +0000 2011,....Clinton/Gingrich "end welfare as we know it" block grants worked because at the same time EITC was hugely increased & made "refundable."
87545480850059260,Sun Jul 03 15:37:23 +0000 2011,...Because people who are sick or injured can't get better without health care. Plus, the secret of Clinton/Gingrich welfare block grants...
