872830339718185000,Thu Jun 08 14:59:04 +0000 2017,Essentially, Comey keeps saying how uncomfortable and awkward he felt with Trump in every meeting they ever had.

872822095906033700,Thu Jun 08 14:26:18 +0000 2017,"I took it as a very concerning thing, very disturbing." Comey on conversations with Trump, doesn't call it "obstruction of justice."
872821640861757400,Thu Jun 08 14:24:30 +0000 2017,Comey has "no doubt" Russia interfered with 2016 presidential election. This is a HUGE deal, people.
