922376274793787400,Mon Oct 23 08:16:55 +0000 2017,13/n You would also see protests when citizens may die due to negligence of state, coz civic amenities are in shambles. Very valid!
922376190354014200,Mon Oct 23 08:16:35 +0000 2017,12/n Professions where getting murdered isn‚Äôt (and mustn't be) an occupational hazard in a democracy is what ppl stage protests against.

922376014281416700,Mon Oct 23 08:15:53 +0000 2017,10/n However, as a society, we MUST stage protests if Govt red tape/apathy leads 2 death of security personnel. THAT shows solidarity, care.

922375645958619100,Mon Oct 23 08:14:25 +0000 2017,5/n In security forces, they try to stop killers. Death IS an occupational hazard. It‚Äôs cruel, but it‚Äôs also reality. Can‚Äôt get around it.
922375556783521800,Mon Oct 23 08:14:04 +0000 2017,4/n In both cases, citizens from society usually join 2 show solidarity. Coz being murdered for doing your job is NOT right, or expected!
922375447807066100,Mon Oct 23 08:13:38 +0000 2017,3/n If a doctor is killed by a mob/individual, just for doing job, docs may go on strike, coz death by mob isn't an occupational hazard!
