625318437569478700,Sun Jul 26 14:55:08 +0000 2015,@vatrat_mulga Yes. Both him and Rojo. Rojo had passport issues but nobody knows why Di Maria missed his flight. Could only be 1 reason...
625314236449730600,Sun Jul 26 14:38:26 +0000 2015,Missing a flight because you want to join another club. This just increased my respect for De Gea who wants to leave in the right manner.
625313372347609100,Sun Jul 26 14:35:00 +0000 2015,It is just frustrating to read these Di Maria rumours. If he goes and we dont get a marquee player (NOT PEDRO), I'd be gutted! #MUFC
624924171701612500,Sat Jul 25 12:48:27 +0000 2015,If Ramos along with Pedro joins #Mufc and De gea stays, then we would have 5 Spaniards in our starting XI. How many does FCB and RMCF have?

486608192625864700,Tue Jul 08 20:30:08 +0000 2014,Hahahaha...the worst part of this game is that you cant even tell the brazilians to go home! #BrazilvsGermany
486591117584920600,Tue Jul 08 19:22:17 +0000 2014,I have found out why #Fred features in every Brazil match. Because Scolari can only count till 10. #WorldCup2014
486590205810339840,Tue Jul 08 19:18:40 +0000 2014,#Fred is a result of Scolari's one night of mad drinking! Why else would he even feature in every game? #BeatsMe #WorldCup2014
486589403104440300,Tue Jul 08 19:15:28 +0000 2014,#Fred is Brazil's Joginder Sharma
486588439362424800,Tue Jul 08 19:11:38 +0000 2014,#Fred - the name is enough. Enough to convince you he is shit!
486588068241997800,Tue Jul 08 19:10:10 +0000 2014,Chances of #Fred scoring a goal are lesser than #sharapova knowing about #tendulkar #WorldCup2014
486587739572146200,Tue Jul 08 19:08:52 +0000 2014,#CafeRio actually made a brave attempt to make a film of #Fred. Unless he performs a samba during half time, this brazilian has been useless

406476942842408960,Fri Nov 29 17:37:09 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy not exactly. Rooney is pretty versatile in that respect. Ronaldo, rvn, tevez and now rvp. Hes played with and excelled as well
406359428930093060,Fri Nov 29 09:50:12 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy goals are the only thing you cant doubt from rvp! I know rooney can give goals but playing rooney upfront will get predictable
406357204178989060,Fri Nov 29 09:41:21 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy you cant have rvp and chicha both on the bench. Rooney needs support in matches at times
406265534695485440,Fri Nov 29 03:37:06 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy he has played a few. Sad yes but can u start him ahead of rooney and rvp?
406162703955144700,Thu Nov 28 20:48:29 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy he does. How long will he play? I dont know and its sad that i dont :(
406161473044348900,Thu Nov 28 20:43:35 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy i know but rvp is too good to be benched honestly
406072507658031100,Thu Nov 28 14:50:04 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy that would mean rvp on the bench since you need to have two mids to protect the back 4.
406061053953323000,Thu Nov 28 14:04:34 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy rooney or kagawa to defend the wings when needed. Not when they attack. Jones+MC is a good defensive combo imo.
406011728170741760,Thu Nov 28 10:48:33 +0000 2013,For a player fast approaching 40, and still covering 10 kms in a game, is purely sensational! What a legend! #MUFC SirRyanGiggs #Wizard
406011075268591600,Thu Nov 28 10:45:58 +0000 2013,@RossoneriGuy we can always try this against the smaller teams at home. Jones and carrick in mid would ensure stability. Rooney/kagawa wings
405997003290603500,Thu Nov 28 09:50:03 +0000 2013,Rvp-rooney-kagawa front three with carrick-Jones-valencia in mid is one combination that should be tried. 4-1-4-1 or 4-1-3-2. #MUFC
