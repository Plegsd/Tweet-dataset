807737186779021300,Sun Dec 11 00:02:07 +0000 2016,Worlds was completely different, we practiced as hard as we could but ultimately failed. Hope that clears up some of the confusion!
807736996286242800,Sun Dec 11 00:01:21 +0000 2016,For All-stars I decided not to play 12 hours a day so I don't get burnt out when I start grinding hard late December for the new season.
807736807744032800,Sun Dec 11 00:00:36 +0000 2016,For IEM I had outside responsibilities and my families visit aswell as it being a last second decision so I was unable to practice full time
807736421859622900,Sat Dec 10 23:59:04 +0000 2016,Responses to my last tweet are pretty frustrating. Lack of practice for IEM and All-star were significantly different reasons.
807735951497789400,Sat Dec 10 23:57:12 +0000 2016,@Peaceler yes because these are off-season events where I either dont have time to practice 12 hours a day or choose not to to avoid burnout
807728510055907300,Sat Dec 10 23:27:38 +0000 2016,Only regret for this event was not practicing more prior. Even in a fun event, it's more entertaining for the fans and myself if I play well
