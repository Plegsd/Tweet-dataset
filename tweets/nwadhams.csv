13086385985,Thu Apr 29 19:51:53 +0000 2010,@texasinafrica Agreed. I've seen it at mitumba (http://bit.ly/by27iM). But what effect does 1m shirts have? Issue of scale? #1millionshirts
13085668502,Thu Apr 29 19:35:44 +0000 2010,@RichardTrillo Yes, it was the Nyeri Inn! All that remained were a few charred support beams and heaps of ash.

13068470103,Thu Apr 29 13:27:27 +0000 2010,@viewfromthecave not saying it's a great idea. but will 1mil shirts really skew the market? esp if his shirts will be sold? #1millionshirts
13067634434,Thu Apr 29 13:10:06 +0000 2010,@WhirlingD my point is that the shirt dude is taking flak b/c poeple say he will sink local textile makers. Not that simple. #1millionshirts

13060256128,Thu Apr 29 09:48:48 +0000 2010,@RichardTrillo Sure, but what's wrong with the impulse to give , anyway?
13058910079,Thu Apr 29 09:00:58 +0000 2010,Debate abt donating clothes to Africa ignores far more important factor - cheap Asian imports. Do donations really matter? #1millionshirts
