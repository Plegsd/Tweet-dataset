757663372674527200,Mon Jul 25 19:46:39 +0000 2016,and horrible. Imagine if these were human bodies. Please slow down and keep your eyes open for animals at all times

757662699329294300,Mon Jul 25 19:43:58 +0000 2016,to care for the animals who have increasingly smaller and smaller spaces to live in as we invade their habitat. Every animal you hit likely
757662264367472600,Mon Jul 25 19:42:15 +0000 2016,has babies that will starve now they're gone. Every animal is just trying to feed their family, just like you. If you don't care for most
757661851152965600,Mon Jul 25 19:40:36 +0000 2016,Animals, at least have compassion for their babies and imagine yourself in their situation.  Our roads shouldn't look like slaughter houses.
