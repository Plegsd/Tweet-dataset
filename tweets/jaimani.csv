526971844104962050,Tue Oct 28 05:40:52 +0000 2014,@gkjohn @Joylita @supriyan not necessarily :) Gmail was designed so that you don't *have* to delete email, which was crazy @ the time

525488081932013600,Fri Oct 24 03:24:56 +0000 2014,@rajupp @inboxbygmail this is one of the hardest design choices w email. The ppl who care abt archive or delete don't get the other use case
525487621573599200,Fri Oct 24 03:23:06 +0000 2014,@rajupp @inboxbygmail I don't check Done folder. I clear my inbox and save all in case the key to the human race has to do w knock off drugs
525486230427815940,Fri Oct 24 03:17:35 +0000 2014,@rajupp @inboxbygmail that seems like a bug to me. Spam folder on Gmail defaults to delete, probably something they should add to Inbox
