839497810391216100,Wed Mar 08 15:27:29 +0000 2017,Adams had gone too far. That fall, Jefferson beat him, let the Sedition Act expire &amp; pardoned Haswell. Elections have consequences. (12/)
839497547559358500,Wed Mar 08 15:26:27 +0000 2017,The good people of Bennington, Vt., had his back. They delayed their July 4 celebration 'til Haswell was released on July 9, 1800. (11/)
839497338901123100,Wed Mar 08 15:25:37 +0000 2017,Haswell, BTW, was a damn patriot: a Son of Liberty, witnessed the Boston Massacre, fought in the AmRev, jailed for seditious speech. (10/)
