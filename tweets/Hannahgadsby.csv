321508042690662400,Tue Apr 09 06:21:05 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview and you are sure I was talking about you? goodness me...
321468364423823360,Tue Apr 09 03:43:25 +0000 2013,@gen_stewart ha ha. seriously. I always use sex worker. I slipped publicly and apologized publicly. I know about the power of words.
321468018393751550,Tue Apr 09 03:42:02 +0000 2013,sadly, I think it's more important for people to maintain rage than accept a direct apology.
321465578726502400,Tue Apr 09 03:32:21 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview please enjoy your day. I am sorry if I bought it down. I got defensive. you are doing important stuff. I will reflect.
321465245275156500,Tue Apr 09 03:31:01 +0000 2013,@gen_stewart hey, I used the term in reference to a painting. not aggressively or deliberately to be hurtful. I really do care and I'm sorry
321464596672172000,Tue Apr 09 03:28:27 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview why do you get to choose fin.?
321463991362809860,Tue Apr 09 03:26:02 +0000 2013,@gen_stewart @whoreseyeview @elenajeffreys it was a hint. because I have been in a position of being oppressed too. sharing my experience
321463587484868600,Tue Apr 09 03:24:26 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview like I said. I usually do say the correct term.
321462930224848900,Tue Apr 09 03:21:49 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys I'm sorry. you did annoy me. but probably because I annoyed myself because I try to be a sensitive person.
321462502963683300,Tue Apr 09 03:20:07 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview I'm using bad language. I'm sorry again. I just want you to know: I know I made several language based mistakes here. sorry.
321462173673091100,Tue Apr 09 03:18:49 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview I'll rephrase. be angry if you like. just not at me.
321462070279282700,Tue Apr 09 03:18:24 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview not my intention. please don't be angry.
321461952742305800,Tue Apr 09 03:17:56 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview no no. let me make it clear: I was out of order. I apologised, publicly. what more would you have me do?
321461636928008200,Tue Apr 09 03:16:41 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview no I did not. really. I really want you to believe me. I would have blocked you otherwise. I'm a decent person.
321461411232505860,Tue Apr 09 03:15:47 +0000 2013,@hilaryjfb @elenajeffreys I've apologizes

321460110725615600,Tue Apr 09 03:10:37 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview @elenajeffreys yes. but anger never helps. this shit takes years because habit, not attitude, is often at the core.
321459076594802700,Tue Apr 09 03:06:30 +0000 2013,@whoreseyeview @elenajeffreys no no. please. I've apologized. I did a very human thing and got defensive. 99% of the time I say sex worker
321457154672455700,Tue Apr 09 02:58:52 +0000 2013,@FuckingMorgan ha ha. I am a guru.
321452351472934900,Tue Apr 09 02:39:47 +0000 2013,this morning on @radionational I used a very insensitive term for #sexworker. apologies.
321451090472206340,Tue Apr 09 02:34:46 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys I will tweet a formal apology, however.
321450997425791000,Tue Apr 09 02:34:24 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys just a hint... when you are trying to educate people... anger makes people defensive. not helpful in the long run.
321449050325008400,Tue Apr 09 02:26:40 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys I was talking about a painting. Im on the side of sex workers. just not you. you are annoying. I'll be more careful in future
321448025685901300,Tue Apr 09 02:22:36 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys I'm no longer on your side
321446770532028400,Tue Apr 09 02:17:36 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys yes. it's a 19th century thing. I'm on your side... that's what I mean. pick your battles.
321444556715470850,Tue Apr 09 02:08:49 +0000 2013,@ElenaJeffreys Olympia was a term for prostitute. not sex worker. it's a language thing. I don't call sex workers prostitutes.
