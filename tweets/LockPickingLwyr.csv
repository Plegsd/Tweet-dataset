1153447218193584000,Mon Jul 22 23:30:21 +0000 2019,@YankeeCISO Very related... same frequency.  SimpliSafe wouldn’t have worked on that block.
1153446677954596900,Mon Jul 22 23:28:12 +0000 2019,@sl600rt It sure wouldn’t be good for all the stuff near 2.4Ghz.

1153434621813690400,Mon Jul 22 22:40:18 +0000 2019,@Kromaatikse It’s not... I’ve looked up all the FCC docs on the system and it’s sensors.
1153434248348614700,Mon Jul 22 22:38:49 +0000 2019,@quentynblog Again, I’m talking about one particular system... SimpliSafe.
1153434049286983700,Mon Jul 22 22:38:01 +0000 2019,@tullyfur Why wouldn’t this just be part of a standard “trip” transmission? It’s a guess, but consistent with my experiments thus far. 🤷🏻‍♂️

1153430278028832800,Mon Jul 22 22:23:02 +0000 2019,@tullyfur I don’t think that’s permitted more than once per hour under FCC regs in this frequency. But to my knowledge, SS doesn’t do this.

1153423884563165200,Mon Jul 22 21:57:38 +0000 2019,@FredSavage187 It’s pretty common on high security locks... much less common on locks like this.
