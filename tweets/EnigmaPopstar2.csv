774221916781543400,Fri Sep 09 12:24:23 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars io addirittura preferisco The Lamb Lies Down, e incontro il disappunto di molti fan dei Genesis quando lo dico. Per me √®-
774220944730628100,Fri Sep 09 12:20:32 +0000 2016,Gaga and Florence together is honestly a dream. I've hoped it would've happened for a long time üòçüòç
774220311751487500,Fri Sep 09 12:18:01 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars √® chiaro che rimangono dei SIGNORI dischi rispetto alla maggior parte della musica pubblicata oggigiorno.

774212296491036700,Fri Sep 09 11:46:10 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars anche i Queen nel periodo "dance" hanno prodotto delle oscenit√†. E I Genesis dopo A Trick of the Tail sono calati e molto.

774211164733575200,Fri Sep 09 11:41:40 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars ma chiunque ha sfornato canzoni orrende e esibizioni inguardabili. Vuoi dire che Never Let Me Down √® un buon album?

774210594459230200,Fri Sep 09 11:39:24 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars ma ad una che ha 275 milioni in banca, che differenza faceva? Come se a me mi offrissero 5 euro per cantare una sua canzone.
774210361427984400,Fri Sep 09 11:38:28 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars ti ringrazio e ti faccio presente che il mio "piccolo" non √® inferiore al tuo üòé. Mi piacerebbe sapere cosa pensi di Madonna

774209937836761100,Fri Sep 09 11:36:47 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars ma poteva mai rendere davvero omaggio in modo completo ed esauriente ad un simile artista in 7 minuti scarsi?

774206105429958700,Fri Sep 09 11:21:34 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars io sono daccordo con te, ma i puritani indecente lo ritenevano. La percezione dell'arte dipende dallo spirito della gente
774205052089200600,Fri Sep 09 11:17:23 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars sempre dopo decenni purtroppo.
774205002743214100,Fri Sep 09 11:17:11 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars ma questo lo dici tu, anche Bowie era considerato "indecente" per come si vestiva negli anni 70. La genialit√† si apprezza-
774204796509249500,Fri Sep 09 11:16:22 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars e to assicuro che si possono amare entrambi, sia Bowie che Gaga. Proprio domani vado a vedere la sua mostra a Bologna üòç

774204262637330400,Fri Sep 09 11:14:14 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars si tratta di scelte diverse. Stai paragonando un'artista che ha ancora tanto da dimostrare a delle leggende assolute
774203730065494000,Fri Sep 09 11:12:07 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars la pop dance anni 80 ha im numerose canzoni una progressione degli accordi molto simile. Sono serissimo
774203463664275500,Fri Sep 09 11:11:04 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars non lo ascolto a dire la verit√†. Preferisco Lou Reed (Transformer primo in assoluto) e i Velvet Underground

774203043990609900,Fri Sep 09 11:09:24 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars te lo giuro. La nonna era cugina di quinto grado del padre di mio nonno, abruzzese anche lui naturalmente
774202653035364400,Fri Sep 09 11:07:51 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars nessuna somiglianza se non la progressione degli accordi, che per√≤ √® simile in buona parte delle canzoni pop-dance degli 80
774202449204748300,Fri Sep 09 11:07:02 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars Adoro anche Madonna, credici o no √® una mia lontana parente quindi avrei pi√π che un motivo per difenderla. Non ho mai notato

774200559586906100,Fri Sep 09 10:59:32 +0000 2016,@Silvia_on_Mars io adoro anche i Queen,  Pink Floyd, Genesis, Radiohead, Yes e Led Zeppelin. Se non ti piace non vuol dire che faccia schifo
