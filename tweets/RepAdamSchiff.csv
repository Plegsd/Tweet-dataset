811967688360808400,Thu Dec 22 16:12:37 +0000 2016,The only way out of this box is to fully divest. Trump has said he doesn’t care about his business interests anymore. Time to prove it.
811967171828084700,Thu Dec 22 16:10:34 +0000 2016,Turning day to day management over to children doesn't solve problem. “Princelings” are a feature of many kleptocracies around the world.
811966800082636800,Thu Dec 22 16:09:05 +0000 2016,Imagine if Trump's gratitude or anger bleeds out – muddying America's foreign policy in ways that elude accountability.
811966322401800200,Thu Dec 22 16:07:11 +0000 2016,What if a country pays fair market price to stay in a Trump hotel? Not good enough. The Clause prohibits payment even for services rendered.

811965680824238100,Thu Dec 22 16:04:38 +0000 2016,Foreign states will tread carefully around Trump’s private interests, hoping to avoid his wrath and curry favor. We've seen this already.
811965082662031400,Thu Dec 22 16:02:15 +0000 2016,Given Trump’s lack of transparency on taxes and business interests, many of these potential conflicts will be hidden from public.
811964776955912200,Thu Dec 22 16:01:03 +0000 2016,Trump’s very attached to his businesses. Easy to imagine he'll be affected by his own perceptions of how countries deal with his company.
811964588367417300,Thu Dec 22 16:00:18 +0000 2016,There’s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS – including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment.
811964252470857700,Thu Dec 22 15:58:58 +0000 2016,It simply provides that no federal office holder can accept payment from a foreign nation without the explicit approval of Congress.
811964141753790500,Thu Dec 22 15:58:31 +0000 2016,The Emoluments Clause isn’t well known, but it was very important to the Framers who worried about foreign influence in a young Republic.
811963776425672700,Thu Dec 22 15:57:04 +0000 2016,Trump must divest completely to prevent conflicts of interest. Why?   The Constitution's Emoluments Clause. What’s that? Let me explain:
