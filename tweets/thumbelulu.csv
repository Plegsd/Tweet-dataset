864934894886993900,Wed May 17 20:05:23 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig that's so intense. I agree this is prob a longer in person conversation.
864934152155443200,Wed May 17 20:02:26 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig yep. I share similar judgments and shame and disgust. Yet I love them

864932723919536100,Wed May 17 19:56:45 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig his shame feels pretty clear to me. I don't agree with all his actions but I do understand his shame
864932558852587500,Wed May 17 19:56:06 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig well. It's truth. Humanity can definitely be pretty horrifying. That's not new information...
864932362684997600,Wed May 17 19:55:19 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig it's not about whether or not you care she's a doctor. The fact is, she was. Abusers aren't what we think they are
864932145478877200,Wed May 17 19:54:27 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig sorry I don't agree with this statement. All things need to be contextualized otherwise we lose the nuance and have stereotypes

864931082314973200,Wed May 17 19:50:14 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig I'm not sure who's saying that any of it is "ok". It's a story. It raises questions, no one is attaching a concise answer
864930320151228400,Wed May 17 19:47:12 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig the love there is beautiful. And complicated. Like many things in life.
864930067113099300,Wed May 17 19:46:12 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig it's all relative. He could have chosen to never write it and bury it with his death. I'm not here to take measure of courage.
864929824044757000,Wed May 17 19:45:14 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig I don't think it's fair to criticize his death? But no you're right...the world isn't fair in the way it doles out consequences
864929411669180400,Wed May 17 19:43:36 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig you're right. It doesn't detract from the horror at all. It's possible to be both awful and conflicted and courageous,is it not?
864929204323795000,Wed May 17 19:42:46 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig yes and it's happening all over the world. This story is too common and maybe the exposure of it will bring it to light
864929037113630700,Wed May 17 19:42:06 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig the biggest disappointment is that Lola herself can't tell her story - a real damn shame when oppressors control the narrative
864928479120314400,Wed May 17 19:39:53 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig if we are truly to put ourselves in someone's shoes, we have to know we don't know everything.

864928164815921200,Wed May 17 19:38:38 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig in some cultures it is. Betrayal to family is a greater sin than anything else. But that's besides the point....
864927963367616500,Wed May 17 19:37:50 +0000 2017,@minhalbaig certainly but why not look at intentions of the author? To expose this shameful secret. He's not claiming to have been "right"
