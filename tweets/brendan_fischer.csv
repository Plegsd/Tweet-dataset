911036657666871300,Fri Sep 22 01:17:20 +0000 2017,and anyway Facebook still needs to release the 3000+ ads. But at least they claim to now be taking this stuff seriously.
911035986133610500,Fri Sep 22 01:14:39 +0000 2017,Facebook could make it simple to include a disclaimer, or even set up an alert to tell users when their spending may implicate FEC reporting
911035670084427800,Fri Sep 22 01:13:24 +0000 2017,Given the ease with which Facebook ads can be bought, it could provide a real service to its users by making it easy to comply with the law
911035469961596900,Fri Sep 22 01:12:36 +0000 2017,Will Facebook monitor political ads to assess whether the purchase is coming from outside the country, or using foreign currency?
911035357864628200,Fri Sep 22 01:12:10 +0000 2017,Facebook has long fought to treat political ads just like it treats commercial ads, which helped create some of these problems.
911035255544574000,Fri Sep 22 01:11:45 +0000 2017,Facebook is also going to "strengthen our ad review process for political ads." That's good. https://t.co/croQXG6EsP
911034809010524200,Fri Sep 22 01:09:59 +0000 2017,(and it goes without saying that knowing which page paid for the Facebook ad isn't the same as telling you where the money came from)
911034464574337000,Fri Sep 22 01:08:37 +0000 2017,Apparently that is no longer the case (and probably never was). But will the disclaimers Facebook is talking about provide the same info?
911034184914935800,Fri Sep 22 01:07:30 +0000 2017,In 2011 Facebook told the FEC it was “impracticable” to include a disclaimer stating who paid for a political ad  https://t.co/6bXcppTMFa
