586951809467461600,Sat Apr 11 17:59:51 +0000 2015,@anandc When the infrastructure you run on becomes a marketing platform, it creates unfair opportunities for companies.

586947801327611900,Sat Apr 11 17:43:55 +0000 2015,@anandc So it is for ongoing app usage. Original question: how do you think new ecom players will compete with big ones?
586947137197314000,Sat Apr 11 17:41:17 +0000 2015,@anandc Sorry. I lost you here. Is it for ongoing app usage? If yes, then your logic of 60% less cost per user acquired doesn't hold.
586946413998637000,Sat Apr 11 17:38:24 +0000 2015,@anandc So Airtel Zero is only for app downloads (i.e. customer acquisition)? Or ongoing app usage as well?
586945995520344000,Sat Apr 11 17:36:44 +0000 2015,@anandc I think you are reiterating what I said. Apps which have $$ will have users. Users won't access the free internet (e.g. Wikipedia)
586945227593617400,Sat Apr 11 17:33:41 +0000 2015,@anandc IMO, Airtel Zero's cost is prohibitive for any early startup. How do you think new ecom players will compete with the big ones?
586944552059080700,Sat Apr 11 17:31:00 +0000 2015,@anandc Then apps which have $$ will get popular. Then, govt will get into their businesses to control what people learn. Keep it fair.
