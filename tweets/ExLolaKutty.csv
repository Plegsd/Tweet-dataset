566261682976981000,Fri Feb 13 15:44:40 +0000 2015,Staying at a resort is a sad reminder of the fact that we are an unattractive species. Because you encounter OTHER people staying there.

564359871319900160,Sun Feb 08 09:47:33 +0000 2015,In a post parsi wedding food coma. There should be a word for gluttony. Oh ya- gluttony.
564319424790802400,Sun Feb 08 07:06:50 +0000 2015,Yesterday at a parsi wedding I was asked : has anyone ever told you you have a striking resemblance to lolakutty? No really. It's uncanny.
564305556878290940,Sun Feb 08 06:11:43 +0000 2015,@gkhamba thanks to you, I'm half expecting bill burr to enter Andrews tomorrow with 'dil bur' playing in the background. &amp;did he doesn't -üò¢

563920195517829100,Sat Feb 07 04:40:26 +0000 2015,@absolutelydanny men dressed as women just fatigue me. One running gag for four minutes. Mine eyes mine eyes ....üò£
563918277294829600,Sat Feb 07 04:32:49 +0000 2015,An ad for a port has a woman golfer swinging a club atop a container vessel. Their tag line: 'Think inside the box.' Im thinking ...WHAT?
563650386574077950,Fri Feb 06 10:48:18 +0000 2015,@raghavmandava FYI mildly creepy that you need specific geographical location!
563585301197504500,Fri Feb 06 06:29:41 +0000 2015,Nothing like the appearance of a zit to cheer you up before an important meeting ! Acne wants to be friends again after years. Thanks. NOT.
563143874562900000,Thu Feb 05 01:15:37 +0000 2015,@thevirdas what happened to traipsing off to undisclosed beach location on a whim?
562787792099766300,Wed Feb 04 01:40:40 +0000 2015,From Je Suis Charlie to Je Suis AIB apparently. The fracas is laughable &amp; inconceivable &amp; real. This wasn't a #knockout anyone saw coming.
562493858047479800,Tue Feb 03 06:12:41 +0000 2015,I tried to keep the girls away from you @KaviShastri ... But couldn't! http://t.co/j7YcC7KEzY

561401298168184800,Sat Jan 31 05:51:14 +0000 2015,My two year old is obsessed with a "jhadoo."  I'm worried.  What's next?  Khejriwal's scarf?
561400613875896300,Sat Jan 31 05:48:31 +0000 2015,I don't understand how a "bath" is a chore for the male species. Or how they easily "forget" to have one...simply by forgetting to have one.
561399806161993700,Sat Jan 31 05:45:18 +0000 2015,Just realised I haven't got photos "developed" in ages!  The joys of not knowing what you would look like. Technology ruins simple joys...
561399020120068100,Sat Jan 31 05:42:11 +0000 2015,RT @thevirdas: We're almost outta tickets for #WeirdassPajama Delhi on Sunday Feb 1st :-)) Get em fast at http://t.co/ZminN3woSJ http://t.c‚Ä¶

560730757975380000,Thu Jan 29 09:26:45 +0000 2015,Delhi. You are our capital city. You support so many worthless causes. It's time to support a worthy one. http://t.co/jCCVLdizXt
