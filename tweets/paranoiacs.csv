1237068694464987100,Mon Mar 09 17:32:15 +0000 2020,@Unmikely I never tire of it either. And, darkly, an apocalyptic album worthy of the moment.

1236710233197641700,Sun Mar 08 17:47:51 +0000 2020,@dfmcilroy I know. Staggering stuff.
1236710100582183000,Sun Mar 08 17:47:19 +0000 2020,@CKndestroy My personal favorite is Pour Down Like Silver, but Shoot Out The Lights is certainly very great and a good starting point.
