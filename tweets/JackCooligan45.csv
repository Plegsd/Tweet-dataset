550891079290355700,Fri Jan 02 05:47:23 +0000 2015,Hey @mark_may what were you saying about "when the chips are on the table the SEC handles its business?" Then you claimed Bama was the SEC.
550885905226293250,Fri Jan 02 05:26:49 +0000 2015,Wow, down 14 with 3 minutes left? Who let these BAMA guys in? Am I right @TCU_Athletics?

550839811607896060,Fri Jan 02 02:23:39 +0000 2015,Winston just said "I don't plan on dying today" in a press conference. So basically was as good as I thought it would be.
550832687913918460,Fri Jan 02 01:55:21 +0000 2015,And coming up next we hav- Yeah yeah yeah, MAKE WINSTON ANSWER QUESTIONS!
550828612812017660,Fri Jan 02 01:39:09 +0000 2015,@oaknd1 not only that, but this game has a post game presser in which both teams will have to talk.

550826162856149000,Fri Jan 02 01:29:25 +0000 2015,You may have quit on the game, but please don't take out Winston. I. want. MORE!
550822320454246400,Fri Jan 02 01:14:09 +0000 2015,They went for it on 4th down and got a touchdown because sometimes the universe just wants to make everyone happy.
550820725750530050,Fri Jan 02 01:07:49 +0000 2015,There is no way 2015 can go anywhere but down from here. This is the mountain top.

550816985433788400,Fri Jan 02 00:52:57 +0000 2015,ESPN was right, this FSU defense looks REALLY fast chasing Oregon's receivers into the end zone.
550815538457616400,Fri Jan 02 00:47:12 +0000 2015,Can someone please explain what contacts are to that man??? I'm tired of seeing Winston squinting all the time.

550768254948765700,Thu Jan 01 21:39:19 +0000 2015,Well now, the kicker getting vaporized on that blocked FG has a little more significance doesn't it?
550406008250839040,Wed Dec 31 21:39:53 +0000 2014,@jsnyderrr3 it's absurd they didn't take the QB injury into consideration. It's about the best teams, not who "deserves" it most.
550403786033090560,Wed Dec 31 21:31:03 +0000 2014,@jsnyderrr3 it doesn't make sense. Unfairly punishing the BIG12 for not having a championship. Completely out of their control.
550393504112070660,Wed Dec 31 20:50:11 +0000 2014,Let's all remember this game tomorrow when FSU (and most likely OSU) gets smacked and think about what could have been.
