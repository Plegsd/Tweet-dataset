727547202944397300,Tue May 03 17:15:45 +0000 2016,@bucksexton #teambuck #NeverTrump #NeverKasich No way in hell I will vote for ANYONE other than Cruz!  The GOPe is DOA with any candidate.
727546783019102200,Tue May 03 17:14:04 +0000 2016,@bucksexton #teambuck #NeverTrump NO way in hell  GOP consolidates behind Trump!  Won't happen!  Hell can freeze over, I'm not voting Trump.
727546298316910600,Tue May 03 17:12:09 +0000 2016,@bucksexton #teambuck #NeverTrump  If Cruz loses today it'll be tough, but I'm still dying in place!  Not sure Trump gets to 1237 regardless

727542947156107300,Tue May 03 16:58:50 +0000 2016,@meggymish @DanDLionPatriot @BuckSexton I suspect w'll see a push to get behind the Libertarian party &amp; to ensure voting down ticket races!
727541200052351000,Tue May 03 16:51:53 +0000 2016,@DanDLionPatriot @BuckSexton I agree with you, although, I'll probably vote Libertarian, however, I think there'll be those who are fed up.
727539869249990700,Tue May 03 16:46:36 +0000 2016,@bucksexton #teambuck #NeverTrump  If Trump wins the nomination we might well loose the house &amp; or senate, becuase so many will stay home!

725779776036728800,Thu Apr 28 20:12:37 +0000 2016,@Jay_Severin, I think that Trump &amp; Hillary are Both Leftists! BOTH corrupt! BOTH Totalitarian!  Both will destroy individual freedom!!!
725775221311963100,Thu Apr 28 19:54:31 +0000 2016,Forgiven, @Jay_Severin but I don't see the difference. They're two sides of the same coin. If the GOP goes Trump - I'll campagin aginst them

725385277405954000,Wed Apr 27 18:05:01 +0000 2016,@kristinhock @BuckSexton You were correct. I'll do everything I can to torpedo Trump. I'd bet my paycheck Cruz would never would never do it

722133846871773200,Mon Apr 18 18:45:00 +0000 2016,@grorc Yep!  I've been watching CNN which isn't great, but Megyn could really help a network take market share from Fox.
722132855095042000,Mon Apr 18 18:41:03 +0000 2016,Yeah, @grorc, that was a bit much, but I am focusing on Fox's decline in the market.  It is a huge opening for someone to fill that gap.
