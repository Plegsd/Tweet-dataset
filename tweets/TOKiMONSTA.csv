873183976281620500,Fri Jun 09 14:24:17 +0000 2017,so if you want a good stereo mix wo things getting muddy, you can try doing side channel eqing and reducing side channel compression.
873183246946713600,Fri Jun 09 14:21:23 +0000 2017,Heavy energy in the center of a mix ( kick, snare, bass) causes compressor to kick in--which squashes the wider/ spatial stuff in the mix.
873182502394908700,Fri Jun 09 14:18:26 +0000 2017,If compressor struggs to reduce dynamic range w.o squashing the signal, use a Mid/Side compressor to apply less comp. to the side channel.
873181389406912500,Fri Jun 09 14:14:00 +0000 2017,mid/side eq-ing - "If a mix sounds muddy, try reducing low frequencies in the side channel with a low shelf filter."
