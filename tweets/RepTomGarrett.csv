827913417310732300,Sat Feb 04 16:15:15 +0000 2017,@awelch744 thank u for your support. I've never been afraid to stand against leadership and assure u I won't start now - when they are wrong
827912784281210900,Sat Feb 04 16:12:44 +0000 2017,@doc527 @EdWorkforce do you follow anything? Floor speeches? Press releases? All due respect I've explained repeatedly..
827567363943960600,Fri Feb 03 17:20:09 +0000 2017,Check out my comments during yesterday's @EdWorkforce hearing with regard to school choice.  https://t.co/02M64Dhr2z https://t.co/23FmlOVWDq
827266198903545900,Thu Feb 02 21:23:26 +0000 2017,Happy to see @thehill pick up my opinion piece. I stand with @TulsiPress https://t.co/8cjvlyKKDs  #StopArmingTerrorists Act
827264553914241000,Thu Feb 02 21:16:54 +0000 2017,@tnofuentes especially as the world grows more dangerous and ISIS continues to threaten using this program as a stream for infilitration
827264352893833200,Thu Feb 02 21:16:06 +0000 2017,@tnofuentes aren't these questions we should start having? Not blocking altogether, but what keeps homeland safe and encourages immigration?
827262445529944000,Thu Feb 02 21:08:31 +0000 2017,@SallyLHudson @backyardconserv https://t.co/6xmsLlZxj2 I appreciate both sides of the debate but my first responsibility is ensuring HomeSec
827260788419145700,Thu Feb 02 21:01:56 +0000 2017,@SallyLHudson @backyardconserv I want to avoid the "what if." I feel as if it is a matter of time and would rather enhance screenings now.
827258886881108000,Thu Feb 02 20:54:23 +0000 2017,@tnofuentes but at what point should we say ok with the status quo? That works fine, until something happens.. trying to avoid the "what if"
827258413998497800,Thu Feb 02 20:52:30 +0000 2017,@EvanWas8 @Reuters would like to see more details as they unfold. As a Veteran this is a particularly sensitive issue with me.
827257921687822300,Thu Feb 02 20:50:32 +0000 2017,@backyardconserv @ProfessorBec always happy to engage on issues. Unfortunately the discourse this week has been far from legitimate debate.
827257259117776900,Thu Feb 02 20:47:54 +0000 2017,@tnofuentes but the general concept for slowing the process temporarily and strengthening protections is something I support.
827257100413739000,Thu Feb 02 20:47:17 +0000 2017,@tnofuentes when FBI and DHS officials are 100% confident in the process I will be convinced. The rollout with this had many flaws, I agree.
827256767822258200,Thu Feb 02 20:45:57 +0000 2017,@stevekenning @lanalana did you read my recent opinion piece on Syria?
827251130941968400,Thu Feb 02 20:23:33 +0000 2017,@tnofuentes it is a temporary pause. I have always embraced legal immigration. Ensuring the process in place is adequate is common sense.
827241320502665200,Thu Feb 02 19:44:34 +0000 2017,@lanalana @brianrvincent looking forward to those as well. Details on a schedule for them are forthcoming.
827241004042506200,Thu Feb 02 19:43:19 +0000 2017,@ProfessorBec @realDonaldTrump @POTUS it says that I am not afraid to support nat'l security promises made to VA5 over the past 12 months.
827240662135353300,Thu Feb 02 19:41:57 +0000 2017,@brianrvincent @lanalana Thank you for calling our office. If you left your information you will be getting a reply on your concerns.
827238540937412600,Thu Feb 02 19:33:32 +0000 2017,@lanalana who is disregarding them? We have official outlets to log concerns and get replies.
827238145590706200,Thu Feb 02 19:31:57 +0000 2017,@desconcentrado understand that concern over harsh campaign rhetoric. However, I feel it is misleading to call this a "muslim ban"
827230472807804900,Thu Feb 02 19:01:28 +0000 2017,@lanalana was never a part of that process during my tenure in the General Assembly. Issue that needs reform but I merely ran where I lived
827226258245374000,Thu Feb 02 18:44:43 +0000 2017,@lanalana üò•guess I should look for a safe space. Oh wait...
