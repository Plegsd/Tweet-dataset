508187359532167200,Sat Sep 06 09:38:02 +0000 2014,The difference between reverse and natural swing, reverse swings a lot later and is much harder to pick up. Very hard to start against
508186813643497500,Sat Sep 06 09:35:52 +0000 2014,Reverse swing in the 28th over, with 2x white balls this means it's really the 14th over.. Hopefully we get it swinging as well..
