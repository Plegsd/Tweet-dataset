924680726880010200,Sun Oct 29 16:53:59 +0000 2017,Bumrah’s 3/47 off 10 overs was no less valuable than Rohit Sharma’s 147. Me thinks. 👏👏👏
924635512886870000,Sun Oct 29 13:54:19 +0000 2017,Massive wicket that for India of Colin Munro. Thanks to the bravery of Chahal to toss that ball up to a power hitter. Brilliant 👏👏👏
924606890901774300,Sun Oct 29 12:00:35 +0000 2017,Many shots played in tht score of 337 were out of character for the Indians. NZ as a rule don’t bowl where you like it. Excellent from Ind!
924530950779760600,Sun Oct 29 06:58:50 +0000 2017,I’ve seen nothing to suggest that Bumrah cannot be a game changer in Tests too. It’s just a matter of when he gets the chance.

866296390586126300,Sun May 21 14:15:29 +0000 2017,Right choice by MI to bat first. Considering that their reliable strength has been bowling. Put the stronger forte under pressure. #MIvRPS

845621751031578600,Sat Mar 25 13:01:50 +0000 2017,Kuldeep Yadav is a pure, classical leg spinner in every way. Just that he does it left handed.  #INDvAUS
845476162939826200,Sat Mar 25 03:23:20 +0000 2017,Brave selection by India. One batsman short. Third spinner perhaps backup for tired/tiring Ashwin &amp; Jadeja. #IndvAus
845474626377535500,Sat Mar 25 03:17:13 +0000 2017,Saw him in the under 19 WC 3 years back. Became an instant fan. Great to see Kuldeep Yadav become the 288th Test player for India.

838249923955032000,Sun Mar 05 04:48:50 +0000 2017,If Ashwin finds comfort bowling over the wicket to left handers, we have a match on our hands.Aus have 6 left handers. Terrific day so far!

721717416963612700,Sun Apr 17 15:10:15 +0000 2016,No one gives more access &amp; freedom for the bat to come down to hit the ball like AB does. No part of his body ever comes in its way.
721598990475595800,Sun Apr 17 07:19:40 +0000 2016,Am liking the Gujarat Lions. A team of seasoned T20 players, suited for all kinds of pitches expected this IPL. #IPL2016
721338977043685400,Sat Apr 16 14:06:28 +0000 2016,That was fun to hear. Suresh Raina at the toss - One change in our team, Jadeja not playing because he is getting married. #MIvGL
720857718144118800,Fri Apr 15 06:14:07 +0000 2016,Wondering...should I have the boiled egg or the pouched egg? https://t.co/s3ePHCf9JV
720645439138046000,Thu Apr 14 16:10:36 +0000 2016,Super death bowler vs super death batsman. Dhoni won that against Bravo. #IPL2016 #GLvRPS
720146115643834400,Wed Apr 13 07:06:28 +0000 2016,I join thousands others in praying for a normal healthy life for James Taylor, albeit not as a player anymore. May god give him strength.
719962890514501600,Tue Apr 12 18:58:24 +0000 2016,SRH must quickly create climate for Kane Williamson or Morgan to blossom. Or it will be mostly left to David Warner to win games for them.
719921747424718800,Tue Apr 12 16:14:54 +0000 2016,On a batting venue it will be batsmen in the spotlight. So my man was Mustafizur Rehman. On debut, brilliant once again. #IPL2016 #RCBvSRH
719910801591545900,Tue Apr 12 15:31:25 +0000 2016,Drop everything &amp; watch this ! AB &amp; Virat are in full flow. #IPL2016 #RCBvSRH
719891832243552300,Tue Apr 12 14:16:02 +0000 2016,Just learnt that Chris Gayle has 17 hundreds in T20 cricket. That's phenomenal! Watch him tonight play on his favourite ground.#RCBvSRH
719891255191142400,Tue Apr 12 14:13:44 +0000 2016,Really happy for Mustafizur who makes his IPL debut tonight. Gayle, Virat, AB , Watson are some of the batsmen he will be bowling to.
719778469899411500,Tue Apr 12 06:45:34 +0000 2016,Quite amused Harsha retweeted that the current IPL commentary team is like a pizza without toppings.
719237627489230800,Sun Apr 10 18:56:27 +0000 2016,Form of Gambhir was the best news that came out for KKR tonight. His form as batsman is crucial for KKR's success this season. #IPL2016

719049423066517500,Sun Apr 10 06:28:36 +0000 2016,So thoughtful of Grand Oberoi, Kolkata, to do this. https://t.co/JAlSztuh9o
718853208395763700,Sat Apr 09 17:28:55 +0000 2016,Mumbai crowd would take that defeat in their stride, that it was a Mumbai boy Rahane who did the Mumbai Indians in tonight. #IPL2016
718842615676870700,Sat Apr 09 16:46:49 +0000 2016,Danny is in the house ladies &amp; gentlemen!  T20 commentary panel incomplete without him, that's for sure. #IPL2016 https://t.co/iFavxdT5Qw

716681601422196700,Sun Apr 03 17:39:43 +0000 2016,Brathwaite may have singlehandedly destroyed the philosophy of bowling Yorkers in the death. Scored 28 off 5 attempted Yorkers. #WT20
716676266641006600,Sun Apr 03 17:18:31 +0000 2016,4 of the 5 wins in this tournament came without the Gayle contribution. 'Team Windies' wins the WT20 2016.
716673131222540300,Sun Apr 03 17:06:04 +0000 2016,We have power &amp; that's all you need in this game!!says WI. Incredible WI ! Incredible finals! incredible tournament !  #WT20Final
716646999404200000,Sun Apr 03 15:22:13 +0000 2016,England was rebuilding right through that innings, weren't they? That may have got them to be 30 runs short. We'll see. #WT20Final
716618080252727300,Sun Apr 03 13:27:19 +0000 2016,Brand new pitch for the finals. Forget about low scores on this one. Short boundary on one side.All points to a high scoring game.#WT20Final
716596511908446200,Sun Apr 03 12:01:36 +0000 2016,England is the better team but WI winning would be so much more fun😀 #WT20Final
716505285649522700,Sun Apr 03 05:59:06 +0000 2016,Wankhede was a tough place to captain if you lost the toss. Morgan &amp; Faf, as captains, struggled to defend 182 &amp; 229 respectively.
716502870804201500,Sun Apr 03 05:49:31 +0000 2016,Blaming Dhoni's captaincy for India's loss at the Wankhede is either opportunism or shows a poor understanding of the game. #WT20

715555822634410000,Thu Mar 31 15:06:17 +0000 2016,Just one 6 to have a strike rate of almost 190 is rare. That's what Virat is, rare. And yes, a bit lucky tonight😀 #WT20
715554115196158000,Thu Mar 31 14:59:30 +0000 2016,After Lara, Virat is the best that I have seen who can play breathtaking ground shots, crucially in the gaps. #WT20 #INDvsWI
715540468679966700,Thu Mar 31 14:05:16 +0000 2016,Surprised India dropped Shikhar. His kind of pitch, his kind of attack.  #WT20 #INDvsWI
715440775538942000,Thu Mar 31 07:29:07 +0000 2016,India obviously are strong favourites. Small size of the ground &amp; what one big guy can do on such grounds, only concern for India. #WT20
715238217105039400,Wed Mar 30 18:04:14 +0000 2016,Manish Pandey a better number 5 option than Rahane in T20s hence should replace Yuvi tomorrow.  #WT20 #IndvsWI
715234791038197800,Wed Mar 30 17:50:37 +0000 2016,NZ should have given Eng a heavy dose of spin in the first 10 overs. Jason Roy faced the 1st ball from Sodhi when he was on 49. #WT20

714818203516608500,Tue Mar 29 14:15:15 +0000 2016,That win against Aus was perhaps the 1st time in Ind cricket when fitness was the main contributor. Namely Dhoni &amp; Virat's running.#WT20
714398858076291100,Mon Mar 28 10:28:55 +0000 2016,Spoke to Dilip Vengsarkar today, If former International stalwarts are also floored by Virat, means we saw something special last night.
714314620987510800,Mon Mar 28 04:54:11 +0000 2016,One big improvement area for Ind cricket was one of the main ingredient of last night's win. Running between the wkts. It was phenomenal!
714157591971045400,Sun Mar 27 18:30:12 +0000 2016,Amidst Virat's euphoria let's not forget the contribution of Ashish Nehra in this critical win for India. #WT20 #INDvAUS

714117768547811300,Sun Mar 27 15:51:58 +0000 2016,It's a cool evening here in Mohali. If that has an effect on the pitch India should get this. #WT20 #IndvsAus
714108371385901000,Sun Mar 27 15:14:37 +0000 2016,Big, big wicket that of Maxwell. He would have taken the game away from Ind. Superb delivery from Bumrah to get rid of a real danger man.
714096103877058600,Sun Mar 27 14:25:53 +0000 2016,Brilliant that from Nehra ji. 3 overs for 16 runs while batsmen were on a rampage. #WT20 #INDvAUS
714090465663000600,Sun Mar 27 14:03:28 +0000 2016,Thought team winning the toss would want to bat 2nd here under lights, cool evening too. Aus may have made a mistake here. #WT20
714031869227110400,Sun Mar 27 10:10:38 +0000 2016,Had a look at the pitch for tonight's game in Mohali. My reading - It will turn, but best batting surface for Ind in the super 10. #WT20
713794525844475900,Sat Mar 26 18:27:31 +0000 2016,The best game of the tournament for me purely because of the amazing SL recovery. How good was Angelo!! #WT20 #ENGvSL

712695133129588700,Wed Mar 23 17:38:55 +0000 2016,Whatever happens, that was a terrific 19th over from a young cricketer under pressure. Well done Bumrah!

635097332481028100,Sat Aug 22 14:32:58 +0000 2015,It's a bowling performance that Ind should be proud of. SL had the best use of the surface &amp; India had them all out for 306 #INDvsSL

634664241945940000,Fri Aug 21 09:52:01 +0000 2015,One big positive on this tour of SL is the emergence of Rahane as a top class close catcher. #INDvsSL
634663925095661600,Fri Aug 21 09:50:45 +0000 2015,Sanga tentative right through the series against Ashwin. Out to him again. Ashiwn should be really proud of this. #INDvsSL

634221291495559200,Thu Aug 20 04:31:53 +0000 2015,Disappointed to see India dump the much talked about 5 bowler theory so quickly. Binny at best a batting all rounder. #IndvSL
