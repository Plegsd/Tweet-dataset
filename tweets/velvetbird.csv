426418733469294600,Thu Jan 23 18:18:43 +0000 2014,Unless I am feeding her in my sleep... we slept through the whole night!! I'm talking 9+ hours!!!
426120632405745660,Wed Jan 22 22:34:10 +0000 2014,@powersurf no, but I need to I think!
426115962903883800,Wed Jan 22 22:15:37 +0000 2014,@powersurf well don't buy one from them, that's my lesson! I just want the most dummy proof option
426115806301151200,Wed Jan 22 22:14:59 +0000 2014,@powersurf and Peter has to fix it for me all the time, ha ha.
426115483511709700,Wed Jan 22 22:13:42 +0000 2014,@powersurf I originally bought my domain through Wordpress, thinking I would switch from blogger. I didn't &amp; now it messes up all the time
426101529779523600,Wed Jan 22 21:18:15 +0000 2014,@arrowandapple @danihampton @sollybabywrap I chose poorly!!
426099198031712260,Wed Jan 22 21:09:00 +0000 2014,@arrowandapple it really is!! And not stretchy enough for a wiggly baby! We need something else!
426097168621912060,Wed Jan 22 21:00:56 +0000 2014,Are the solly wraps really thin and stretchy? It looks it, compared to the moby. The moby just feels like a lot of fabric on my short self!
426090102344126460,Wed Jan 22 20:32:51 +0000 2014,The many faces of Remy. http://t.co/Plkv3h98zT

425744071240327200,Tue Jan 21 21:37:51 +0000 2014,@powersurf @PeterRollo is godaddy okay? I'm transferring my domain so it actually works for once!
425679255842742300,Tue Jan 21 17:20:17 +0000 2014,Someone now wakes up in the morning not to eat, but just to wiggle and laugh. Weird, but fine by me.
425677254660591600,Tue Jan 21 17:12:20 +0000 2014,@tessfine ha! No wonder I don't eat meat anymore
425519677486288900,Tue Jan 21 06:46:11 +0000 2014,@xochiana ha ha, yes! Hmm no wonder I grew up thinking meat was gross
425512019534430200,Tue Jan 21 06:15:45 +0000 2014,@landondmise probably tastes about the same
425495566735249400,Tue Jan 21 05:10:23 +0000 2014,@danihampton its the hip version of the wine glass on the mattress commercials!

423282944740839400,Wed Jan 15 02:38:12 +0000 2014,@arrowandapple I think it just makes you feel better and normal when your baby cries!
423281291853705200,Wed Jan 15 02:31:38 +0000 2014,@DelightTacky @jenloveskev I just know inanity would KILL me right now, not in the good way! I need to get this now!
423279352696950800,Wed Jan 15 02:23:56 +0000 2014,@jenloveskev ha ha, does it just kill you? I need an after baby workout, but insanity just takes so long! 25 mind sounds easy in comparison!
423278129990225900,Wed Jan 15 02:19:04 +0000 2014,@jenloveskev I was just thinking about asking you about t25!
423274949478862850,Wed Jan 15 02:06:26 +0000 2014,@arrowandapple she showed me this chart http://t.co/32j29mI2GE
423274131837042700,Wed Jan 15 02:03:11 +0000 2014,@arrowandapple you've got this! Our pediatrician said the peak of crying is at two months, after that it tapers off!

423179562868940800,Tue Jan 14 19:47:24 +0000 2014,I have never ever been a breakfast skipper, but recently I turned into one. What a bad habit!
423142481249570800,Tue Jan 14 17:20:03 +0000 2014,@arrowandapple it's been my biggest fear!! But mom instincts kicked in or something, and she was fine and I held her like normal!
423018332208373760,Tue Jan 14 09:06:44 +0000 2014,Mom tweet. We were gifted some honest co diapers, and crud they really are so nice&amp;work so well. No more blowouts! There goes all our money
422967738881941500,Tue Jan 14 05:45:41 +0000 2014,Fell outside while carrying Remy tonight. She was fine! I just scraped a knee. But I think @Garrett__Holmes almost pooped his pants
421752215284351000,Fri Jan 10 21:15:38 +0000 2014,Over a week later and we still aren't even close to being unpacked, sheesh! It's like Remy is no help or something... Send coffee &amp; donuts!!

420570910144225300,Tue Jan 07 15:01:33 +0000 2014,Remy weighs a whole 9lbz 14 oz, putting her up there in the 12th percentile. Big and strong like her parents!

418594237978931200,Thu Jan 02 04:06:58 +0000 2014,@prettyandfun I'm excited for more space, but man I really loved living in a studio!
418593220637884400,Thu Jan 02 04:02:55 +0000 2014,Woah, I have a bedroom for the first time in a year and a half. Weird! I think I will really miss only living in one room, seriously.
418402107834634240,Wed Jan 01 15:23:30 +0000 2014,...so tired. Happy new year! Luckily all the loud drunk people running around outside until 5am helped us stay awake to pack!
418273602991956000,Wed Jan 01 06:52:52 +0000 2014,@emergingthought we are moving a whole 6 blocks away
418269744311963650,Wed Jan 01 06:37:32 +0000 2014,@emergingthought my mover is my husband&amp; friends we suckered in. I'm about to start indiscriminately tossing everything into boxes
418267397947023360,Wed Jan 01 06:28:13 +0000 2014,Why do we wait until the last 3 days to START packing!? It's looking like an all nighter is in order! Tomorrow the truck comes!!
418175043684671500,Wed Jan 01 00:21:14 +0000 2014,@darbycisneros oh! Sometimes they have really good deals on shoes.
418174967830695940,Wed Jan 01 00:20:56 +0000 2014,@darbycisneros that's what I do with amazon cards every time! It's too hard when you can get almost anything you want.
418149414373314560,Tue Dec 31 22:39:23 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple yes!! Also, we are moving tomorrow, HA! But have a few days to be completely out luckily

418148685763969000,Tue Dec 31 22:36:30 +0000 2013,@LaurensLoDown ha ha so apparently I looked extra gigantic or something!
418148590901415940,Tue Dec 31 22:36:07 +0000 2013,@LaurensLoDown I think just the "woah you're huge!" "You're about to pop any day now!" "Two months left? But you can't get any bigger!"
418138802700304400,Tue Dec 31 21:57:13 +0000 2013,Crossing my fingers as I walk into the kitchen to see if we have coffee. This house isn't going to pack itself!! Maddie and Remy are NO help
417916113440108540,Tue Dec 31 07:12:20 +0000 2013,@theericlemiere hmm I think if something is hot and tempting, who cares if it's pretty!

417530682303193100,Mon Dec 30 05:40:46 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow it's true!! We've only very briefly had one our whole marriage, it's going to be a whole new life!
417527071879876600,Mon Dec 30 05:26:25 +0000 2013,Sad to trade in our nice 1920's french doors, hardwood floors, and subway tile for carpet. But oh yeah, we get bedrooms and a DISHWASHER.
417192483466928100,Sun Dec 29 07:16:53 +0000 2013,@malwarning that's right!! And I can see our building from your building!
416336189759578100,Thu Dec 26 22:34:17 +0000 2013,@tessfine you did find a place though? Our new apartment is double the size, it'll take awhile to fill it up!
416335457861902340,Thu Dec 26 22:31:22 +0000 2013,@tessfine that's crazy!! And seems like it could make them pick other people over you guys!
416333723236196350,Thu Dec 26 22:24:29 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple YES!

416311328899207200,Thu Dec 26 20:55:30 +0000 2013,We are moving on Tuesday! Guess I better start packing. Should be easier than the last time we moved right after Christmas, from Georgia!
416309314346033150,Thu Dec 26 20:47:29 +0000 2013,Someone had Santa wrapped around their finger. She learned early who to suck up to. Until next year! http://t.co/Fzd8k7eANu

414892674194214900,Sun Dec 22 22:58:16 +0000 2013,@xochiana just like 8 blocks away! A maddie is allowed and there are bedrooms, we couldn't resist
414888707255054340,Sun Dec 22 22:42:30 +0000 2013,We are moving in a week, yikes! Luckily we have like 5 pieces of furniture. What will we fill our new 3 bedrooms with!?
413681802373378050,Thu Dec 19 14:46:42 +0000 2013,@tessfine it's a foreign concept to me! But one I would greatly benefit from right now, ha ha

409567765624668160,Sun Dec 08 06:18:59 +0000 2013,Turns out 13 days in bed is good for no one. I just about DIE walking up our 1 flight of stairs. I have the strength&amp;knees of an 80 year old

408992086860386300,Fri Dec 06 16:11:26 +0000 2013,@amberZonbie it's weird isn't it? And ago knew it would hurt so much after coming out!
408955552060821500,Fri Dec 06 13:46:16 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple im sleeping with this pillow! And they didn't say, but id imagine I'll feel a lot better each day. I'm just glad to be home!
408891352609337340,Fri Dec 06 09:31:09 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace that's how Remy was! We are having trouble finding the right formula for her tummy so I hope we go back to the no cry thing!
408885711043952640,Fri Dec 06 09:08:44 +0000 2013,P.s. This must be what it feels like to be stabbed! The tube in my back the second time around was big man. Like almost a bubble tea straw
408884057682890750,Fri Dec 06 09:02:10 +0000 2013,For real I don't know what I'd do without my @BumpNest pillow. Now it's helping me sleep with my uncomfortable post surgery ribs. I LOVE it

408107844265725950,Wed Dec 04 05:37:47 +0000 2013,Surgery went really well!! This was the last step to home, so this could be all over in a couple of days!
408005631728037900,Tue Dec 03 22:51:37 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple waiting to go into surgery righty now!

407643062395883500,Mon Dec 02 22:50:54 +0000 2013,It might be time to finally treat myself to an @giantdwarfshop crown. When all is said&amp;done I'll have like 22 hospital days since 10/25!
407624402793025540,Mon Dec 02 21:36:45 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights sheesh!! Bodies are so darn weird. And I hate being at the hospital but I am beyond grateful they exist!
407623574799675400,Mon Dec 02 21:33:28 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie they come and visit me for a lot of the day, luckily our house is like 5 minutes away.
407623214534123500,Mon Dec 02 21:32:02 +0000 2013,Sorry for my over tweeting this week, I'm bored out of my mind.
407623104198746100,Mon Dec 02 21:31:35 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie or a csection complication, they aren't sure. And she's good, she's had a week to party with dad in charge
407622646478561300,Mon Dec 02 21:29:46 +0000 2013,@clawandstitch ha! I don't even want to see diaper ads
407622469361467400,Mon Dec 02 21:29:04 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie some fluid in my lung just won't come out so they have go to in and take it out, bleh. But then I'm fixed!
407622284199743500,Mon Dec 02 21:28:20 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights complications from delivery got fluid in my lung that isn't draining out, so they have to go in and get it out
407581654178218000,Mon Dec 02 18:46:53 +0000 2013,I'm not so sick, so my surgery got pushed back until tomorrow for some emergencies. Annoying, but really glad I'm well enough to do that
407412234319450100,Mon Dec 02 07:33:40 +0000 2013,@powersurf now lets not get carried away
407411597615722500,Mon Dec 02 07:31:08 +0000 2013,@powersurf I like the sound of that!
407378369446035460,Mon Dec 02 05:19:06 +0000 2013,Surgery tomorrow and then all of this is over!! It is also not a majorly invasive surgery, just laparoscopic. Then home in a couple days!!
407377685531205600,Mon Dec 02 05:16:23 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace hooray!! I'm excited to experience the restful 3 hour sleeps. Turns out I was tired from not breathing, ha ha
407218765340758000,Sun Dec 01 18:44:54 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow oh my gosh @Quiet_Violet you are amazing!! I have a crappy attitude today and I'm not going through nearly what you are!
407167222042206200,Sun Dec 01 15:20:05 +0000 2013,Our Christmas tree has never taken this long to put up, what a disgrace! Remy is going to think she has grinches for parents!
407166931184013300,Sun Dec 01 15:18:55 +0000 2013,Well I was admitted to the hospital last Sunday. To celebrate that it's been a whole week they should probably send me home!
406972179541012500,Sun Dec 01 02:25:03 +0000 2013,@josh_dies plug Remy's ears please.
406971999915749400,Sun Dec 01 02:24:20 +0000 2013,@tumbleweedshc thank you! It's happening at some point, that's all I care about!
406971275303596000,Sun Dec 01 02:21:27 +0000 2013,@tumbleweedshc I am still here! But should be getting out soon
406970186281918460,Sun Dec 01 02:17:08 +0000 2013,@josh_dies oh, that. Forgive us but we are boycotting Christmas starting yet.
406969798447226900,Sun Dec 01 02:15:35 +0000 2013,@josh_dies time for what!?
406969722597433340,Sun Dec 01 02:15:17 +0000 2013,Hmm... Sponge bathe myself with a nurse in the room? I don't think so. I lived in a van with boys for years, I'd rather stink.
406939738860290050,Sun Dec 01 00:16:08 +0000 2013,Every time I open the hospital menu like there's going to be new choices in there. What a fool I am!
406893946959188000,Sat Nov 30 21:14:11 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh! and babies are the snuggliest little nugget when wrapped up, ever. It kills me!
406893779975565300,Sat Nov 30 21:13:31 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh I was terrified she would cry at the quietest part, in front of 800 people, ha. But that wrap is MAGIC.
406884371593830400,Sat Nov 30 20:36:08 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple Remy will sleep in that thing for hours!! Once completely through really loud church, and another time we went on a date!
406882965411487740,Sat Nov 30 20:30:33 +0000 2013,Well one more day of the tube and then maybe I can go home.
406870481631858700,Sat Nov 30 19:40:56 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple have you tried out wearing Imogen in a wrap yet?
406696443441721340,Sat Nov 30 08:09:22 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I'm good and feeling better so I hope that means I'm better &amp; going home soon! It's time to start Christmas,for heavens sake!
406686610877464600,Sat Nov 30 07:30:18 +0000 2013,Trying not to think too much about the fact that there is a tube coming out of me that is touching my lung. That makes me lose my mind!
406686278164312060,Sat Nov 30 07:28:59 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ooh maybe she started cluster feeding! That stuff is no joke!
406573407199703040,Sat Nov 30 00:00:28 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha! And oh yes, do we have quite the sharter on our hands also. It's the funniest!
406539958346715140,Fri Nov 29 21:47:33 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha ha, what's the reason behind this nickname?
406537535863922700,Fri Nov 29 21:37:56 +0000 2013,Best friends getting ready to go shop with dad and uncle @garrett__holmes. This picture is a pretty… http://t.co/0D81pdhOqK
406516444172517400,Fri Nov 29 20:14:07 +0000 2013,@emergingthought it's true. Currently I am watching tv, no bra, and drinking crappy hot chocolate in bed. So it's a pretty good day
406515027420520450,Fri Nov 29 20:08:29 +0000 2013,@emergingthought I haven't worn real clothes all week, sometimes not even pants! But that part is like a dream come true.
406514799283933200,Fri Nov 29 20:07:35 +0000 2013,There is a tube hanging out of my side draining my lung off. Yuck. This MIGHT be what fixes me and sends me home this weekend!!
406460093048168450,Fri Nov 29 16:30:12 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie ha!!
406459122620436500,Fri Nov 29 16:26:21 +0000 2013,I am pretty sure this goes without saying, but I'm no longer participating in Crafty Wonderland this year. But next year, watch out!!
406458474780823550,Fri Nov 29 16:23:46 +0000 2013,@GeraldLGriffin awwww man, I wish! Drink extra hot chocolate for us
406289108927926300,Fri Nov 29 05:10:46 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple that's right!!!! Ahhhhhh, so good!
406275655731384300,Fri Nov 29 04:17:19 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple how big was she at birth? I love her!
406275395227365400,Fri Nov 29 04:16:17 +0000 2013,@LantanaVintage @emergingthought yes!! I wish! And @vanillaandlace is at a third hospital right now!!
406275180961353700,Fri Nov 29 04:15:26 +0000 2013,@motherhoodcult they think I maybe aspirated something during the csection or at some point in the hospital stay, to cause some infection
406271608618090500,Fri Nov 29 04:01:14 +0000 2013,@emergingthought thank you!! I'm just glad I'm not having a major illness, I'm fixable!
406270543050977300,Fri Nov 29 03:57:00 +0000 2013,It's looking like it'll be a couple more days. Tests/procedures keep getting pushed back. But in a week is the best Christmas party ever!!
406190770593345540,Thu Nov 28 22:40:01 +0000 2013,@hello_alix thank you! And me too!
406178737391038460,Thu Nov 28 21:52:12 +0000 2013,Today is not a go home day, it's a drain more fluid off my lung day. That's not nearly as good.
406108346400268300,Thu Nov 28 17:12:29 +0000 2013,Talking to Patrick on the phone as he's about to feed Remy "Oh balls. hold on. Let me call you back." Ha I like watching the single dad show
405903639350231040,Thu Nov 28 03:39:03 +0000 2013,This is how I've been hanging out with my visitors all week. It could be a whole lot worse http://t.co/A6brGTDQPc
405901124994998300,Thu Nov 28 03:29:04 +0000 2013,Crossing my fingers for a turkey day discharge from the hospital. I'd be pretty thankful for that. 🍗🍗🍗
405779416732561400,Wed Nov 27 19:25:26 +0000 2013,Patrick told me he and Remy did laundry this morning, she helped by riding in the basket wrapped in clothes.
405699508333318140,Wed Nov 27 14:07:54 +0000 2013,@darbycisneros hey that means we just need a redo later!!!
405568018232512500,Wed Nov 27 05:25:25 +0000 2013,@mdchughes what a goober. Well I will make him keep you updated tomorrow!
405560804264525800,Wed Nov 27 04:56:45 +0000 2013,@mdchughes Patrick said no way, that guys lame
405560466165882900,Wed Nov 27 04:55:24 +0000 2013,Juuuuust kidding, I'm now going home tomorrow. Thanksgiving dinner will most likely be cereal, ha ha.
405281522367741950,Tue Nov 26 10:26:59 +0000 2013,On a more fun note, we are probably moving into a big apartment soon. Hello baby's room and hello studio! Remy &amp; maddie have to share a room
405269684603203600,Tue Nov 26 09:39:57 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow yeah! Remy is fine and home with dad, luckily the hospital is like 5 minutes from our house!
405233947560263700,Tue Nov 26 07:17:56 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow ha!!!
405233807952842750,Tue Nov 26 07:17:23 +0000 2013,Supposed to be busting out of here tomorrow, let's hope that happens. Don't get fluid in your lungs...twice!
404859693719228400,Mon Nov 25 06:30:47 +0000 2013,@xochiana thanks! I also never replied to your text, but we would love to see you sometime!!
404849725632823300,Mon Nov 25 05:51:10 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I knew they'd drag me back in here somehow!!!
404849609085693950,Mon Nov 25 05:50:43 +0000 2013,I'm at the hospital for some labor issues that popped up again, but they are working on it and I should be just fine and home tomorrow!
404721267137212400,Sun Nov 24 21:20:44 +0000 2013,Well I'm back in the hospital. Happy Thanksgiving week to us!
404062534321184800,Sat Nov 23 01:43:09 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I keep trying to remember that if the worst thing that happens is going all formula, things could be a whole lot worse!
404059892115202050,Sat Nov 23 01:32:40 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple we have been since last week! All of my crazy hospital stuff slowed my milk down. That was hard to swallow for some reason!
404055580580380700,Sat Nov 23 01:15:32 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple also, are you still having to supplement with formula?
404055483289317400,Sat Nov 23 01:15:08 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple yay!!!!!!!!!
404055302749683700,Sat Nov 23 01:14:25 +0000 2013,RT @Taylerannedavis: I met Remy Porter today. I've never heard a baby fart so much. Takes after her parents. http://t.co/Yb8H514lvy
403999473543950340,Fri Nov 22 21:32:35 +0000 2013,All day long maddie is dying to snuggle this girl. When short newborn socks can't be pulled up over… http://t.co/KIlXeWBgCN
403716829694025700,Fri Nov 22 02:49:27 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh I do! We joked that when they said we could go home that there'd be a Remy shaped hole in the wall from her running out
403704818948001800,Fri Nov 22 02:01:43 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh my gosh, it is going to feel SO good to go home!!!
403596066680864800,Thu Nov 21 18:49:35 +0000 2013,@xochiana what about when they say doe instead of though? Or dat?
403247460287406100,Wed Nov 20 19:44:21 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace ha! I was just looking at their menu. I think that's where we'll go finally! And fancy food, bleh
403246581706543100,Wed Nov 20 19:40:51 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace me too!!! And we don't go out very often so I don't want to waste it on a yucky place!
403236830251720700,Wed Nov 20 19:02:06 +0000 2013,@mdchughes that's true, how un-Portland of me!
403235156770570240,Wed Nov 20 18:55:27 +0000 2013,Portland, where should we go out to dinner tonight? It's for our anniversary, but we don't need fancy schmancy
402883864864882700,Tue Nov 19 19:39:33 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple yesssss!!!!!!!! That's the best ever
402878682491916300,Tue Nov 19 19:18:57 +0000 2013,@karahaupt @_sarahnicole sharing is easy!! Under your account settings somewhere there's a place to add up to like 5 other email addresses!
402545180483391500,Mon Nov 18 21:13:44 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace for real! I got that and tdap at once. I'm like a walking pharmacy now, oops.
402544328972570600,Mon Nov 18 21:10:21 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse @vanillaandlace I was told the measles are one the rise in the NW because of people not vaccinating. It's such a tough topic!
402543820245454850,Mon Nov 18 21:08:20 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace . We skipped the hep b one for now, I don't know what to do either!
402543787009781760,Mon Nov 18 21:08:12 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace I've never had a flu shot but I got one after labor. Because i was bored from living in the hospital probably.
402542531512000500,Mon Nov 18 21:03:13 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace oh!Not saying you will die, ha. I just mean sometimes vaccines can be a good &amp; helpful resource to be able to have access to
402542004980035600,Mon Nov 18 21:01:07 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace ...it seems like it won't hurt anything to get it. And there's none of the icky preservatives if you get a single dose vial
402541756303949800,Mon Nov 18 21:00:08 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace all of my midwives recommend that &amp; flu shot. They had patients straight up die a few years ago w/the bird flu thing.
402322603693449200,Mon Nov 18 06:29:18 +0000 2013,I would pay someone a million dollars to take maddie outside right now. Where is my butler?
402319254189379600,Mon Nov 18 06:15:59 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I was told not to try the castor oil thing! Ha ha
402187500737003500,Sun Nov 17 21:32:27 +0000 2013,Happy 6th anniversary/9 years together to me! http://t.co/twDFpQfq4F
401841457109028860,Sat Nov 16 22:37:23 +0000 2013,Also, plus side of living in a studio? You get to sleep by your Christmas tree!!
401840494109413400,Sat Nov 16 22:33:34 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace yeah, I almost burn our building down when timbers games are going on.
401839957959901200,Sat Nov 16 22:31:26 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace and as a possible spoiler, Remy completely looks like her 20 week ultrasound, it's crazy!
401839630275723260,Sat Nov 16 22:30:08 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace it's REAL weird finally knowing who was inside you the entire time. Like maybe the weirdest part of all of this
401839358988132350,Sat Nov 16 22:29:03 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace rude
401839259620884500,Sat Nov 16 22:28:39 +0000 2013,The weekend after next is Christmas tree time!!!! Yikes! That's my favorite day!!!!
401607369789935600,Sat Nov 16 07:07:13 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox yes!!!! Ha ha "smiling pile of poo"
401596715993550850,Sat Nov 16 06:24:53 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie better now! It's confusing but labor (temporarily!) messed up my heart and lungs. So I've had instructions to be extra lazy
401594969393094660,Sat Nov 16 06:17:56 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse oh it's so true!! And it's the perfect weather for just staying cozy inside
401594202007408640,Sat Nov 16 06:14:53 +0000 2013,The plus side of getting pretty darn sick from labor? Getting to snuggle a baby all day and night and do nothing else for weeks!
401579158490185700,Sat Nov 16 05:15:07 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple yessss!!! That's the best!!
401394658887999500,Fri Nov 15 17:01:58 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow people are so weird! People would freak out when Id say I had another month left &amp; say I couldn't get bigger!
401382366234427400,Fri Nov 15 16:13:08 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow love this! People started telling me I was due any day now at 6 months also, ha. And I measures right on track!
400886070746681340,Thu Nov 14 07:21:02 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple she's good! We are having some nursing challenges, but we are powering through!
400872619747975200,Thu Nov 14 06:27:35 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh I loved that!!! We were booty out for months I think. Oh I can't wait for you to meet her already!
400580627805642750,Wed Nov 13 11:07:18 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights or my ring!!
400580563116892160,Wed Nov 13 11:07:03 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights no shoes yet! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
400575040430698500,Wed Nov 13 10:45:06 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple a week and a half!?! Holy cow! Come right now baby! I am so excited for you. I say lounge around, sleep, and eat until then!
400088424712912900,Tue Nov 12 02:31:28 +0000 2013,All of this hospital time and crazy recovery put a damper on my chances of doing crafty wonderland. Plus side? More baby snuggles!
400008216194850800,Mon Nov 11 21:12:45 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I literally wore the same outfit for 2 months. I had a stretchy h&amp;m dress in 2 colors with leggings or tights. For 2 months!!
399973335884656640,Mon Nov 11 18:54:09 +0000 2013,Such a 'tude http://t.co/7g6Rri26tR
399966071308189700,Mon Nov 11 18:25:17 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow was the ultrasound so cool?
399595177670484000,Sun Nov 10 17:51:29 +0000 2013,Do I dare see if shoes fit me yet?! I've worn slippers since July or August. Lets just say my body and pregnancy didn't do so well together.
399593350149324800,Sun Nov 10 17:44:13 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple normal stuff is going to make that feel way better! I'm starting to feel zombie-ish just being home all day!
399593054350213100,Sun Nov 10 17:43:02 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple being tired!! I thought maybe that was being exaggerated, but it wasn't completely! But I also think getting out and doing
399423319306289150,Sun Nov 10 06:28:34 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple we have been spoiled rotten! Friends bring us dinner and fill our fridge with food!
399421737118359550,Sun Nov 10 06:22:17 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I think we are getting the hang of it! But we have entered into the phase of eating literally every single hour
399409180542369800,Sun Nov 10 05:32:23 +0000 2013,I have nursed for over 5 hours total today. Help!!
399352160367820800,Sun Nov 10 01:45:49 +0000 2013,I think I would've gone crazy this week without @friendly_fox to answer my 100 questions a day!
399152774669008900,Sat Nov 09 12:33:32 +0000 2013,Maddie doesn't like walking far from the house anymore &amp; gets antsy and paces around when friends hold Remy. So I think they're friends now
399151066362556400,Sat Nov 09 12:26:44 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple awww she is getting all her naughtiness out before baby, that must be it
399147793408749600,Sat Nov 09 12:13:44 +0000 2013,@megan_nielsen @jenloveskev that is weird and creepy! I thought it was just a cute elf
398906497943339000,Fri Nov 08 20:14:55 +0000 2013,@jenloveskev @megan_nielsen to get them to behave? I thought it was just a fun thing! I don't know anything about this elf thing
398683304318083100,Fri Nov 08 05:28:01 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow you get to see all the blood flow in the spine! It's really so cool and reassuring getting to see everything working
398681725183615000,Fri Nov 08 05:21:45 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow @withlovekacie I wasn't sure! Patrick asked how certain he was about the gender, he said "well those are ovaries right there"
398681145019080700,Fri Nov 08 05:19:26 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple thank you! I'm doing a lot better, had a checkup today and I am on my way to all the way healthy!We are just happy to be home
398667230851768300,Fri Nov 08 04:24:09 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow oh the big fancy ultrasounds are so awesome! You get to see everything, even down to tiny heart valves and stuff
398621986345087000,Fri Nov 08 01:24:22 +0000 2013,@tessfine that's true! and clothes will last a lot longer this way, we won't be onto the next size forever!
398568268257976300,Thu Nov 07 21:50:54 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie ooh that's what I've been using!! I love it!! And teething... Blehh
398567372123951100,Thu Nov 07 21:47:21 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie it's getting better!! At first she wasn't eating enough. I am ready for it not to be so uncomfortable at the start!
398566081360453600,Thu Nov 07 21:42:13 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie it's torture waking myself up at night when everything is quiet and calm!!
398564142266581000,Thu Nov 07 21:34:31 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie I am! I feel a ton better. We also lucked out with a sleepy baby who has to be coaxed into eating, so stress levels are low!
398563194219687940,Thu Nov 07 21:30:45 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie no joke!
398556219289247740,Thu Nov 07 21:03:02 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace she is just so long that it makes her skinny. I just want tights to fit!
398555104384532500,Thu Nov 07 20:58:36 +0000 2013,Wait!!! Halloween happened and I had no candy!!!! This has never even close to happened in my entire life!
398553506128203800,Thu Nov 07 20:52:15 +0000 2013,Someone is too skinny for newborn sizes &amp; we mostly have 0-3m, so we gots no clothes to wear besides pajamas. Trying to fatten this girl up!
398510549832441860,Thu Nov 07 18:01:33 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple we ordered from http://t.co/tt8JlsMz4I and it was so good! I'm never buying stuff like that in the store again
398334252422410240,Thu Nov 07 06:21:01 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights @arrowandapple Acting like all of Christianity doesn't revolve around a pregnant unwed teenager in the first place
398332856511901700,Thu Nov 07 06:15:28 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow praying for you and baby! You will be just fine, go snuggle your hubs and don't think about it!
398181537427910660,Wed Nov 06 20:14:11 +0000 2013,The incessant baby tweets will stop soon, but not yet. I want to take fun pictures today, but we just can't stop napping instead. Oops
397746821109260300,Tue Nov 05 15:26:46 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple yummmmm!! I  take that advice!
397746244698648600,Tue Nov 05 15:24:29 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie I think it's all those! Ha. But the belly band thing sounds amaaaaazing!
397715050456023040,Tue Nov 05 13:20:31 +0000 2013,Csection mamas, how in the world did you sleep afterwards?? I CANNOT get comfortable for the life of me. I need a dang masseuse!
397608699960647700,Tue Nov 05 06:17:55 +0000 2013,@MsEmilyApple thank you!! Also, I coincidentally got your new book the day we had to go into the hospital. We're excited to finally read it!
397593046532911100,Tue Nov 05 05:15:43 +0000 2013,We are HOME!!!!! No more hospitals! ( even though we already have like a billion follow up appointments, ha). Home!!
397525236813295600,Tue Nov 05 00:46:16 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace @arrowandapple I had them for what seemed all day long starting at 20 weeks!!
397515449857896450,Tue Nov 05 00:07:23 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace it's beanstalk! Sweet peas seemed to have no better quality/selection than value village or something
397514719222714400,Tue Nov 05 00:04:29 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace no! It's not sweet peas! That one sucked!!!
397483913678819300,Mon Nov 04 22:02:04 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace it's small but what they do have is super nice! It's going to take awhile for our 0-3m skinny jeans to fit this skinny butt
397478835207168000,Mon Nov 04 21:41:53 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace did you go to sweet peas by fremont whole foods? We are high class because of them with baby gap and stella McCartney, ha
397010378615312400,Sun Nov 03 14:40:25 +0000 2013,@TabathaYoast that is the very first thing I noticed! They are completely curled too, I am jealous!
397010008379912200,Sun Nov 03 14:38:56 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh, it's pretty ridiculous!!! She is so cute I might die!
397009557035024400,Sun Nov 03 14:37:09 +0000 2013,Praise The Lord for apps with white noise/womb sounds!!! We love them over here for chilling. &amp; nurses who snuggle your baby while you sleep
396812393285574660,Sun Nov 03 01:33:41 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple they are longer than mine and perfectly curled!! And it looks like we get to go home maybe tomorrow or for sure by Monday!
396812170240860160,Sun Nov 03 01:32:48 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights oh, they are ridiculous and way longer than mine!!
396805604527714300,Sun Nov 03 01:06:43 +0000 2013,We are surrounded by the best and most supportive people ever, it's awesome. We are so lucky and thankful
396787168305496060,Sat Nov 02 23:53:27 +0000 2013,Eight days down in the hospital, Patrick and the baby were squatters hiding out for awhile because I… http://t.co/P1js2umXeH
396649807059484700,Sat Nov 02 14:47:38 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple so great!!We are all okay and I'm getting moved to stay in the room with Patrick&amp;the baby today (see, it's a REAL long story)
396642824080220160,Sat Nov 02 14:19:53 +0000 2013,Look, it's ol' lemon head. http://t.co/3eGHAP5fuR
396452127800700900,Sat Nov 02 01:42:07 +0000 2013,I may be verging on the award for the worlds weirdest birth story. We want to go home!
396084666232352800,Fri Nov 01 01:21:57 +0000 2013,@mandimakes yes!!!! I couldn't believe my eyes!
396084087804289000,Fri Nov 01 01:19:40 +0000 2013,Baby finally is here!! She decided to show up last night. Pictures in daylight to follow, for we've got some hair and lashes to show off!
395444027601866750,Wed Oct 30 06:56:17 +0000 2013,This video kills me! And to be honest, baby/kid videos are just not my thing normally, so sue me! http://t.co/kDbv9c5i1x
395240665455411200,Tue Oct 29 17:28:12 +0000 2013,Maddie is breaking my heart!!! photo http://t.co/d7yOXREu8s
395234681722896400,Tue Oct 29 17:04:25 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple thank you!!! And ooh! I will tell the baby she can eat donuts for life if she just comes out
395233776843767800,Tue Oct 29 17:00:50 +0000 2013,@motherhoodcult I apparently made the worlds most stubborn baby! But I am pretty stubborn and have somehow powered through insane boredom!
395233599844122600,Tue Oct 29 17:00:07 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple  loads of meds. My blood pressure is still iffy so they still need to get her out of there. I feel good about today!
395233493656936450,Tue Oct 29 16:59:42 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I've been having smaller (but still uncomfortable!) the whole time. They just don't want to do anything super drastic with
395225584508219400,Tue Oct 29 16:28:16 +0000 2013,How about the 29th for a birthday!? Still fun, but not too spooky like actual Halloween.
395052830051954700,Tue Oct 29 05:01:49 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox oh! Our nurse said someone who works in labor&amp;delivery here is the owners mom or mom in law. What a lucky lady!
395051891572224000,Tue Oct 29 04:58:05 +0000 2013,We had chipotle brought to us for dinner...if that won't convince a baby it's better on the outside world then what will!?
394981279118000100,Tue Oct 29 00:17:30 +0000 2013,@tessfine I hoped it wouldn't be too mean of a trick, but I couldn't help it with that cute of a picture!
394902629513314300,Mon Oct 28 19:04:58 +0000 2013,@mdchughes good question! She probably will jump out once she sees how cute maddie is
394901609622151200,Mon Oct 28 19:00:55 +0000 2013,Feast your eyes on the world's cutest girl ever http://t.co/sWPHTUFoR5
394866157670252540,Mon Oct 28 16:40:02 +0000 2013,@Garrett__Holmes and let her run loose in the hallways! Cheering up everyone she runs by
394862823735435260,Mon Oct 28 16:26:48 +0000 2013,And can someone tell this hospital I would like to have maddie as a visitor!
394861668800266240,Mon Oct 28 16:22:12 +0000 2013,Dear baby, I think the 28th sounds like a good birthday. So lets do that!
394673681592369150,Mon Oct 28 03:55:13 +0000 2013,@ideegeniale the midwife route has made me feel way more at ease with the being induced&amp;medications that end up being involved with that.
394529535137284100,Sun Oct 27 18:22:25 +0000 2013,Still just waiting. Talk about a stubborn girl, I wonder where in the world she could've gotten that from...
394292790881812500,Sun Oct 27 02:41:41 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow me too!! I'm glad we're at the hospital though, where we can be watched the whole time!!
394191512205922300,Sat Oct 26 19:59:14 +0000 2013,@transientexp I wish I was in labor! Just waiting for it!
394190785656008700,Sat Oct 26 19:56:21 +0000 2013,Also, my blood pressure had gotten lower each time they've checked it today, so that's a miracle!
394190603761623040,Sat Oct 26 19:55:38 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple it still might be a couple days (yikes!) but they are hoping stuff gets going by tonight!
394188940128682000,Sat Oct 26 19:49:01 +0000 2013,My midwives ended up suspecting preeclampsia, so they decided it'd be best to induce me. It's been 12 hours with not much action so far!

393432285384433660,Thu Oct 24 17:42:21 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple pretty good! Just trying to get things officially ready around here! I finally did baby laundry, so tiny!!
393406414321750000,Thu Oct 24 15:59:32 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple you ARE the best shopper ever! I love it! And shoot yeah, I say it's definitely worth a try,  I know people who love it!
393403615273955300,Thu Oct 24 15:48:25 +0000 2013,@karahaupt hmmm I think me and maddie agree!
393403288613175300,Thu Oct 24 15:47:07 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I was considering it but decided not to! I thought it might be too much to keep up with in our tiny apartment
393110192100892700,Wed Oct 23 20:22:28 +0000 2013,@xochiana well I just appreciate that you know what I'm talking about!
393099091023896600,Wed Oct 23 19:38:21 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow @arrowandapple yessss!!!! But shopping at dream places with only cute things
393098684499378200,Wed Oct 23 19:36:44 +0000 2013,10! (Said exactly how Monica says "seven" the last time)
393098050916212740,Wed Oct 23 19:34:13 +0000 2013,I am "supposed" to have a baby in 10 days...... 10!!!!
392813020063096800,Wed Oct 23 00:41:36 +0000 2013,@emergingthought ha ha!!!!! Seriously
392768488982327300,Tue Oct 22 21:44:39 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I swear the tiredness increases every single day! And I think this girl isn't going anywhere anytime soon
392768081509879800,Tue Oct 22 21:43:02 +0000 2013,Maddie hates green apples, but insists on barking and grumbling at me for not sharing the whole time I'm eating one anyway.
392733466275487740,Tue Oct 22 19:25:29 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple you can get fabric paint at craft stores! Or there is this mixing medium that turns paint into fabric paint
392698651245412350,Tue Oct 22 17:07:09 +0000 2013,We are excited to add this to baby's library! A task we take seriously   “@MsEmilyApple: Happy Publication Day http://t.co/BJ1yQhaLWx”
392697582612267000,Tue Oct 22 17:02:54 +0000 2013,@MsEmilyApple oh my gosh, what an exciting day!!! Congratulations!!
392696582669213700,Tue Oct 22 16:58:55 +0000 2013,@DelightTacky oh the non twitter things I could tell you!!
392696255324770300,Tue Oct 22 16:57:37 +0000 2013,@lindsijensen ha!! Yeah, you just can't win with your children!
392524184154152960,Tue Oct 22 05:33:52 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace I just have like a wide belt instead! I'll eat ice cream off of myself even if it means slouching until I fall off the couch
392517565601165300,Tue Oct 22 05:07:34 +0000 2013,@powersurf ooh yeah, have her make up for it later in life.
392517130446336000,Tue Oct 22 05:05:51 +0000 2013,I am due in less than two weeks &amp; I have yet to really be able to use my belly as a shelf. What a rip off. It only works if I slouch a LOT
392511479720575000,Tue Oct 22 04:43:23 +0000 2013,@powersurf oooh she hates the clippers with a passion
392463432781275140,Tue Oct 22 01:32:28 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha! I know I am just a walking pile of dog hair when I'm not wearing white, it's bad!
392457902834737150,Tue Oct 22 01:10:30 +0000 2013,Being a parent is rough. We had to pass on the black moby wrap, that just won't work with miss-sheds-a-lot-maddie. The sacrifices we make!!
392153556087623700,Mon Oct 21 05:01:08 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse oh I am ready to shamelessly eat, I've been excited for that for awhile!
392150854314102800,Mon Oct 21 04:50:24 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse yesss! Thank you!!
392149256795996160,Mon Oct 21 04:44:03 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse awww yay! We've loved everyone we've met from there so far, I feel really good about choosing there!
392148924384833540,Mon Oct 21 04:42:44 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse yep, at Emmanuel!
392147134008393700,Mon Oct 21 04:35:37 +0000 2013,Hospital bag necessities? And also what is totally useless! Sorry if I'm making all you plan-aheaders die a little inside
392142194481451000,Mon Oct 21 04:15:59 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple you are!!!! So weird, huh??
391712285388845060,Sat Oct 19 23:47:41 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple well duh. This kid is either going to come out as a yellow noodle or a foil wrapped burrito based on my food choices
391710508551634940,Sat Oct 19 23:40:37 +0000 2013,@tumbleweedshc oh I know how to have a good time now
391709940932292600,Sat Oct 19 23:38:22 +0000 2013,I think I just simultaneously assaulted all my of my child's senses. Drank soda &amp; ate the hippie version of Cheetos, while jamming Rancid.
391652861412507650,Sat Oct 19 19:51:33 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse ha! Well the typo fit so well it just felt natural
391628574899204100,Sat Oct 19 18:15:03 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse I feel great!This guy has a history of patients having 2 hour labors! I think Id feel comfortable bringing in a baby, I think!
391625649657348100,Sat Oct 19 18:03:25 +0000 2013,Saw a chiropractor yesterday to get everything in line for a human to emerge from me. I will not pop even finger joints, so that was weird
391371342802472960,Sat Oct 19 01:12:54 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse ah! She is my at the number one spot on my dream tattooer list!
391231507961901060,Fri Oct 18 15:57:14 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole I know a certain boy with a tattoo of a Godzilla Elvis with a donut for a halo. So that position is hard to come by in my book
391088446397091840,Fri Oct 18 06:28:46 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I dream of doing that!!!! Ha ha. And sleeping on my stomach. I haven't worn real shoes in over 2 months either...
391087910591541250,Fri Oct 18 06:26:38 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh I literally go sometimes as much as every hour at night! When the baby comes Ill sleep more I'm convinced!
391086625238704100,Fri Oct 18 06:21:32 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple and things get lower, which I didn't think was possible!
391086026002673660,Fri Oct 18 06:19:09 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I am just hoping for not late! I can barely walk or do anything as it is now, I couldn't imagine like 4 weeks from now
391085633491333100,Fri Oct 18 06:17:35 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh shoot! Well maybe that will be it then! I'm ready to get this show on the road, I think!
391085124751589400,Fri Oct 18 06:15:34 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple darn it! I don't feel anything!!!
391084780520874000,Fri Oct 18 06:14:12 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I've heard it's not completely a myth!!
390985993274544100,Thu Oct 17 23:41:39 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow that is the stroller we are going to get!!
390956212994314240,Thu Oct 17 21:43:19 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple sleep and a frozen cloth on my face helped a lot! And then I had Patrick buy me Tylenol, ha. After that I was really good!
390923568046825500,Thu Oct 17 19:33:36 +0000 2013,Dreaming about roasted Brussels sprouts... I've never been more excited to go to the store. It's the little things you know.
390704908137029600,Thu Oct 17 05:04:43 +0000 2013,@Laurachavous it seems like it'd be easier before they can move around!
390620444824330240,Wed Oct 16 23:29:06 +0000 2013,@tessfine or can't that guy called Dad hold the baby while we brush??
390573979968475140,Wed Oct 16 20:24:27 +0000 2013,Telling someone to get ready to never shower or brush your teeth or sleep again is not the nicest thing to say to almost parents!
390531963440087040,Wed Oct 16 17:37:30 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace oh, and crying gets you a lot of maddie hugs!
390530827689263100,Wed Oct 16 17:32:59 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace I don't know, 12 hours of crying on the couch is another good and mature solution also...
390508669718110200,Wed Oct 16 16:04:56 +0000 2013,@SidewalkEsther yes!! I am extremely lucky and just last night had my first one, but it's still here! These babies better love us!
390504031367344100,Wed Oct 16 15:46:30 +0000 2013,Migraines while pregnant and unable to take medicine... Wowie zowie that's a new experience
390236011390717950,Tue Oct 15 22:01:30 +0000 2013,@skunkboy @RachelDenbow yessss!! You look so amazing! And that's the best costume ever, you should win an award, like 'Miss Halloween'
390235366600364000,Tue Oct 15 21:58:56 +0000 2013,Had a giant, giant sandwich for lunch. And I would really like another one right about now, thank you. Giant!
390201636351528960,Tue Oct 15 19:44:54 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I say you're allowed to be suckers a little bit when you're new parents!!
389891290868895740,Mon Oct 14 23:11:42 +0000 2013,Anyone know of any good crochet (or beginner knitting) patterns for good winter baby hats? There are some ugly patterns out there!
389841491822411800,Mon Oct 14 19:53:49 +0000 2013,@tessfine it's nuts!! I'm so excited for you!
389841303309398000,Mon Oct 14 19:53:04 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple pasta... Yummmmmmmm. Hey when the baby gets lower you get more room for a stomach! So I am HUNGRY all the time. Hungry!
389840907534893060,Mon Oct 14 19:51:29 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha!!! Oh I like to think of it that way. If she's like her dad we are in big day trouble, he could wait/be patient forEVER
389840706225078300,Mon Oct 14 19:50:41 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace another reason to get a Costco card!! That and the samples, obviously.
389817072559333400,Mon Oct 14 18:16:47 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse I keep thinking if we use hippie detergent already, how different could the baby kind be!
389816403450400800,Mon Oct 14 18:14:07 +0000 2013,What type of detergent do you guys use for baby laundry? I am wondering if just all natural detergent would do the same job
389816025996611600,Mon Oct 14 18:12:37 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh yeah! I forgot, I never decided on a kind. Or I'm curious if just any all natural detergent works!
389815199592890400,Mon Oct 14 18:09:20 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse @arrowandapple oh, it's so weird! Or it could still be weeks, and I am not a patient person when it comes to surprises!!
389814673362939900,Mon Oct 14 18:07:15 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I feel not ready in the practical sense at all!!!! Maybe today I will start packing a bag and do baby laundry, yikes!!!!
389812897754664960,Mon Oct 14 18:00:11 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple it's kind of crazy to think she could literally come at any second! Which thinking about makes me sleep even less now, ha ha
389810168760123400,Mon Oct 14 17:49:21 +0000 2013,Everyone, I have officially been full term for almost 3 days! With a possible 6 lb baby, so my worry of a giant baby is possibly over.
389603078594232300,Mon Oct 14 04:06:27 +0000 2013,p.s. I will now sleep for a week after running for 15 seconds.
389602268363763700,Mon Oct 14 04:03:13 +0000 2013,Got out of my car &amp;some weird guy was standing too close/possibly following me. So I ran to our building. That was probably a sight to see!
389263770809163800,Sun Oct 13 05:38:09 +0000 2013,@xochiana you're not feeling well, you need comfort food! And that cake is darn delicious
389202275710681100,Sun Oct 13 01:33:48 +0000 2013,Went to two back to back baby showers today... Lets just say maybe I ate for 6 hours straight. Anything to get through the day,am I right?
388866324954239000,Sat Oct 12 03:18:51 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple that's a requirement! But the people who see me walk the dog in the morning may have a different opinion
388861184054542340,Sat Oct 12 02:58:25 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha ha! I have completely entered that phase, I just don't care what I eat and wear slippers all day. Hey I still wear makeup!
388688141889982460,Fri Oct 11 15:30:49 +0000 2013,@Laurachavous ha! It is a big craft fair that happens in Portland every year.
388403336577175550,Thu Oct 10 20:39:06 +0000 2013,@clarelanusse if she comes on her due date, she'd be 1 1/2 months!
388385478052835300,Thu Oct 10 19:28:08 +0000 2013,@jmojicaphoto I'll keep that in mind! And no signs yet!!
388383667896070140,Thu Oct 10 19:20:56 +0000 2013,Got accepted into crafty wonderland... Now am I completely nuts for doing that with a newborn? Ahhh! Decisions!!!
388001664646795260,Wed Oct 09 18:03:00 +0000 2013,Maddie is graduated from level 2 dog school! She will be homeschooled for high school. But all that and she can't even paint my toenails
387666862948880400,Tue Oct 08 19:52:37 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow I think mine are here... They just aren't stronger than tiredness!!
387664907367223300,Tue Oct 08 19:44:51 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow ooh enjoy! My nesting hormones are still nowhere to be found.... yikes
387460263965757440,Tue Oct 08 06:11:40 +0000 2013,@EmilyTheOtt you need this! http://t.co/hUYm8MbVKl
387460263965757440,Tue Oct 08 06:11:40 +0000 2013,@EmilyTheOtt you need this! http://t.co/hUYm8MbVKl
387450498392944640,Tue Oct 08 05:32:51 +0000 2013,@icantsavemyself I know!! Who am I anymore... I've lost myself already!
387364151820955650,Mon Oct 07 23:49:45 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha ha!! The cartoony stuff gets appealing! Maybe a dog with goggles is best left at the store then
387363980781420540,Mon Oct 07 23:49:04 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple it's funny because something as silly and fun as what patterns to get feels like the most important choice ever.
387362503195246600,Mon Oct 07 23:43:12 +0000 2013,Life is hard! I picked out blankets today with hot air balloons &amp; owls on them, but passed up a flying goggle wearing dog print.. Who am I?
387309052423700500,Mon Oct 07 20:10:48 +0000 2013,Sheesh, I am already slightly feeling "mom guilt" because I haven't made anything for the baby. Then I remember she just knows food &amp; poop!
386715152571056100,Sun Oct 06 04:50:51 +0000 2013,@urbangoatspdx I am in desperate need of baby goat hugs!
386713530604335100,Sun Oct 06 04:44:25 +0000 2013,@MsEmilyApple ooh I want to earn that badge if it means I get to do that!
386713321748983800,Sun Oct 06 04:43:35 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I might have been the most unkinfolk choice possible. I was sweaty and probably told bad jokes the whole time
386665340685385700,Sun Oct 06 01:32:55 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha ha! Well as a former cover girl I am beyond offended. So now you better get some donuts to me somehow.
386664691914657800,Sun Oct 06 01:30:21 +0000 2013,Does anyone know if there are still baby goats in the goat field? If so I am going to visit them this week or I'll die. (Ahem @xochiana?)
386603577461858300,Sat Oct 05 21:27:30 +0000 2013,@xochiana you may get those to me promptly, thank you. @friendly_fox forget you!
385888243096383500,Thu Oct 03 22:05:01 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie I had a mini crisis of identify for a minute, I thought maybe I was tan and had no idea who I was anymore!!
385884007289733100,Thu Oct 03 21:48:11 +0000 2013,@withlovekacie it was weird! She was like "hmm I don't think you're as pale as you think" as she grabbed foundation like 4 shades too dark
385858470127218700,Thu Oct 03 20:06:42 +0000 2013,The girl at sephora put really dark concealer on me and bronzer on my neck. Apparently I am,for the first time ever,tan and have no jawline.
385856718636597250,Thu Oct 03 19:59:45 +0000 2013,Praise the Lord for at home espresso machines and americanos. Yum. http://t.co/wWMDBGw6ZB
385452907018989600,Wed Oct 02 17:15:09 +0000 2013,@ohsolovelies ha! Good grief. Also... Don't like, a million girls have bangs?
384900981273534460,Tue Oct 01 04:41:59 +0000 2013,I am SO excited to try out my new giant @BumpNest pillow tonight. I might sleep in a ridiculous amount tomorrow!
384784874210488300,Mon Sep 30 21:00:37 +0000 2013,How common is it for hospitals to have a nursery nowadays? I don't know if any of the hospitals here have them
384440898542506000,Sun Sep 29 22:13:47 +0000 2013,@powersurf ooh she would love to be doing just that!!
384167339085676540,Sun Sep 29 04:06:45 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox the polar bears are how I picture womb maddie!
384130405026529300,Sun Sep 29 01:40:00 +0000 2013,Arranged friendships are cool, right? (Stolen from @friendly_fox) http://t.co/uMeSAVI97w
383847723360731140,Sat Sep 28 06:56:43 +0000 2013,@LaurensLoDown i didn't think about the baby coming in time for looking cute for the holidays. For both of us! Ahhhh shoes&amp; stomach sleeping
383837086031179800,Sat Sep 28 06:14:27 +0000 2013,@LaurensLoDown yes! And cute dresses feel pointless when you just have the same darn slippers on
383836382159843300,Sat Sep 28 06:11:39 +0000 2013,@LaurensLoDown 35 weeks! And I am feeling frumpy. Ha maybe it's because I can only fit my fit into moccasin slippers now, I need real shoes!
383725902489604100,Fri Sep 27 22:52:39 +0000 2013,@LaurensLoDown I did!! She is amazing!! I was feeling too pregnant looking yesterday to capture it, ha ha
383725347344089100,Fri Sep 27 22:50:26 +0000 2013,Since you're all dying to know, I got the best haircut ever yesterday. So thanks to @LaurensLoDown for the recommendation, my hair owes you!
383669186125262850,Fri Sep 27 19:07:16 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I looked up what fall donuts Krispy Kreme has and now we have to go hunt one down, yummm
383660433950777340,Fri Sep 27 18:32:30 +0000 2013,I'm officially not sick anymore I think, so I guess that means I have to get back to work and stuff. Bring coffee!
383659975718875140,Fri Sep 27 18:30:40 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple and also now I want a donut so badly. We should've gotten those when you came through town! Donut lovers stick together
383659689562501100,Fri Sep 27 18:29:32 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple would've contacted me right away if I didn't! So maybe yours is the same??
383659659996823550,Fri Sep 27 18:29:25 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I never heard back about mine and was so nervous, but when I finally asked my midwife said I passed and they
383614776636481540,Fri Sep 27 15:31:04 +0000 2013,@MsEmilyApple I want that dress to be real! I also need to decide which prints of yours the baby needs,start this girl off on the right foot
383613850651598850,Fri Sep 27 15:27:23 +0000 2013,@GeraldLGriffin I will write that down on my list of parenting advice to remember.
383296820274671600,Thu Sep 26 18:27:37 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow we are still deciding if that makes you feel any better! I have not had even ONE idea for a middle name though.
383295955006537700,Thu Sep 26 18:24:11 +0000 2013,What a busy day! Maddie is getting a shot and I'm getting a haircut. I'd say I lucked out on this arrangement.
382952289490595840,Wed Sep 25 19:38:35 +0000 2013,@DelightTacky ha ha!! I just talk in a gross high voice when it's just me walking maddie. We live in a REALLY busy neighborhood too.. Ha
382908686626074600,Wed Sep 25 16:45:19 +0000 2013,@BumpNest my under eye circles would greatly appreciate this  chatting!
382903172492054500,Wed Sep 25 16:23:24 +0000 2013,@DelightTacky I think that's possible! At least mental health, ha ha.
382752566657822700,Wed Sep 25 06:24:57 +0000 2013,@tessfine I lucked out with Portland having some really good consignment shops,with clothes you actually want. But new stuff is tricky!
382749990533099500,Wed Sep 25 06:14:43 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow @BumpNest dang! This might be the solution to my troubles! Ha ha I just gave up on sleeping awhile ago
382275848046276600,Mon Sep 23 22:50:39 +0000 2013,@tessfine if you find out, let me know!
382275742504976400,Mon Sep 23 22:50:14 +0000 2013,@malwarning YES!!!! How is it so good? Tumm
382252067747659800,Mon Sep 23 21:16:09 +0000 2013,@clawandstitch the first sip is spinach and then after that it's just delicious! Especially with the cider from trader joes, yum
382249058728816640,Mon Sep 23 21:04:12 +0000 2013,Spinach blended with spiced cider and a little bit of honey is delicious. Fall in a glass!!
382225207907213300,Mon Sep 23 19:29:25 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @ourcitylights you keep eating that yummy food and he will be here before you know it!!
382224374566109200,Mon Sep 23 19:26:06 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple well it's mostly just fun stuff I guess! We've got the basic important stuff, but not the fun nesting things! Whoops!
382223997649178600,Mon Sep 23 19:24:37 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights woah!!! That's crazy!!!
382221743726678000,Mon Sep 23 19:15:39 +0000 2013,Everyone, in less than 3 weeks this baby will be considered "full" term and could safely come!! Ummm..... WHAT!?
382220870371901440,Mon Sep 23 19:12:11 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @vanillaandlace yeah well your babies can't safely come in 3 weeks!!! I really better start getting stuff done
382195140120416260,Mon Sep 23 17:29:56 +0000 2013,Having a cold on a rainy and cool day means you get to stay in bed as long as you want I've decided! Now if only a chef lived in my kitchen!
382152333657788400,Mon Sep 23 14:39:51 +0000 2013,@tessfine hooray!!!!! That is so exciting!!
381929429003300860,Sun Sep 22 23:54:06 +0000 2013,I think the start of fall may have brought me the gift of a little cold. That's a fair trade off though! Been drinking spinach all day now
381891470426255360,Sun Sep 22 21:23:16 +0000 2013,@tessfine well that's good!! It's just a territory you want to avoid at all costs!!!
381817600163844100,Sun Sep 22 16:29:44 +0000 2013,@SaraBeehive one more question! Favorite brushes for liquid foundation?
381631593598554100,Sun Sep 22 04:10:36 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow I am still laughing about this idea!!! Ha ha
381583158262517760,Sun Sep 22 00:58:09 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow @arrowandapple ha ha!!!! Yes! Pretend labor starting would've been the best reaction ever!!
381563860135583740,Sat Sep 21 23:41:28 +0000 2013,Sephora in Portland, you are not very helpful! Sheesh.
381502411845562400,Sat Sep 21 19:37:17 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox I vow to never wear yoga pants in public once I am a mom also. I'm already pretty lazy as it is, I need all the help I can get
381497585426378750,Sat Sep 21 19:18:06 +0000 2013,@malwarning yes! We've listened to 3 breakups the past few weekends, it's entertaining. But sometimes depressing, ha.
381490981075312640,Sat Sep 21 18:51:52 +0000 2013,I've been waiting all week to go to sephora today, hooray! Old makeup has been sending me too close to frumpy mom zone, &amp; we can't have that
380523094340689900,Thu Sep 19 02:45:50 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow or maybe all 3!!
380477207954485250,Wed Sep 18 23:43:29 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights @RachelDenbow oh in the start I had big vitamix smoothie plans, but couldn't stand it. Luckily now that stuff tastes good!
380476728239329300,Wed Sep 18 23:41:35 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights @RachelDenbow yes, I think they are just delicious! But probably need to shove veggies in my mouth to get to the good stuff!
380474687404273660,Wed Sep 18 23:33:29 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow no joke! It's been like that this entire time. Don't even get me started on macaroni&amp;cheese!!
380466840608067600,Wed Sep 18 23:02:18 +0000 2013,Pregnancy "cravings" have not been so healthy for me. I may have come home from trader joes with pumpkin poptarts. Pumpkin things are back!
380434586863288300,Wed Sep 18 20:54:08 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox I almost meal planned last week.... I think it worked for 2 dinners
380397847754993660,Wed Sep 18 18:28:09 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @SaraBeehive yeah! Tell me how to look good!
380393626930384900,Wed Sep 18 18:11:22 +0000 2013,I ask this all the time, ha, but favorite foundations or concealers?
380172461267886100,Wed Sep 18 03:32:32 +0000 2013,@DelightTacky darn baby! I want to only consume fall related things from here on out, forever!
380163357401026560,Wed Sep 18 02:56:22 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights I have a pregnancy tea with raspberry leaf in it, but I was considering just getting plain old raspberry leaf
380156991974301700,Wed Sep 18 02:31:04 +0000 2013,@xochiana ooh I forgot about that!
380156780858200060,Wed Sep 18 02:30:14 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights are you drinking just raspberry leaf or is it a blend?
380153424966197250,Wed Sep 18 02:16:54 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights I have some but I never remember it! I will make some right now that I'm thinking about it!!
380131876993630200,Wed Sep 18 00:51:16 +0000 2013,P.s. it is like sweet gingery apple cider in tea form somehow! Yummmmmm
380131640384577540,Wed Sep 18 00:50:20 +0000 2013,I want to keep this secret all to myself, but you must run to trader joes and get their harvest blend tea. But wait until I stock up first!
380031164620107800,Tue Sep 17 18:11:04 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple awww! Your ribs hurting were no joke!!! Well I am praying for you. That's no fun and scary!
379852019273441300,Tue Sep 17 06:19:13 +0000 2013,@chelseabird any favorite new (or not new!) makeup things? I have decided to spend birthday $$ on a makeup shopping trip!
379346018925416450,Sun Sep 15 20:48:33 +0000 2013,What should I do with a big and delicious leftover loaf of ciabatta? I am thinking getting healthy and going the bread pudding route
379345690104573950,Sun Sep 15 20:47:15 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple and then we will be tweeting about baby snuggling!
379330635216601100,Sun Sep 15 19:47:25 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple tired x 10!!!!! How are you?
379317262617833500,Sun Sep 15 18:54:17 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple tell me about it! Whoops...
378978366482690050,Sat Sep 14 20:27:38 +0000 2013,About to make brown butter cinnamon&amp;sugar donuts. If Patrick doesn't get home soon after they're done, he just might be really sad.
378977985157533700,Sat Sep 14 20:26:07 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole that is possibly 375 mg of caffeine! Shoot, that is a man.
378922077400477700,Sat Sep 14 16:43:57 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple not yet! We can't pick between our two choices, so we might be waiting until we meet the baby to decide!
378921425312022500,Sat Sep 14 16:41:22 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple well the trade off is that she is down LOW, like super low. Ha ha
378920988609486850,Sat Sep 14 16:39:38 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I haven't! I think the baby is too crowded to get anything up there, like she's permanently curled into a ball!
378771685257650200,Sat Sep 14 06:46:21 +0000 2013,@josh_dies hey that's the season we just started! And it's true
378667749892816900,Fri Sep 13 23:53:21 +0000 2013,When @Garrett__Holmes visits, he brings treats! And always good ones.
378436480420421600,Fri Sep 13 08:34:22 +0000 2013,@xochiana dang, that's a tough choice!!
378303162894925800,Thu Sep 12 23:44:37 +0000 2013,@darbycisneros hooray! I also bought a pumpkin spice soda there that I have yet to try. In my head it's going to be the best thing ever
378302588711473150,Thu Sep 12 23:42:20 +0000 2013,@karahaupt I am waiting for that constant fabulousness thing too! Two more years apparently
378301209137786900,Thu Sep 12 23:36:51 +0000 2013,Kindest words ever!!! “@ohellosara: Check out my new blog post on my favorite handmade dresses from @velvetbird.  http://t.co/SWSOlF3mMp”
378293122616148000,Thu Sep 12 23:04:43 +0000 2013,@ohellosara Well you made my day,my week! You're so kind,it makes me so happy to read this! &amp;that darn wrinkly fabric is too soft to pass up
378292438768443400,Thu Sep 12 23:02:00 +0000 2013,@darbycisneros world market has tons of cool Halloween stuff, it made me think of you. And these cute drinking glasses with sugar skulls
378283650699124740,Thu Sep 12 22:27:05 +0000 2013,@ohellosara I can't see it for some reason! I am super excited about this though!
378258479045017600,Thu Sep 12 20:47:03 +0000 2013,@Laurachavous that is so weird! It's entertaining because its just when I sleep, so I wake up with floppy fingers. Ha ha
378254849604726800,Thu Sep 12 20:32:38 +0000 2013,Who will bring me lunch? Maddie can sit,stay,wait at the door until you tell her to go through it, but can't even cook for me. What the heck
378254087784919040,Thu Sep 12 20:29:36 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole I would like to eat all of that.
378215181475536900,Thu Sep 12 17:55:00 +0000 2013,When I'm sleeping half of my fingers kind of slip in and out of place, like the joints or ligaments are too loose. Am I an alien?
377850978000965600,Wed Sep 11 17:47:47 +0000 2013,@powersurf like, the mermaid?
377850896459517950,Wed Sep 11 17:47:28 +0000 2013,@darbycisneros more like hell!
377624859724881900,Wed Sep 11 02:49:17 +0000 2013,@mdchughes I like that idea! And a shot of espresso on top for good measure
377569662948880400,Tue Sep 10 23:09:57 +0000 2013,Also, they use a chemex a lot on earlier seasons of Friends. So that is really swaying my decision I think
377569013372846100,Tue Sep 10 23:07:22 +0000 2013,If you had to pick, would you choose an aeropress or a chemex/pour over? Tough life choices, I know.
377434625733181440,Tue Sep 10 14:13:21 +0000 2013,@tessfine we do! A girl, and I have yet to make any dresses somehow! Do you know yet? I'm excited for you to find out!
377432640212570100,Tue Sep 10 14:05:28 +0000 2013,@tessfine yes!!! It's so weird/cool! I couldn't until sort of recently. It's like a funny little rhythmic flutter/little kick feeling
377431645043056640,Tue Sep 10 14:01:31 +0000 2013,Oh the joys of parenthood! A certain little furry girl had an accident in her sleep (weird) and now I'm starving and the baby has hiccups.
377315000445968400,Tue Sep 10 06:18:00 +0000 2013,@xochiana ooh!!! That sounds like fun! And my kind of party!
377247668679876600,Tue Sep 10 01:50:27 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow tell it to come here!!! Last week was fall, this week mid 90's are coming!!
377247417738879000,Tue Sep 10 01:49:27 +0000 2013,Don't invite me along when bringing food is involved. It will almost always be some sort of popcorn.  Hey I get fancy with the flavors!
377167213771255800,Mon Sep 09 20:30:45 +0000 2013,@malwarning yessssss!!!!!!
377105085731319800,Mon Sep 09 16:23:53 +0000 2013,My feet&amp;this heat! I thought I was going to have to cut my pants off last night! I didn't feel so bad when I remembered Im 8 months pregnant
377097200230076400,Mon Sep 09 15:52:33 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple good! I drank some lemon lime goo and partially got over my irrational fear of blood drawing! And then passed the test!
377096551669059600,Mon Sep 09 15:49:58 +0000 2013,@mdchughes the burbs.... yuck.
377096370441564160,Mon Sep 09 15:49:15 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple shoot you got this girl! From one donut eater to another
376940888628273150,Mon Sep 09 05:31:25 +0000 2013,@tylerhanns but pickles are delicious!
376938482171527200,Mon Sep 09 05:21:51 +0000 2013,Where does one buy fresh dill? I want to make pickles!! And any favorite recipes?
376851859182325760,Sun Sep 08 23:37:39 +0000 2013,@thepapermama I am in the market for a doula
376849150265925600,Sun Sep 08 23:26:53 +0000 2013,@thepapermama I'm with her on this one
376828938950942700,Sun Sep 08 22:06:34 +0000 2013,If you were putting together a small 1st trimester care package, what would you put in it? (Told you I know one million pregnant people)
376828571001446400,Sun Sep 08 22:05:07 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow oh man, toast is practically a pregnancy necessity!!
376598465234493440,Sun Sep 08 06:50:45 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow shoot but in Portland even regular doctors probably lean toward the hippie side! My midwives are awesome &amp;part of the hospital
376597993723404300,Sun Sep 08 06:48:53 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow I have the updated edition! It's just subtly negative about hospital births. Like it will be sterile with blinding lights
376552159308820500,Sun Sep 08 03:46:45 +0000 2013,I'm enjoying the guide to childbirth, but they are a little too down on anything involving hospital births, good midwives work there too.
376469127386247200,Sat Sep 07 22:16:49 +0000 2013,@malwarning hmm no, she is in charge of that. Sheesh, that's insane
376418564715991040,Sat Sep 07 18:55:54 +0000 2013,@benkrogh yes! I am really behind the times and just recently heard that. How exciting!!!
376416350408687600,Sat Sep 07 18:47:06 +0000 2013,@tessfine yes! Exactly!!!
376416251590873100,Sat Sep 07 18:46:42 +0000 2013,@Laurachavous that DEFINITELY counts!!! That is SO exciting and what we want to do next. Congratulations!
376383123048501250,Sat Sep 07 16:35:04 +0000 2013,Okay so who else out there is pregnant?! I hear that announcement almost once a week in person and then also from someone online.
376184913868771300,Sat Sep 07 03:27:27 +0000 2013,@chelseabird @teekuh @NyxCosmetics I am a lipstick fiend and will have to try this out now!
375844447289749500,Fri Sep 06 04:54:33 +0000 2013,@malwarning shoot we can have a legging making party!
375752636776980500,Thu Sep 05 22:49:44 +0000 2013,@malwarning ha ha, not this week. I was just dreaming about burritos ha ha
375752468283400200,Thu Sep 05 22:49:04 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow @ShopGingiber I will report any magical things I start feeling!
375739449763569660,Thu Sep 05 21:57:20 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow started taking those vitamins! They smell weird so that means they will probably do the trick.
375736932539445250,Thu Sep 05 21:47:20 +0000 2013,Dear @ChipotleTweets do you sponsor pregnancies? Because with how many burritos I've eaten this baby might come out wrapped in foil.
375736301388963840,Thu Sep 05 21:44:49 +0000 2013,@AshFirecracker it's supposed to be almost 90 next week if that makes you feel better, ha ha
375675130845724700,Thu Sep 05 17:41:45 +0000 2013,@malwarning and thanks to the cold, I woke up with almost normal sized feet!!!
375663543678279700,Thu Sep 05 16:55:42 +0000 2013,A high of 66 and rain for the next two days? It's a first week of September miracle! Don't mind me, I'll just be wearing sweaters and crying
375332054738554900,Wed Sep 04 18:58:29 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple ha ha! Yes!! Maybe a certain husband of mine knows all of the rap songs also
375330258888568800,Wed Sep 04 18:51:21 +0000 2013,I've got money burning a hole in my pocket so I am considering buying after baby clothes... now where to go is the question!!
375329076543623200,Wed Sep 04 18:46:39 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple all ugly pajamas need to be taken from me! Ha ha. But Patrick has this 20 year old dc talk shirt that I can't stop wearing!

374751641049645060,Tue Sep 03 04:32:08 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow not eating meat probably means extra iron and b12 can't hurt! And it's so cheap on amazon!
374750027454742500,Tue Sep 03 04:25:43 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow do you take them in addition to or in lieu of prenatals? I want to feel like a new woman!

372889673129295900,Thu Aug 29 01:13:20 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple the women's were too small for my feet! Things just bulged over the straps!
372884661602488300,Thu Aug 29 00:53:25 +0000 2013,Well I've hit a new low today. I bought MEN'S flip flops for my (normally) very narrow sometimes size 6 feet. I am not a flip flop person.
372781499957149700,Wed Aug 28 18:03:30 +0000 2013,I skipped out on a pie eating date to work... that's serious business!!! My heart is a little sad @malwarning @zephyrsarah @friendly_fox

371770791521574900,Sun Aug 25 23:07:18 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow I am obsessed with tiny clothes! And we haven't even entered into dress territory yet! I am in trouble
371766498886713340,Sun Aug 25 22:50:15 +0000 2013,Well, this kid is already way better dressed than me. http://t.co/XyJY9Bxx40

371759909550845950,Sun Aug 25 22:24:04 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox I don't know what hiccups feel like! Also, this baby has stopped kicking &amp; started rolling around like a huge log or something

371466772936810500,Sun Aug 25 02:59:14 +0000 2013,@lindsijensen ha I guess it's more the start of an idea; a blanket that belongs in a Wes Anderson film. However peoplewebs interprets that!
371464935701639200,Sun Aug 25 02:51:56 +0000 2013,@lindsijensen if you still are interested in being a baby blanket maker, I think I have an idea! Well, the start of an idea

371464451284672500,Sun Aug 25 02:50:01 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox thank you for letting me read this
371464254714429440,Sun Aug 25 02:49:14 +0000 2013,RT @johnmarkcomer: Nothing sucks the joy out of life like thinking you're owed better.
371464079950352400,Sun Aug 25 02:48:32 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow well all of my local mountains ARE volcanoes! On a clear day you can see 3, ha ha. We're all doomed!
371463664542298100,Sun Aug 25 02:46:53 +0000 2013,I ate too much ice cream tonight. Whoops. But have you ever had the chocolate therapy at ben&amp;jerrys? It tastes like chocolate pudding.
371066494144090100,Sat Aug 24 00:28:40 +0000 2013,This looks like the perfect pregnant lady dress! Well and just perfect dress in general! http://t.co/FtTxzUa2OE @lindsijensen

370674086885597200,Thu Aug 22 22:29:23 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @ourcitylights ha! I looked at the website for it, that wasnt scary! I don't know about an image search though, ha ha
370669394503802900,Thu Aug 22 22:10:45 +0000 2013,@ourcitylights @arrowandapple ooh yeah, what is this you're talking about? Episiotomies sound like a good thing to avoid...
370669158263824400,Thu Aug 22 22:09:48 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple  isn't that what got you in this "condition" in the first place...
370612328636502000,Thu Aug 22 18:23:59 +0000 2013,But maybe she will skip the whole tattoo on her butt part like Patrick... Not that there's anything wrong with that!
370612078622421000,Thu Aug 22 18:22:59 +0000 2013,Last night I felt a baby booty sticking out of my stomach for all the world to see. Trying to moon people to be just like her daaaddddyyyy
370436341000986600,Thu Aug 22 06:44:40 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow I haven't made one baby thing yet somehow! It takes all I have just to get work stuff done though, whoops

370334958654459900,Thu Aug 22 00:01:49 +0000 2013,Boo to surprise unnoticed gashes in the middle of fabric! It's hard to investigate like 50 feet of fabric to make sure it's all okay
370317672136724500,Wed Aug 21 22:53:07 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow that's funny! Well that's a good week for a birthday I think

369889567966388200,Tue Aug 20 18:31:59 +0000 2013,Sorry for all the pregnancy topics. But do those odd preggo pillows really help? I think I'll get more sleep when the baby is actually here!
369579570132840450,Mon Aug 19 22:00:10 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow @arrowandapple so I have to control my snack dreams a lot, ha ha
369579462548938750,Mon Aug 19 21:59:44 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow @arrowandapple I have spent five minutes now dreaming about chocolate. I'm a 5 min walk from trader joes AND whole foods...
369577916696256500,Mon Aug 19 21:53:36 +0000 2013,What does it say about me if all I want for my birthday is a haircut?

369510538440495100,Mon Aug 19 17:25:52 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I got the brown &amp; its a nice color in person! Why baby stuff has to be so ugly is weird. Babies have no style preferences!
369509579773599740,Mon Aug 19 17:22:03 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple at a consignment store and got it. The mobile arm thing is removable too! http://t.co/ZW9psj1QQh
369509549947904000,Mon Aug 19 17:21:56 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I thought of you when I found this not-so-ugly baby thing! I thought it was nice &amp; then I came across it
369315870314471400,Mon Aug 19 04:32:19 +0000 2013,I am super extra thankful tonight for all of the awesome friends we have. This baby doesn't even know how lucky she is yet!
369242215219855360,Sun Aug 18 23:39:38 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow if we haven't moved by the time the baby outgrows bassinet size that's my plan! We have a little hallway/nook the perfect dize
369233687398719500,Sun Aug 18 23:05:45 +0000 2013,Hey I actually still have a blog, weird. http://t.co/tUrldmAMVb

369199619734921200,Sun Aug 18 20:50:23 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow we are waiting on a couple places we really like, but that could mean we will be in barely over 500 sq ft with a baby, ha ha
368749165267800060,Sat Aug 17 15:00:26 +0000 2013,@danihampton awww that's awesome!!! And you guys make the cutest babies in the world! Good job ;)
368499413057933300,Fri Aug 16 22:28:01 +0000 2013,@tessfine I'm not sure! I don't even know how much it matters, unless you're in a hot tub forever or something. So many weird "rules"!
368462382009286660,Fri Aug 16 20:00:52 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox I know!! Ha ha last night he even got out my thermometer for making lattes and checked the dang water, ha ha ha
368459370721316860,Fri Aug 16 19:48:54 +0000 2013,Patrick runs a bath for me every night. But thanks to the stupid Internet he learned the recommended temp&amp;length and strictly enforces it!
368457937427001340,Fri Aug 16 19:43:12 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox you need the opposite of caffeine! Things to make you want to be less productive. So a donut should do the trick!
368452947014721540,Fri Aug 16 19:23:22 +0000 2013,I had coffee for the first time on Monday, now I'm having some cold brew. I think I am about to get one million things done! Caffeine!!!
368188673784676350,Fri Aug 16 01:53:15 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow that's when I end up coming home with frozen things to eat, ha ha.

368144238258573300,Thu Aug 15 22:56:40 +0000 2013,Maddie has a delightful habit of randomly growling at kids. And 10 minutes later loving them&amp;kissing them. It makes for a loooong 10 minutes
368068255870513150,Thu Aug 15 17:54:45 +0000 2013,@josh_dies oh no! That moso is such a good babysitter!

368057662002315260,Thu Aug 15 17:12:39 +0000 2013,Currently attempting to organize our apartment. So pretty much don't come over for days. Can professional rearrangers/organizers come over?
368054236602327040,Thu Aug 15 16:59:02 +0000 2013,@KacieCollection holy cow!!! That's crazy, 9 minutes! I am still super up in the air about medication/not or anything labor wise!
368043757939064800,Thu Aug 15 16:17:24 +0000 2013,@KacieCollection I can't decide! But it seems nice to have the option. Did you have natural births?
368028861788745700,Thu Aug 15 15:18:12 +0000 2013,@KacieCollection awww,those babies with a mind of their own! And they do, the pools are so huge too. I'll just take a swim, they'd love that

365316570001584100,Thu Aug 08 03:40:32 +0000 2013,@malwarning are you using a co sleeper or anything? Researching baby stuff leads down too many rabbit holes!!

365296340361691140,Thu Aug 08 02:20:09 +0000 2013,Firm mattress, no blankets/toys/etc, after that what is there left that's not safe? How do you avoid the path of the paranoid parent!?
365295815637483500,Thu Aug 08 02:18:03 +0000 2013,We have a vintage pram to use as a bassinet for the first couple months, but now I'm all paranoid after reading safety things about sleeping

362629759915671550,Wed Jul 31 17:44:06 +0000 2013,I just submitted Maddie's story to @thiswildidea. Maybe I cry a little if I think too much about her fluffy feets and brown eyes. Whoopsies.
362373948698144800,Wed Jul 31 00:47:36 +0000 2013,@calivintage oh made a dress out of CHEAP fabric. The colors bled from my sweaty underarms, and then eventually ripped. While on a plane.
362021358017839100,Tue Jul 30 01:26:32 +0000 2013,@jenloveskev I think it's going to take me awhile! I'm interested to see what my total weight gain will be when the baby is done cooking!
362009360391618560,Tue Jul 30 00:38:51 +0000 2013,@coreywarning it's all a conspiracy man! Trying to keep us down. But really, that sucks. Health ins feels like a big false promise

361251473780256800,Sat Jul 27 22:27:17 +0000 2013,What is a good stroller? And not the ones that are a million dollars please. We do a whole lot of walking around here!

360862047216476160,Fri Jul 26 20:39:51 +0000 2013,Someone keyed our car today! Well, jokes on you. Maddie already scratched up our nice new car, and we don't even care. What an odd "prank"
360792248759222300,Fri Jul 26 16:02:29 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple oh I feel you!! Now I'm to the point where everything just aches! Sleeping on my back/stomach sounds so good I could cry!

360457404351127550,Thu Jul 25 17:51:56 +0000 2013,I think I want to do crafty wonderland this winter...am I nuts? I figure if I start stockpiling in Aug, Sept, &amp; Oct I can do it in December!
360427206230556700,Thu Jul 25 15:51:57 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox You said I had to wear it until the baby came. That's so rude of you.
360427180745965600,Thu Jul 25 15:51:50 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox in my dream you gave me a weird sweater to wear but I didn't know how to say it was ugly.

360143092612997100,Wed Jul 24 21:02:59 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow she has more than apologized with the amount of hugs. Dogs can just love babies sometimes!!!
360141955663011840,Wed Jul 24 20:58:28 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple @RachelDenbow maddie ate the couch days before we found out about the baby! Then she has snuggled me nonstop since then!

359425066758451200,Mon Jul 22 21:29:48 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple hey that's what we did today! Well, without the crib buying. It was boring things like a new knife and a garbage can

359066081207398400,Sun Jul 21 21:43:19 +0000 2013,@karahaupt maybe he toned it down for the day. I was sad when I saw what a nice house he lived in. We're in the wrong profession
359060749622050800,Sun Jul 21 21:22:08 +0000 2013,@karahaupt well, it was the same guy as long as you're talking about the one who wears the darth vader mask at the same time
359050462269423600,Sun Jul 21 20:41:15 +0000 2013,@karahaupt got to hear him practicing all the time..........
359050415842660350,Sun Jul 21 20:41:04 +0000 2013,@karahaupt the bagpipe guy used to be our neighbor before we moved to NW. So I know where he lives if you need to pay him a visit.
358074104701648900,Fri Jul 19 04:01:33 +0000 2013,Ha! Just heard a pickup line from a guy outside our window, "pick me up! If you don't its littering." So... is he saying he's trash?
357710281075462140,Thu Jul 18 03:55:51 +0000 2013,No, dude with all the face tattoos, I am not 8 months pregnant. (He was actually really nice, just clueless!)

356105255924142100,Sat Jul 13 17:38:03 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox ha ha!!!!!
356104644608532500,Sat Jul 13 17:35:38 +0000 2013,Uhhhh @friendly_fox I need some more of that strawberry climates like cheesecake ice cream. And NOW!
356100225175261200,Sat Jul 13 17:18:04 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I think the bladder just turns into someone's personal trampoline!
356098939944050700,Sat Jul 13 17:12:57 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple I never knew you could see so much! And apparently going in with a full bladder can help ;) Which I always have anyway, ha ha
356097970187415550,Sat Jul 13 17:09:06 +0000 2013,@arrowandapple get ready, the ultrasound is SO fun! &amp; so long, you get to see things so tiny, like freaking HEART VALVES, on pea-sized heart
355755358897180700,Fri Jul 12 18:27:41 +0000 2013,@friendly_fox ha ha!! You're so disgusting.
355740386355974140,Fri Jul 12 17:28:12 +0000 2013,Any tips on getting good sleep while incubating a human? Because that's just not happening anymore.
355531350398349300,Fri Jul 12 03:37:34 +0000 2013,@mariaconfer has the chair faded very much or is the dye pretty set?
355530851787866100,Fri Jul 12 03:35:35 +0000 2013,@mariaconfer having a white puppy rules out anything too dark, our navy rug is a nightmare!  Grey couches area also pretty dreamy
355530101926010900,Fri Jul 12 03:32:36 +0000 2013,@mariaconfer I for the life of me cannot decide on a color though! Your chair did turn out a pretty amazing shade,that might be on the list!
355529231821832200,Fri Jul 12 03:29:08 +0000 2013,@mariaconfer I am trying out your dying/tufting/new leg trick on a couch this week, lets hope it turns out as awesome as your chair!
355477868257624060,Fri Jul 12 00:05:02 +0000 2013,@powersurf it's called elimination communication and I have no idea how that would work!
355475539429040100,Thu Jul 11 23:55:47 +0000 2013,@powersurf @vanillaandlace that is a real thing. Well not the kitty kit, but people who have babies use the toilet. Like hold them over it
355475168820338700,Thu Jul 11 23:54:19 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace I mean unless you're comparing it to a crappy brand of disposables!
355474929367515140,Thu Jul 11 23:53:22 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace diapers, haha. But I am really worried its a ton of extra work. If we had our very own washer&amp;dryer I might be more inclined
355474867686084600,Thu Jul 11 23:53:07 +0000 2013,@vanillaandlace it definitely would he cheaper in the long run (I have crunched numbers for HOURS). Unless you're getting like... IGA brand
355470303708721150,Thu Jul 11 23:34:59 +0000 2013,Testing out the new couch (that will soon look completely different) http://t.co/MFwtLZJ5vf

355225044433125400,Thu Jul 11 07:20:25 +0000 2013,Going to dye a white couch cover, but have NO idea what color! There's no other decor to base it off of, because a new rug is on the horizon
355224262027657200,Thu Jul 11 07:17:18 +0000 2013,@karahaupt it seems like some scare tactics are involved there a little. I'm sure a lot is true, but I'm sure some of it is pretty one sided
355047425515339800,Wed Jul 10 19:34:37 +0000 2013,@darbycisneros Well maddie is sitting next to me bathing a blanket. So I'd say its just an all around good sign for the day!

353191843816673300,Fri Jul 05 16:41:12 +0000 2013,A no sugar fast starts today! Wish me luck.
352856044919193600,Thu Jul 04 18:26:51 +0000 2013,Wanted to swim today but misplaced all my bikini tops. Then I realized there's no way they're going to fit anyway! Ahh the things that grow
352665408458866700,Thu Jul 04 05:49:20 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole I brew it overnight in a mason jar. I actually wrote about it forever ago! http://t.co/2ftE2421xD
352664532742705150,Thu Jul 04 05:45:51 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole I usually just put it in the French press after it soaks! But you have to press it really slowly or it can explode all over,ha

352470774172495900,Wed Jul 03 16:55:55 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole cold brew!!! Yummmm. If you want to die, add cinnamon and some brown sugar.
352470346944872450,Wed Jul 03 16:54:13 +0000 2013,@RachelDenbow dang, what did your mom do to make her so mad...
352468969464135700,Wed Jul 03 16:48:45 +0000 2013,So last night we decided to cut Maddie's hair ourselves. Well turns out we aren't groomers! Everything looks good, then you see the tail...
352224201677090800,Wed Jul 03 00:36:08 +0000 2013,@_sarahnicole I think as a kid I cried at every other meal from doing this, you'd think I would've learned by now!
351816287976030200,Mon Jul 01 21:35:14 +0000 2013,@powersurf or try Canada and most of Europe where you pay nothing, for just as high of quality care. That's nuts.

350278121548816400,Thu Jun 27 15:43:06 +0000 2013,@kaelahbee So I was forced to use it everywhere else. It's not a big deal it just look funny
350278082046853100,Thu Jun 27 15:42:57 +0000 2013,@kaelahbee somewhere they used my maiden name as an initial after my middle name. I think on my ss card.

349603341980016640,Tue Jun 25 19:01:46 +0000 2013,@honeykennedy yeah, it's so bad!! And throwing a dog into the mix sure doesn't help either. But new places are always exciting to me!
349598283464847360,Tue Jun 25 18:41:40 +0000 2013,So we have to decide by the weekend if we are moving in 30 days or going month-month on our current place. Ahhh!!!!

224188762551353340,Sat Jul 14 17:09:00 +0000 2012,Dear sisters (neither of whom is on twitter), please move here. I asked nicely! There are some days a good sister hangout just sounds right.

223954272595886080,Sat Jul 14 01:37:14 +0000 2012,For those of you who own tiny people, they would probably greatly enjoy being clothed from here! http://t.co/wwbOW7vF @vanillaandlace

223603568991670270,Fri Jul 13 02:23:39 +0000 2012,@ticktockvint ha, I guess that would be worse! Patrick also announced very loudly, as he bent down to smell me, that I stunk. That same trip
223603093038825470,Fri Jul 13 02:21:46 +0000 2012,When its so warm I always feel too tired to do anything. 85 degrees isn't hot, I'm aware. But it is when you have no air conditioning!
