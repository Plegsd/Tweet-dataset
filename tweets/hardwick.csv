841518402690662400,Tue Mar 14 05:16:36 +0000 2017,@dantelfer @united the crazy thing is that when something is left on a plane, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. We'll never fly them again.

841516790819635200,Tue Mar 14 05:10:12 +0000 2017,@IdealGasLaw well when your loved one loses something that's irreplaceable then see how snarky you are about the bad customer service

841512436213542900,Tue Mar 14 04:52:53 +0000 2017,@united hey United, there HAS to be a better way to get something back before it disappears forever. Especially if you need it asap.

841411275900911600,Mon Mar 13 22:10:55 +0000 2017,@shazzzzakhan I would apply the same gif to someone who doesn't have to watch it but complains about it anyway. ;)
841411095189364700,Mon Mar 13 22:10:12 +0000 2017,@xxM0l0xx but going out of your way to insult another human being to feel superior about yourself is a-ok though, right Stephen? Nice! :)
841410235373768700,Mon Mar 13 22:06:47 +0000 2017,@Daviesman hi! sadly, we can never be live in the UK because of the time difference. This show won't be live here either, though!
841410016439488500,Mon Mar 13 22:05:55 +0000 2017,@eavoss hey! watched your Logan video! Dumb question...they only upgraded Laura's claws to adamantium and not her ENTIRE skeleton, right?
841389214000279600,Mon Mar 13 20:43:15 +0000 2017,@EvilAngelVideo @Engine26Studios @midnight @adrianachechik I saw Dan's tweet first. This all makes a lot more sense after seeing the rest.
841388639166767100,Mon Mar 13 20:40:58 +0000 2017,@TongueInCheekSF you should have just started giving wrong information and fake spoilers!
841350378880819200,Mon Mar 13 18:08:56 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto I certainly don't hate you over a tweet. Be well. :)
841349897685090300,Mon Mar 13 18:07:01 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto ...then I must respectfully disagree with you and say good day. Take care! :)
841349777367347200,Mon Mar 13 18:06:33 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto but if you would rather double down on your statement than even TRY to see that it might have been a tad rude...
841349471963238400,Mon Mar 13 18:05:20 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto and the supposition of your statement is that I am a liar, which is equally insulting and not true. That's the point, Adam.
841349210309972000,Mon Mar 13 18:04:17 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto Telling someone what they are definitely thinking is NOT the same thing. If someone did that to you you'd HATE it.
841348761771102200,Mon Mar 13 18:02:30 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto But I'll take your word that you didn't mean anything by it and wish you a better day. :)
841348573203591200,Mon Mar 13 18:01:46 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto I mean I responded with the EXACT SAME TONE you sent out and you didn't like it. It's just not very nice, is all.
841348073016053800,Mon Mar 13 17:59:46 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto hate the show, that's fine! It's your absolute right. But please don't pin your opinions in my head. You wouldn't like it.
841347859769253900,Mon Mar 13 17:58:55 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto thank you but that doesn't justify the rudeness of acting like 1) you know what's in my head and 2) that I'm lying about it.
841345712730198000,Mon Mar 13 17:50:24 +0000 2017,@SewellToronto it's painfully obvious you have no clue or real facts about me but want to talk like you do because hey, internet.

839873074627432400,Thu Mar 09 16:18:39 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint but PLEASE do not take this as an insult or an attack on you or what you do. Journos like you HAVE to fight the good fight!
839872850274103300,Thu Mar 09 16:17:46 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint and btw, I include myself in that group who's had bad experiences.
839872677716230100,Thu Mar 09 16:17:05 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint You have to remember that to us, we're one person talking to them but to THEM, we're 1 of thousands who are not all great.
839872381816455200,Thu Mar 09 16:15:54 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint ...can be exploited so they're protective. Not by real journalist folks like yourself, but a few bad apples spoil the barrel.
839872184499609600,Thu Mar 09 16:15:07 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint almost every one of them has some bad experience where they were burned by someone trying to get a scoop. these folks...
839871974977368000,Thu Mar 09 16:14:17 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint w/ all due respect, most of the people who come on don't like the word. The reason being that interviews usually have an agenda.
839871553374347300,Thu Mar 09 16:12:37 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint my openly explaining my process to you isn't my crapping on anyone else. I'm just sharing what works for me b/c you asked. :)
839871012158095400,Thu Mar 09 16:10:28 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint and I don't consider myself a journo not as an insult but b/c it's a skillset I don't have. I don't do research or have a plan.
839870335444930600,Thu Mar 09 16:07:46 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint it's not narrow minded...it's my opinion. not crapping on journos. it's just how I do it and I'd have to say it works for me :)
839860321934176300,Thu Mar 09 15:27:59 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint Ok thanks again! Have a nice day!!! :)
839860270742712300,Thu Mar 09 15:27:47 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint ...you really get to know them a bit better than if they were reciting answers to a bullet point list of questions.
839860028228067300,Thu Mar 09 15:26:49 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint PS: by "defensive" I mean "protective". Conversation's casual comfort level helps people lower their shields and open up so...
839859423505891300,Thu Mar 09 15:24:25 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint ...start talking and I kind of just let it go where it does depending on their energy. Hope that helps! Thank you for listening!
839859157888966700,Thu Mar 09 15:23:21 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint ...like you're meeting someone for coffee is a more relaxed setting. Also, they're never planned beforehand. We sit down...
839858929756577800,Thu Mar 09 15:22:27 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint interviews are very one-way, and most people don't enjoy being questioned for an hour straight. A conversation that feels...
839858743202373600,Thu Mar 09 15:21:42 +0000 2017,@HannaFlint Mainly because I'm not a journalist. And interviews create a more defensive, interrogation-like environment than conversations.

836708028250382300,Tue Feb 28 22:41:53 +0000 2017,@BlowUpRadio but for you to report to people that I'm a jerk who blocked you out of hate is equally disappointing.

836707026130493400,Tue Feb 28 22:37:54 +0000 2017,@BlowUpRadio attack tactics are not okay. So you're actually supporting the opposite of what you claim. No hate from my end at all! :)
836706798581141500,Tue Feb 28 22:37:00 +0000 2017,@BlowUpRadio I blocked because they flat out called me a trump puppet w/ a photoshop pic. Maybe don't insult people you want to help you?

835643231819817000,Sun Feb 26 00:10:46 +0000 2017,@Bromodrosis hahaha AGREED
835599403528302600,Sat Feb 25 21:16:37 +0000 2017,@MeAndNintendo Right?? Such a great film with an original story. Jordan knocked it out of the park.

835022781146259500,Fri Feb 24 07:05:19 +0000 2017,@dizzyeyed so I got help. Sober friends, a good therapist. AA works for a lot of people--you need a solid support structure.
835022539705339900,Fri Feb 24 07:04:22 +0000 2017,@dizzyeyed ...and I decided that I wanted to try for something better. A life I could design and be in control of my decisions.
835022051664515100,Fri Feb 24 07:02:25 +0000 2017,@dizzyeyed this is going to sound overly simplified, but it was largely that I knew exactly where a live w/ alcohol was going to lead me...

834808913505628200,Thu Feb 23 16:55:29 +0000 2017,@DanielRusteau could I use the same gif to throw back at you for skipping the intro where we gave a spoiler warning but still complained?

834460620812546000,Wed Feb 22 17:51:30 +0000 2017,@JulieSHill66 I don't! I think they're different. Whisperers appear way later in the comics' story line.

834170190258516000,Tue Feb 21 22:37:26 +0000 2017,@pjaluthor are you SERIOUSLY suggesting I don't know that? You DO NOT refer to film specific events w/ the blanket term Star Wars.

833833933854830600,Tue Feb 21 00:21:16 +0000 2017,@CiscoShawn so you can say that something is part of SW or in its universe but you wouldn't refer to specific events in films that way
833833621924425700,Tue Feb 21 00:20:02 +0000 2017,@CiscoShawn We're right! People forget that "A New Hope" wasn't the name of the first film until 1981. It was just "Star Wars" before that.

833825423473512400,Mon Feb 20 23:47:27 +0000 2017,@MarionGrey44 please go antagonize to feel better elsewhere. That is clearly your goal today. Take care! :)
833825253360963600,Mon Feb 20 23:46:46 +0000 2017,@MarionGrey44 omg are you referring to a screw up from 5 years ago?? And I'm no expert on eps 1-3. I saw them all once and that was enough.
833824961743630300,Mon Feb 20 23:45:37 +0000 2017,@MarionGrey44 it's just negativity for negativity's sake. And you may have noticed, but there is quite enough of that in the world right now
833824742243131400,Mon Feb 20 23:44:44 +0000 2017,@MarionGrey44 and telling someone something is "unlistenable" isn't actionable at all. I don't know that person or his/her preferences.
833824631412793300,Mon Feb 20 23:44:18 +0000 2017,@MarionGrey44 uh huh. maybe try it on the scale of feedback someone with millions of followers gets and then get back to me ;)
