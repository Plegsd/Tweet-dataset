649783446668243000,Fri Oct 02 03:10:20 +0000 2015,@josper1975 Australia had a terrible mass shooting. The reason they don't have a recent history with shootings is they acted.

649782941162324000,Fri Oct 02 03:08:20 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand my theory: the next big terror attack will not involve a bomb or a plane but a legally purchased weapon. Things will change.
649782679555166200,Fri Oct 02 03:07:17 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand is it not possible that the reason is more access to guns?

649782370409803800,Fri Oct 02 03:06:04 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand and the numbers are telling - we have the most guns and the highest gun violence rate in the world. That's what gets me.
649782007795425300,Fri Oct 02 03:04:37 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand and I can definitely concur that handling a bat is a crime whenever I try to play baseball lol
649781696146067500,Fri Oct 02 03:03:23 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand so can you kinda see my point there? It's the tool of choice for someone wanting to inflict mass casualties.

649781042975522800,Fri Oct 02 03:00:47 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand how many people were killed in mass vehicle killings this year? Not accidents - purposeful murders?
649780824460685300,Fri Oct 02 02:59:55 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand is it just sad? Or is it sad and preventable? Is it foolish to suggest that perhaps we look at what other countries have done
649780532344160300,Fri Oct 02 02:58:45 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand but I agree with you - most gun owners are law abiding. But how do you explain the higher RATE of gun violence?
649780200255959000,Fri Oct 02 02:57:26 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand yeahhhhh but I wonder about the sincerity of that argument sometimes Julie. Is a bat as deadly as an assault weapon?
649779956726284300,Fri Oct 02 02:56:28 +0000 2015,@JLHelterbrand yes violent crime is lower than some countries but the subject of the article is gun violence. Did you see those numbers?

649773451671171100,Fri Oct 02 02:30:37 +0000 2015,@avabhullar_ excellent. Good info there, thanks not
649772374074740700,Fri Oct 02 02:26:20 +0000 2015,@malikress sorry! Hi!
649772182860656600,Fri Oct 02 02:25:35 +0000 2015,@_SmallBump_ haha thanks!!!
649772138119995400,Fri Oct 02 02:25:24 +0000 2015,@salconlan 😎
649771993395499000,Fri Oct 02 02:24:50 +0000 2015,@DispatchesUSA @julescator oh yeah they've got good reason to be afraid. Remember Gabby Giffords?
649771759890243600,Fri Oct 02 02:23:54 +0000 2015,@Sarahdr0930 @Oceanwave1998 I try. It's really really difficult sometimes and I have to use the delete button a lot haha
649771620307992600,Fri Oct 02 02:23:21 +0000 2015,@Supyro oh trust me, they hate that argument. The only people people like her hate more than people like me are "other countries"
649771135559692300,Fri Oct 02 02:21:25 +0000 2015,@Nate_Turnbull well, it's nowadays a political movement based on anger, fear of change, fear of powerful minorities and "the past".
649770660282114000,Fri Oct 02 02:19:32 +0000 2015,@BrianJSBrasil yes terribly
649770610491531300,Fri Oct 02 02:19:20 +0000 2015,@MaskaCW nail on head.
649770508561567700,Fri Oct 02 02:18:56 +0000 2015,@Allyn101 I think they'd rather be wrong and dead than admit they're wrong. It's old pioneer mentality. I grew up in the south, I get it.
649770192994725900,Fri Oct 02 02:17:40 +0000 2015,@ChrisHayesNY well there's where the helplessness comes in. The response will be the same. They'll get angry at him.
649769944939372500,Fri Oct 02 02:16:41 +0000 2015,@Allyn101 oh wow I didn't know that
649769886164602900,Fri Oct 02 02:16:27 +0000 2015,@DispatchesUSA @julescator they're terrified of them.
649769523109830700,Fri Oct 02 02:15:01 +0000 2015,@_SmallBump_ 👊
649769456198123500,Fri Oct 02 02:14:45 +0000 2015,@Moksh_ can't say yet, but they'll announce it when it's all finalized
649769334672371700,Fri Oct 02 02:14:16 +0000 2015,@Oceanwave1998 well, it is a public forum nonetheless - I think if approached with emotional correctness it can be healing to talk it out
649769071781806100,Fri Oct 02 02:13:13 +0000 2015,@Moksh_ I'm not far behind haha
649769010893058000,Fri Oct 02 02:12:58 +0000 2015,@ChrisHayesNY @BrooksBunny he did. The sadness and frustration, all of it was there.
649768757833924600,Fri Oct 02 02:11:58 +0000 2015,@thedeathtower19 unfortunately many Americans are deeply nationalistic, and would rather be wrong than follow another country's lead.
649768436445376500,Fri Oct 02 02:10:42 +0000 2015,@KELLANRHYS I wonder how many lives that has saved? And the irony of treating gun shot wounds while fully armed is staggering.
649768171726065700,Fri Oct 02 02:09:38 +0000 2015,@Allyn101 I think because they're angry and somehow think people like me (east coast liberals) look down on them and want to control them
649767957401370600,Fri Oct 02 02:08:47 +0000 2015,@DispatchesUSA @julescator well I live in NYC so yeah haha.

649767304390164500,Fri Oct 02 02:06:12 +0000 2015,@thedeathtower19 maybe start by seeing what other counties have done to keep mass shooting events rare?
649767086403792900,Fri Oct 02 02:05:20 +0000 2015,@MANX38 😙 sooooorrry haha
649766954945892400,Fri Oct 02 02:04:48 +0000 2015,@_SmallBump_ yeah I saw it a few times. I'm surprised Moore hasn't been taken out by the gun lobby yet.
649766710002778100,Fri Oct 02 02:03:50 +0000 2015,@salconlan maybe
649766574950367200,Fri Oct 02 02:03:18 +0000 2015,@PoloKiidd_ thanks man!!
649766470554120200,Fri Oct 02 02:02:53 +0000 2015,@MaskaCW I wonder why that doesn't impress people here in the states? It's really strange.

649765494560530400,Fri Oct 02 01:59:00 +0000 2015,@ChrisHayesNY hey buddy!
649765425383911400,Fri Oct 02 01:58:44 +0000 2015,@KELLANRHYS i wonder if she thinks you should be forced to carry?
649765204939702300,Fri Oct 02 01:57:51 +0000 2015,@julescator @DispatchesUSA having spent a lot of time in Europe I concur
649765098752487400,Fri Oct 02 01:57:26 +0000 2015,@BrooksBunny then why are you yelling at me? Do you think that will change my mind?

649764166773948400,Fri Oct 02 01:53:44 +0000 2015,@BrooksBunny oh honey. You're so angry.
649763964423929900,Fri Oct 02 01:52:55 +0000 2015,@mercadoodles what do you mean?
649763745246355500,Fri Oct 02 01:52:03 +0000 2015,@DispatchesUSA @julescator nah, not at all - but I'm a realist to, and I think the gun lobby in this country is more powerful than congress
649763454887268400,Fri Oct 02 01:50:54 +0000 2015,@BrooksBunny not nice. How can we have a decent talk that starts with an insult? You make your side look childish.
649763337060896800,Fri Oct 02 01:50:26 +0000 2015,Awwww. She thinks I'm stupid. 😞 No civil discourse from gun supporters? Not one?  https://t.co/bebSlTGdJi

649760543981600800,Fri Oct 02 01:39:20 +0000 2015,@DispatchesUSA @julescator for my own peace of mind? Yes. Because I think demonizing the other side makes it worse.
649760299059388400,Fri Oct 02 01:38:21 +0000 2015,@julescator I might be the only member of my family who doesn't own a gun. And I live in Harlem lol.
649759936637988900,Fri Oct 02 01:36:55 +0000 2015,@DispatchesUSA I'm trying to understand the gun folks right now, get their side of it.
649759720127991800,Fri Oct 02 01:36:03 +0000 2015,@henrycavrll hi
649759570781413400,Fri Oct 02 01:35:28 +0000 2015,@Moksh_ well I'm trying to honestly understand what they're thinking here. They truly think it's the only answer.
649759389314891800,Fri Oct 02 01:34:45 +0000 2015,@karerv hi good luck!
649759098691526700,Fri Oct 02 01:33:35 +0000 2015,@MooreDj1 question: do you think it's a good idea for teachers in England and Australia to be armed, considering the low gun violence rate?
649758847251402800,Fri Oct 02 01:32:35 +0000 2015,@MooreDj1 why are you trying to inflame the rhetoric here? I'm trying very hard to have a decent conversation with you.
649758493898068000,Fri Oct 02 01:31:11 +0000 2015,@_SmallBump_ or at this point something, anything - even just to know that Washington cares.

649755777201250300,Fri Oct 02 01:20:23 +0000 2015,@MooreDj1 but - are you willing to legislate that all teachers must be armed? And is gun teachers choice?

649754194417709000,Fri Oct 02 01:14:06 +0000 2015,@MooreDj1 how do we know that that wouldn't create possibly deadly situations in classrooms? Should the teacher have it in holster or lock
649753907288272900,Fri Oct 02 01:12:57 +0000 2015,@daredevrl @brianjsmth haha sweet. Hi
649753794889285600,Fri Oct 02 01:12:31 +0000 2015,@MooreDj1 so would arming teachers be something that should be mandatory?
649753396073865200,Fri Oct 02 01:10:56 +0000 2015,@Moksh_ I saw that - aamazing. Unfortunately making fun of them just digs the Trench deeper.
649753165353631700,Fri Oct 02 01:10:01 +0000 2015,@ArcticFox_am_I thus the helpless feeling. Even just on Twitter - the reactions to even suggesting regulations are swift and unbendable
649752857776910300,Fri Oct 02 01:08:47 +0000 2015,@ideesinvitro yes yes definitely
649752672069898200,Fri Oct 02 01:08:03 +0000 2015,@BrittYo3 even the people who weren't injured/killed - the emotional trauma.
649752400719429600,Fri Oct 02 01:06:58 +0000 2015,@gabxzed I think we should be able to get basic regulations going. Not too much to ask.

649751721871298600,Fri Oct 02 01:04:16 +0000 2015,@MooreDj1 unfortunately the kid who shot up that school was law abiding --- until he wasn't.
