189392708694061060,Mon Apr 09 16:41:55 +0000 2012,@itsme_addie This is a palette by MAC?!? Are you a makeup artist? If not, I think there are too many shades for just one person! :)
189391625666039800,Mon Apr 09 16:37:36 +0000 2012,@8Anna22 Yes! Great lipsticks!

189389610688847870,Mon Apr 09 16:29:36 +0000 2012,@Tooscha I don't have a specific shade that I love by itself but as far as variety goes, I think Mac and Nars make the most beautiful reds:)

163045359617187840,Fri Jan 27 23:46:57 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto Best way to tell is by the pigment. Do you have to rub a shadow hard to get color on your brush? Does your lipstick stay on?

161824820428931070,Tue Jan 24 14:56:58 +0000 2012,@8Anna22 There's always photoshop. Always. Although it isn't always used in the way you might think. Very little on this one.
161823952270925820,Tue Jan 24 14:53:31 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel It's not all makeup, actually, although there's bronzer involved for sure. She tans naturally to a beautiful color.

161525887974637570,Mon Jan 23 19:09:07 +0000 2012,There's nothing wrong with her makeup. It's fine I'm just sick of the "adorkable" thing & it looks silly on the cover of Allure. Not Allure!
161525176616484860,Mon Jan 23 19:06:17 +0000 2012,I am such a huge fan of Allure magazine and their covers and the entire creative team but I don't understand ...This is a terrible photo!!!!

160052156941082620,Thu Jan 19 17:33:02 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel One of the best eye makeup removers out there but you have to shake it before each use. I'm sure it says that on the bottle!

159695430832242700,Wed Jan 18 17:55:32 +0000 2012,@ElizabethHamil3 Sure. But it's all relative. What may seem like bad makeup to me might be somebody else's favorite look. For example, I...
159694972134764540,Wed Jan 18 17:53:43 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel Yes. Try Jojoba oil from the health food store ;)

159054428912099330,Mon Jan 16 23:28:25 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel If you use it dry, use a natural hair brush. If you want to use it wet, use a small synthetic brush. Two different finishes.

159044637175185400,Mon Jan 16 22:49:31 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel Nope. Get in the habit of using eye cream regularly if moisture is a concern for you. Primers don't have to be drying ;)
159042277287788540,Mon Jan 16 22:40:08 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto That is very hard to answer. I LOVE that I can do it all more than anything but if I had to choose only 1, I'd say I photo shoot

158632415844245500,Sun Jan 15 19:31:29 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel Hahaha! You're welcome! Yes, much better, thank you!

158301191334412300,Sat Jan 14 21:35:19 +0000 2012,@loudandfearless it's a latex adhesive like lash glue. You can find it at a beauty supply store or on line.
158296611162824700,Sat Jan 14 21:17:07 +0000 2012,@loudandfearless is it a front-lace wig? If not. Have you tried surgical adhesive?
158247689002299400,Sat Jan 14 18:02:43 +0000 2012,@8Anna22 not today. Boob gold dust, tomorrow! :)

157988641916989440,Sat Jan 14 00:53:22 +0000 2012,@carlota_bl Feliz A√±o!
157982479255470080,Sat Jan 14 00:28:52 +0000 2012,@8Anna22 way too many things on my plate right now so...stress would be my diagnosis :) Stress keeps me from tweeting!!! Hahaha
157979421641412600,Sat Jan 14 00:16:43 +0000 2012,Sleep is probably the #1 beauty tip. Last night I got zero sleep which means today, my face looks like s#*@t and I wanted u to know that :)
157961021154275330,Fri Jan 13 23:03:36 +0000 2012,@albantravia @katewalsh yes! We do too!

157942090767151100,Fri Jan 13 21:48:23 +0000 2012,@Pitchousse beautiful photo!
157941926883098620,Fri Jan 13 21:47:44 +0000 2012,@albantravia I was in Spain for Christmas with Stephen and my family but now @katewalsh and I are back at work in LA. Enjoy your holiday!!
157581971671879680,Thu Jan 12 21:57:24 +0000 2012,@Phine111 I should have been more clear. I meant a dark liner on pale lips left unblended. Such a tragic look :(
157579938453655550,Thu Jan 12 21:49:19 +0000 2012,@Phine111 women who use a lip liner to draw an "actual" line around their lips make me want to run far and fast!
157274099310272500,Thu Jan 12 01:34:01 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto nope! Private Practice today :)
157268702360899600,Thu Jan 12 01:12:35 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto she nails it time after time which means I touch her up time after time :-)
157267657631084540,Thu Jan 12 01:08:26 +0000 2012,@kab1210 You are so welcome! ;)
157267591168135170,Thu Jan 12 01:08:10 +0000 2012,@albantravia Doing well, my friend. How are you? Happy new year!! :)
157267468577017860,Thu Jan 12 01:07:41 +0000 2012,@patri_xDD Buena, Buena?? YSL, Cle De Pau, Chanel, Shiseido etc...
157266790848802800,Thu Jan 12 01:04:59 +0000 2012,@AlisonDaulerio I didn't!! I don't know what's going on or how to fix it!!! :(
157266653929930750,Thu Jan 12 01:04:26 +0000 2012,@Pitchousse It's optional. Put these lashes on after curling and after mascara then if you want, apply another coat to blend together :)
157266281211510800,Thu Jan 12 01:02:57 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto Yes. When Addison moved to LA, I changed her look to a more "California" look. Good eye! ;-)
156473675212800000,Mon Jan 09 20:33:25 +0000 2012,@kittenchopsUK never heard that one before!
156463988924887040,Mon Jan 09 19:54:56 +0000 2012,@8Anna22 You mean you drink lots of beer for your skin? :)
156463608988053500,Mon Jan 09 19:53:25 +0000 2012,@LisyMaje If you do try it. Please let me know how you like it :)
156463496144502800,Mon Jan 09 19:52:59 +0000 2012,@LisyMaje Try "the Falsies" by Maybelline. I've heard it's awesome! ;) http://t.co/HjMbr8U3
156461085619269630,Mon Jan 09 19:43:24 +0000 2012,@Phine111 Thank you! :)
156461014085402620,Mon Jan 09 19:43:07 +0000 2012,@8Anna22 I am trying Viviscal right now and really like it. There are all kinds of hair/nail vitamins that anyone can take ;)
156460366468104200,Mon Jan 09 19:40:32 +0000 2012,@oimelchen Yes. I really like that sponge but I prefer a good set of brushes. I'll take a good foundation brush over sponges any day!
156459813004521470,Mon Jan 09 19:38:20 +0000 2012,@LisyMaje When you say "weak", what do you mean? Short? Flimsy?
156459467171577860,Mon Jan 09 19:36:58 +0000 2012,@iamEmmaWilde Yes! find a thickening mascara. buy a lash comb to comb lashes in between coats and apply a couple of coats :)
156458188345061380,Mon Jan 09 19:31:53 +0000 2012,@AnnikaEddens909 in the exact same way as regular products. Pay attention at how your skin reacts. you may like them and you  may not.
156456984131014660,Mon Jan 09 19:27:06 +0000 2012,@AnnikaEddens909 Some people are more comfortable using products with less chemicals or that haven't hurt animals in the process. Use them

156455622810939400,Mon Jan 09 19:21:41 +0000 2012,@patri_xDD Como me alegro! ;)
156455476438122500,Mon Jan 09 19:21:07 +0000 2012,@Afrouz70 @iamEmmaWilde like Viviscal are great for all-over healthy hair. To make lash "appear" thicker some people like the masc. w fiber
156454828401373200,Mon Jan 09 19:18:32 +0000 2012,@Afrouz70 @iamEmmaWilde There's a few products that make lashes grow longer (Latisse, Revitalash etc..) but not really thicker. Hair vitamin
156454198580490240,Mon Jan 09 19:16:02 +0000 2012,@celinesmiles_ I use that Dior balm on Kate W. everyday. It is really nice ;)
156454053579210750,Mon Jan 09 19:15:27 +0000 2012,@celinesmiles_ Isn't it great? I'm so happy you liked it!
156453925812314100,Mon Jan 09 19:14:57 +0000 2012,@Pitchousse Aww thank you for sharing this. She's the best, isn't she? I love her! ;)
156453677895401470,Mon Jan 09 19:13:58 +0000 2012,@kaddaki I always try the skin care I want to use on my clients first. I like to have an educated opinion :)
156453455471452160,Mon Jan 09 19:13:05 +0000 2012,@kaddaki anywhere from 20 mins to an hour. It depends on the job ;)
156453229637550080,Mon Jan 09 19:12:11 +0000 2012,@MelissaParkerx Regardless of ur brow color, try an "ash blonde" pencil. It will help define & thicken ur brows without making them dark.

154961806522204160,Thu Jan 05 16:25:48 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel as you know I'm a huge fan of emu oil (over damp skin) because of its anti-inflammatory qualities. Try just a few drops!
154707756681670660,Wed Jan 04 23:36:18 +0000 2012,@Sasha_My_Jewel it's not a good idea to apply makeup to skin that isn't "happy". Have you tried a soothing cream? Murad makes a good one!
154654968475955200,Wed Jan 04 20:06:32 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto I understand. Two different uses for these two products. Pat the cream over your makeup for a fresh look. No powder.
154654171059077120,Wed Jan 04 20:03:22 +0000 2012,@LillyMaldonado2 try to avoid petroleum-based products. They end up drying your lips more :(

154641296043151360,Wed Jan 04 19:12:12 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto creamy (moisturizing) concealer: tap with fingers or use a gentle synthetic brush :)
154640963631988740,Wed Jan 04 19:10:53 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto yes. Primer after your moisturizer is completely absorbed. I love secret finish powder over concealer. Try not to over powder :)
154628644365549570,Wed Jan 04 18:21:57 +0000 2012,Someone recently asked about a GREAT sheer foundation & I keep forgetting to mention 1 of my faves: MAKEUP FOR EVER! http://t.co/866K3f4F

154373105517723650,Wed Jan 04 01:26:31 +0000 2012,@TheAmyBrenneman WHAT?!?! You didn't exfoliate your lips?!?! Just wait till I get my hands on you! LOL ;-)
154365523952545800,Wed Jan 04 00:56:23 +0000 2012,@brandihaugen Are you using a synthetic foundation brush? Never used Smashbox but I do love the Armani Silk Foundations and Chanel :)
154305983655579650,Tue Jan 03 20:59:48 +0000 2012,@Angelina_Ber that's beautiful!! Nice work! ;)
154281951585517570,Tue Jan 03 19:24:18 +0000 2012,@MarieBiesmans exfoliate three times a week and then use a few drops of jojoba oil or emu oil after showering and before your skin care :)
154275887246876670,Tue Jan 03 19:00:12 +0000 2012,@Manu_Mpp thank you!
154275887204941820,Tue Jan 03 19:00:12 +0000 2012,@lipsmacker2 thanks so much!
154274819725197300,Tue Jan 03 18:55:58 +0000 2012,Then I finished it with a strong hot pink lip and two coats of mascara. It was beautiful! And it took 5 minutes! http://t.co/xkFZCwHH
154274366434181120,Tue Jan 03 18:54:10 +0000 2012,I recently did a no-foundation makeup using Nars "Coppacabana" stick as an all over highlighter (cheeks, lids, nose):) http://t.co/ZmYo6Kbe
154246614943416320,Tue Jan 03 17:03:53 +0000 2012,@come_il_mare @sabs_85 yes, it's best to trust a cosmetic company that has done the research :) http://t.co/1LQFRFlL
154246311825248260,Tue Jan 03 17:02:41 +0000 2012,@Sabs_85 haha! You won't be able to miss it. It's when Pete looks like Addison and Amelia looks like Cooper ;)
154236538522308600,Tue Jan 03 16:23:51 +0000 2012,Last year, we finished by talking about exfoliating lips, remember? How many of you actually tried it?
154236265766719500,Tue Jan 03 16:22:45 +0000 2012,@ruthkjsto sure!

146674595175464960,Tue Dec 13 19:35:23 +0000 2011,Holy s**t!! I just applied the last makeup of 2011!!! Woohoo!!! Dear Vacation, thanks for your patience, I am now ready. Take me! :-)
146670763758452740,Tue Dec 13 19:20:10 +0000 2011,@kchadha19 I use my Clarisonic brush in the shower. I use it also over my lips. Try using a toothbrush gently :) http://t.co/vxfv1cUN
146669846439002100,Tue Dec 13 19:16:31 +0000 2011,I think MAC still makes this one. Half exfoliator, half delicious lip treatment :) http://t.co/smDKoX4k
146666802456432640,Tue Dec 13 19:04:25 +0000 2011,This is a nice lip exfoliator but you can find many other brands that make it. Start exfoliating your lips!!! ;-) http://t.co/2oeksAPt
146666163529728000,Tue Dec 13 19:01:52 +0000 2011,There's nothing worse than trying to apply lipstick or gloss over chapped and dehydrated lips. Keep your lips exfoliated!

146352343091392500,Mon Dec 12 22:14:52 +0000 2011,@KjanelleC This palette's called (I think) Spiced Chocolate. I can confirm later :)

146351889615831040,Mon Dec 12 22:13:04 +0000 2011,@ElizabethHamil3 I you pick a pimple, it's more likely to leave redness. Try drying it out or let a facialist help you. Don't pick! ;)
146351539085258750,Mon Dec 12 22:11:40 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto I'd say hundreds but yes, I have multiples :)
146351221710655500,Mon Dec 12 22:10:24 +0000 2011,@brandihaugen I have to say that I could never buy makeup brushes on line. I HAVE to touch then before I know which ones are good.
146314872974614530,Mon Dec 12 19:45:59 +0000 2011,@KjanelleC here's my favorite solution for that. Laura Mercier eye primer. Smooth over lids and blend well b4 shadow:) http://t.co/jyfbnBJO

146282245479600130,Mon Dec 12 17:36:19 +0000 2011,@MelissaParkerx different brands make good ones. Try Laura Mercier, Clarins, Mac :)
146282003426320400,Mon Dec 12 17:35:22 +0000 2011,@kittenchopsUK Sure do. Either 1999 or 2000. Set of "The Mind Of The Married Man". She was blonde for one day. Then she became a redhead ;)

145192794422652930,Fri Dec 09 17:27:14 +0000 2011,@Char_Coop4eva Did I already tell you to check Exuviance for pale foundations and the Laura Mercier tinted moisturizers?
145192493900763140,Fri Dec 09 17:26:02 +0000 2011,@kittenchopsUK no, I haven't.
145176093287129100,Fri Dec 09 16:20:52 +0000 2011,@Char_Coop4eva Ok. Something's going on with your cosmetics. Is your mascara older that three months?
145159123170902000,Fri Dec 09 15:13:26 +0000 2011,@Char_Coop4eva what brand is your mascara?
145156445799854080,Fri Dec 09 15:02:48 +0000 2011,@PrParminder of course :)
145156404683079680,Fri Dec 09 15:02:38 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare that can happen sometimes but it was a beautiful deep purple :)

144988501778239500,Fri Dec 09 03:55:27 +0000 2011,@Phine111 @lexie_renee try it with a lighter pencil and a metallic shadow. It won't make u look like a raccoon ;)

144949935886970880,Fri Dec 09 01:22:12 +0000 2011,@kristinalhannah Why don't you start with Stila convertible colors? They're so easy to use. Start with a light color :)
144949251565297660,Fri Dec 09 01:19:29 +0000 2011,@Lexie_Renee best way 2 make a pencil last is 2 smudge it with eye shadow. It's very easy to do an very flattering. Just blend, blend, blend
144945193022529540,Fri Dec 09 01:03:21 +0000 2011,@KjanelleC Thank you for posting this video. I forgot about those tips ;-)
144944906111168500,Fri Dec 09 01:02:13 +0000 2011,@kristinalhannah More than one texture. More than one color or more than one finish. Try it! ;)
144944733926588400,Fri Dec 09 01:01:32 +0000 2011,@kristinalhannah I love starting with cream blush. Tap with fingers. Then go over with a light blush or bronzer with low shimmer. Love using

144932801265942530,Fri Dec 09 00:14:07 +0000 2011,@mayameeify I agree but being that this is a red carpet event you have to go a bit more glam ;)

144864373230415870,Thu Dec 08 19:42:12 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto Ok. Listen carefully: DON'T TATTOO YOUR EYELINER!!!!!! Instead, try waterproof pencils or eyeliner sealer. Much safer. Pain-free.

144820640568967170,Thu Dec 08 16:48:26 +0000 2011,Check out this beauty video I did makeup for last year for Jafra cosmetics. It was a really fun project! :) http://t.co/bFyfxuuO
144819519163072500,Thu Dec 08 16:43:58 +0000 2011,@MarieBiesmans It's hard to explain when I don't have her in front of me. But the short answer is yes, she can totally wear makeup :)
144819131705860100,Thu Dec 08 16:42:26 +0000 2011,@MarieBiesmans with really small eyes application is key. She can still wear eye makeup, of course, she has to learn what works best for her
144818782337114100,Thu Dec 08 16:41:02 +0000 2011,@carlota_bl Bien!! Buena suerte. Ya me dir√°s que tal :)
144818659016183800,Thu Dec 08 16:40:33 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel No. You can wear mascara on both your top and bottom lashes. Sometimes, for a different look, you can wear it on top only :)
144780236234571780,Thu Dec 08 14:07:52 +0000 2011,@TegsNZ while that body wash sounds great, the amount of jojoba oil in it is probably small. Using straight jojoba on your skin is best :)
144773009473937400,Thu Dec 08 13:39:09 +0000 2011,@TeamStrick Yes. Definitely. But it's best to be able to touch a brush before buying it if at all possible :)
144586276975296500,Thu Dec 08 01:17:09 +0000 2011,@Framboise2010 about ;-)
144581033998823420,Thu Dec 08 00:56:19 +0000 2011,@Framboise2010 ...makes great concealers called " Amazing concealers" ;)
144580863458410500,Thu Dec 08 00:55:38 +0000 2011,@Framboise2010 Cle de peau concealers are really creamy with great coverage. Lanc√¥me Maquicomplete are also really good. Amazing cosmetics..
144575887952719870,Thu Dec 08 00:35:52 +0000 2011,@Framboise2010 love that!! ;-)
144563917325221900,Wed Dec 07 23:48:18 +0000 2011,@TeamStrick Shu Uemura and MAC are my top faves for foundation brushes :)
144558991157104640,Wed Dec 07 23:28:43 +0000 2011,@frouk_je Nice!
144558877906706430,Wed Dec 07 23:28:16 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 No comment.
144558824362229760,Wed Dec 07 23:28:04 +0000 2011,@ricochetmooon NO WAY!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
144558499576299520,Wed Dec 07 23:26:46 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
144558149179936770,Wed Dec 07 23:25:23 +0000 2011,@TimmyDaly I don't suppose you've kept any photos of this, have you? I need to see it. You know...research ;)
144555832678424580,Wed Dec 07 23:16:10 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 nothing vindictive on a bad client. I'm boringly professional when it comes to my job. No juicy gossip :)
144555489940873200,Wed Dec 07 23:14:49 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 I once glued an actress's lips shut by accident. It was f/x makeup for dehydration and used the wrong thing on set!! It was bad! :)
144555043188781060,Wed Dec 07 23:13:02 +0000 2011,@ricochetmooon Oh what the hell! Go ahead a share! ;)
144553225452916740,Wed Dec 07 23:05:49 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto Ouch!
144552618700701700,Wed Dec 07 23:03:24 +0000 2011,Thank you guys for all your hilarious makeup-gone-wrong tweets. You're all really good sports! Xoxo
144551648470118400,Wed Dec 07 22:59:33 +0000 2011,@Katiiepiie a few HOURS?!? Wow! Sorry to hear that but makes for a funny story! ;)
144551388398096400,Wed Dec 07 22:58:31 +0000 2011,@katelyn0303 That's a good one!
144551308790206460,Wed Dec 07 22:58:12 +0000 2011,@brandihaugen OMG! That's beyond awesome!! I saw that once at a bar. It was memorable :-) thank you for sharing. So funny!
144550914227834880,Wed Dec 07 22:56:38 +0000 2011,@oimelchen please do :)
144550857533435900,Wed Dec 07 22:56:24 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 Yes that's makeup and your story, hilarious!! Thx
144550751526596600,Wed Dec 07 22:55:59 +0000 2011,@TegsNZ You have plenty of time to learn. Ask questions. I'll do what I can :)
144550624938307600,Wed Dec 07 22:55:29 +0000 2011,@LillyMaldonado2 listen, I'm proud of you for trying! ;)
144533703438237700,Wed Dec 07 21:48:14 +0000 2011,@Baby_Walshie good night xxx
144530739730452480,Wed Dec 07 21:36:28 +0000 2011,I want to hear from you! Can you share your most embarrassing makeup misstep with me? Don't be shy!!
144530165626712060,Wed Dec 07 21:34:11 +0000 2011,@eeoz Only here doing Kate W while she's back at Grey's. Then back to PP :)
144504042394099700,Wed Dec 07 19:50:23 +0000 2011,@MarieBiesmans Do only one element of gold at a time. Cheeks OR eyes OR lips. That way the makeup doesn't take over your face ;)
144493794006548480,Wed Dec 07 19:09:39 +0000 2011,@oimelchen I'd say try something new. New color. New technique. New look. Something :)
144491541845639170,Wed Dec 07 19:00:42 +0000 2011,Are you planning on shaking up your makeup for the holidays?
144489671743897600,Wed Dec 07 18:53:17 +0000 2011,@sammah101 If you're looking for SERIOUS coverage, Kryolan makes the ultimate pro concealer palette. Dermacolor. http://t.co/a3rrAF1z
144485477469261820,Wed Dec 07 18:36:36 +0000 2011,@Phine111 But if your skin is damp and you only use 2 or 3 drops, it absorbs pretty quickly.
144485262754463740,Wed Dec 07 18:35:45 +0000 2011,@La_Killa Si, es genial!
144483744101838850,Wed Dec 07 18:29:43 +0000 2011,@Mymy72700 I can't promise anything but I'll try :)
144483594327433200,Wed Dec 07 18:29:07 +0000 2011,@Phine111 Oils are great! I love them but if I'm putting makeup on a client right away and don't have time to wait, I'll use moisturizer ;-)
144481431123525630,Wed Dec 07 18:20:32 +0000 2011,@Sabs_85 Where do you think she got all her tips? ;-)
144481274642432000,Wed Dec 07 18:19:54 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto the skin absorbs more moisture when it's damp. Either using toner or right out of the shower.
144480065416208400,Wed Dec 07 18:15:07 +0000 2011,And for the vegan version of that same tip, I use Jojoba oil :) http://t.co/3ZmwupCe
144479905592262660,Wed Dec 07 18:14:29 +0000 2011,My favorite way to prep the skin is with a couple of drops of Emu oil on wet skin. http://t.co/8fkWZ5tr
144479388803670000,Wed Dec 07 18:12:25 +0000 2011,@TeamStrick personally I prefer a foundation brush for foundation and cream blush :)
144432752580759550,Wed Dec 07 15:07:06 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 LOL!!!
144428287228260350,Wed Dec 07 14:49:21 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 Not today. Thank God! Juts the usual drama of a tv drama show :)
144428097800908800,Wed Dec 07 14:48:36 +0000 2011,@La_Killa me acabo de dar cuenta que tienes una foto con Idina. De cuando es esa foto? Ella es genial. La maquill√© para su concierto en LA:)
144427020015775740,Wed Dec 07 14:44:19 +0000 2011,Back at Grey's Anatomy for some more drama! ;)
144426854181388300,Wed Dec 07 14:43:40 +0000 2011,@lipsmacker2 I grew up drawing, sketching and painting. I started putting makeup on my sisters. Eventually in LA I went to Joe Blasco :)
144424936700772350,Wed Dec 07 14:36:02 +0000 2011,@lipsmacker2 no , she doesn't :(
144424030303305730,Wed Dec 07 14:32:26 +0000 2011,@TeamStrick Thanks. Leslie Lightfoot (who works with me) does the lovely KaDee's makeup. I'll pass along your compliment. Thank you :)
144217311845416960,Wed Dec 07 00:51:01 +0000 2011,@kagnire @lalatas Right now, we're shooting Kate's therapy session. She looks gorgeous if I may say so myself ;-)

144190585580945400,Tue Dec 06 23:04:49 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare The important thing for you is to look for a skinny and long mascara brush. Stay away from the big bushy ones. Great tip! ;-)
144176706842935300,Tue Dec 06 22:09:40 +0000 2011,@lipsmacker2 Nice job :-)
144175844108140540,Tue Dec 06 22:06:14 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare well from the drugstore Loreal Voluminous from Sephora Makeup Forever lengthening and from the Dept. Store: Chanel or YSL :-)
144175219614035970,Tue Dec 06 22:03:45 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel @ruthkjsto Are you kidding? Of course! Would I send someone else's eye? Hahaha :-)
144174981675352060,Tue Dec 06 22:02:48 +0000 2011,@lipsmacker2 it's no problem. I speak English and Spanish.

143884606582689800,Tue Dec 06 02:48:58 +0000 2011,@mykemakeupguy so rude of them! ;)
143878527169724420,Tue Dec 06 02:24:48 +0000 2011,Bloody scene. Literally. Not in the mood to handle fake blood today and yet, that's exactly what I'm doing. Somehow blood is not glamourous.
143864653217406980,Tue Dec 06 01:29:40 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto I'm joking, of course ;)
143860586734825470,Tue Dec 06 01:13:31 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto not so good hahaha
143854418666860540,Tue Dec 06 00:49:00 +0000 2011,@LillyMaldonado2 @lexie_renee It might be harder to kick that first cup of coffee. Try it instead when you get a dip of energy in your day:)
143853881875628030,Tue Dec 06 00:46:52 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 Well, I've been up since 4am but I did go to bed at 8:30pm last night ;)
143852715766849540,Tue Dec 06 00:42:15 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto Not bad for a 44 year-old eye, right?? ;-) http://t.co/3U7qx0n3
143849889934213120,Tue Dec 06 00:31:01 +0000 2011,@StevieBBlackman Consider it done. BTW my trailer door is always open to you. Come in for a consult. I'll hook you up :)

143845438653607940,Tue Dec 06 00:13:19 +0000 2011,@lipsmacker2 oh ok. I guess I can look into it :)
143845217181777920,Tue Dec 06 00:12:26 +0000 2011,@LillyMaldonado2 @lexie_renee Good point. I gave up coffee last year (switched to green tea and Yerba Matte) and I have never slept better:)
143844606319144960,Tue Dec 06 00:10:01 +0000 2011,@lipsmacker2 I don't even know what that is!! Hahaha I'm so out of touch!
143843720129818620,Tue Dec 06 00:06:30 +0000 2011,These concealers by Amazing Cosmetics are, well... Amazing! ;-) http://t.co/DRFxYwk6

143795666009849860,Mon Dec 05 20:55:33 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto hahaha!
143794682621730820,Mon Dec 05 20:51:39 +0000 2011,With a texture like mousse, these cream shadows go on and stay on beautifully. I'm obsessed with every color! Chanel!! http://t.co/HVOcda58
143793709635473400,Mon Dec 05 20:47:46 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto It deals with every eye issue: lines, hyper pigmentation, texture etc...I use it every night :-)

143747298172735490,Mon Dec 05 17:43:21 +0000 2011,@kaddaki Shadows & compacts break easily. I'm pretty good about it. I may drop something a couple of times a year. It's sad when they break

143022926583693310,Sat Dec 03 17:44:57 +0000 2011,@kagnire It depends if you're not wearing a lot of makeup during the day, I'd say wear a subtle cream eye shadow or something matte :)
143009872378728450,Sat Dec 03 16:53:05 +0000 2011,I'm really excited to spend my Saturday afternoon face-painting for kids with cancer ;-)

142752853189083140,Fri Dec 02 23:51:47 +0000 2011,@brandihaugen Actually, yes. I believe Makeup Forever makes those pens :)
142752625270591490,Fri Dec 02 23:50:52 +0000 2011,@mykemakeupguy hmm that happens to me with other cleaners but not this one.
142740840777924600,Fri Dec 02 23:04:03 +0000 2011,@brandihaugen I'd want to clean a foundation brush after each use if for no other reason that the bristles would stick together.
142740339940274180,Fri Dec 02 23:02:03 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare Not if you're using a actual cleanser. They're designed to disinfect and dry quickly.
142738687329959940,Fri Dec 02 22:55:30 +0000 2011,Almost every makeup line makes a brush cleaner. My favorite comes from Cinema Secrets in LA :) http://t.co/BoPlKxmq
142738346882498560,Fri Dec 02 22:54:08 +0000 2011,It's SUPER important to keep your makeup brushes clean. They'll perform better, last longer & they won't transfer bacteria onto your makeup!
142737710971490300,Fri Dec 02 22:51:36 +0000 2011,@Jules_Bradshaw You better believe it! But when I HAD to share mascaras in the past, I always use disposable mascara wands and dip only once
142735169659469820,Fri Dec 02 22:41:30 +0000 2011,@KatieOffer You're very welcome :)
142735095483211780,Fri Dec 02 22:41:13 +0000 2011,@_alwayswithyou_ Ok. Well it doesn't sound like it's doing a great job so you might want to invest in a better one. I love Shu Uemura :)
142734784102273020,Fri Dec 02 22:39:59 +0000 2011,How often do you clean your makeup brushes? (Assuming you DO clean them) ;-)
142731589447712770,Fri Dec 02 22:27:17 +0000 2011,@_alwayswithyou_ It does matter. Yes. Definitely. If you have short lashes, a voluminizing mascara isn't the best for u. 4 example.
142730963338797060,Fri Dec 02 22:24:48 +0000 2011,@KatieOffer It's because they're not complimentary colors. They're too similar to be complimentary. It's better to off-set a color :)
142728678848213000,Fri Dec 02 22:15:43 +0000 2011,@_alwayswithyou_ I assume you are using a lash curler. Right? Which one? I suggest a lengthening mascara. Lately I love Makeup Forever :)
142724505851269120,Fri Dec 02 21:59:08 +0000 2011,@_alwayswithyou_ Trial + error, I'm afraid, is the only way. Ask 4 guidance from a local makeup person and don't be afraid to try new things
142722668507054080,Fri Dec 02 21:51:50 +0000 2011,@huxleytucker Ok! I love that. Thank you for sharing. I'll give it a try :)
142715309156073470,Fri Dec 02 21:22:35 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare oh, God. I wouldn't know how to answer that without giving it away so...I'm sorry but you'll see. It's worth the wait ;-)

142713319315353600,Fri Dec 02 21:14:41 +0000 2011,@MiaMarianne That's good to know. I'm not familiar. Thanks for sharing!
142704693091635200,Fri Dec 02 20:40:24 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel Give Makeup Forever Lengthening Mascara (#1) a try. I love the skinny brush and the texture of the mascara seems 2b perfect!
142703217690673150,Fri Dec 02 20:34:33 +0000 2011,@MadeUpGirl323 Yes! MAC put them together and I agree, they're gorgeous. My have is to layer the rust over the plum in a smoky eye. HOT HOT!
142702563211489280,Fri Dec 02 20:31:57 +0000 2011,@bugsbunny87 NO. I'm just saying that's what I like. You are doing just fine, I'm sure!
142702291047301120,Fri Dec 02 20:30:52 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel Isn't that Chanel? I love the water-proof formula. It's great on bottom lashes and in colors (if they still make colors)
142701954005598200,Fri Dec 02 20:29:31 +0000 2011,@MadeUpGirl323 Good question. I'm not sure about the names (i'll have 2 look when I'm back at work) but u can find these colors individually
142701583447236600,Fri Dec 02 20:28:03 +0000 2011,@bugsbunny87 That dark brown you should only use at the lash line to give the rest of the colors more depth. Bronzes + Golds r great 4u 2 ;)
142698512583364600,Fri Dec 02 20:15:51 +0000 2011,@DamienCope Not so much :-) Do you?
142697958419349500,Fri Dec 02 20:13:39 +0000 2011,@bugsbunny87 I just tweeted about these colors. Amazing on green/blue eyes :) http://t.co/33ew5DH4

142692899795120130,Fri Dec 02 19:53:33 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel I like it. I actually love the brush but I find the mascara too wet for my taste. It un-curls the lashes a little bit :-(
142691840527843330,Fri Dec 02 19:49:21 +0000 2011,These colors (by MAC) are some of @katewalsh's favorites. They're beautiful especially on green and blue eyes! :) http://t.co/sqwKW7dB

142688342465724420,Fri Dec 02 19:35:26 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 Actually, I don't! And I realized later, it wasn't last year but this year. I want to say, maybe a Canadian magazine but not sure!

142687725127081980,Fri Dec 02 19:32:59 +0000 2011,I guess @katewalsh already told you that @HAIRBYARLEEN and I are shooting at Gray's Anatomy today. Super Top Secret! Ssshhh...(so fun!)
142687059038056450,Fri Dec 02 19:30:20 +0000 2011,@maureenthirteen Of course!
142686045031510020,Fri Dec 02 19:26:18 +0000 2011,@Jules_Bradshaw Mascara is a breeding ground for bacteria. Sharing it puts you at risk of eye infections :(

142683990397169660,Fri Dec 02 19:18:08 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 then I'd say 4 months. The truth is that once its opened, mascara begins to dry anyway.
142683482085265400,Fri Dec 02 19:16:07 +0000 2011,@ashpotts_ Oh poor baby! ;-)

142682529567227900,Fri Dec 02 19:12:20 +0000 2011,@LeaCFrance Well, I realized my dream the day I understood that I could make a living doing what I love most: Makeup :)
142682201195151360,Fri Dec 02 19:11:02 +0000 2011,@Manu_Mpp ya. El que es mas color vino que morado es el que te recomiendo :)
142682013885939710,Fri Dec 02 19:10:17 +0000 2011,That's right! If you're a daily user of mascara, you should throw it away about every 3 months. And NEVER EVER share with anyone! Gross!! :)
142677958396608510,Fri Dec 02 18:54:10 +0000 2011,If you use mascara every day, do you know how often you should replace it with a new one?
142677699259936770,Fri Dec 02 18:53:08 +0000 2011,@justincasek8 Any particular one? Why do you like it?

142676272655503360,Fri Dec 02 18:47:28 +0000 2011,@kaddaki Good point. I need to try that one again. Thank you!
142676147958857730,Fri Dec 02 18:46:59 +0000 2011,@marvelliciously Ahh I love Chanel too. I was obsessed with their bronze mascara and then they stopped making it :-(
142673687064215550,Fri Dec 02 18:37:12 +0000 2011,@LeaCFrance I was working with Kate on a shoot five years ago and she asked if I'd want to do her new show. I fell in love with cast & crew
142664506596798460,Fri Dec 02 18:00:43 +0000 2011,I'm just curious, what (in your opinion) is the best mascara out there? And why?
142663932111372290,Fri Dec 02 17:58:26 +0000 2011,@pantsinlace Sadly no :-( But I want to learn!

142417971929817090,Fri Dec 02 01:41:05 +0000 2011,@lalatas This is for lashes but they also make one for eyebrows and another for hair :)
142415940112490500,Fri Dec 02 01:33:01 +0000 2011,In case you were wondering... THIS WORKS!!! You just have to be consistent and use nightly but it works! http://t.co/N951Zmrf

142312693985062910,Thu Dec 01 18:42:44 +0000 2011,@brandihaugen yes, that helps. Also lighting the inner corners (either side of bridge of nose) with concealer + using shadow on bottom
142312675626582020,Thu Dec 01 18:42:40 +0000 2011,@brandihaugen on bottom outer corners and extending it out. Also make sure your brows don't come too close together. This opens up ur eyes:)

142015153955799040,Wed Nov 30 23:00:25 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare you're funny :-)
142011913696591870,Wed Nov 30 22:47:33 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel So you can use this brush for many things including blending hard edges or applying shadow :)
142011614902763520,Wed Nov 30 22:46:22 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel hahaha! Not at all! Think of it this way: Long haired brushes deposit less product (aka shadow). Short haired deposits more.
142004215873667070,Wed Nov 30 22:16:58 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel Great shadow brush. I use it to soften hard lines or apply  highlight on the brow bone :-) http://t.co/5aS0ud0q
141982593196367870,Wed Nov 30 20:51:03 +0000 2011,For a touch of a golden glow over the cheeks (or anywhere!), I love using Nars Albatross. Looks white but goes on gold http://t.co/SsNimjEa
141978488386228220,Wed Nov 30 20:34:44 +0000 2011,@kaddaki Sorry, no. No guys for the "before & after" photos. It's just not interested enough :-(
141978031077081090,Wed Nov 30 20:32:55 +0000 2011,@addyette that's perfect ;)
141977482059460600,Wed Nov 30 20:30:44 +0000 2011,@JNB22222 It's actually a MAC pencil called Teddy :)
141894695121993730,Wed Nov 30 15:01:46 +0000 2011,@maureenthirteen This oil free primer by Smashbox is great. Also, Laura Mercier makes a great oil free primer :) http://t.co/rdcEv3lT
141894362647900160,Wed Nov 30 15:00:27 +0000 2011,@maureenthirteen A couple of things I'd suggest: This Clarins instant smooth to smooth pores and lines and... http://t.co/mldTOcp3
141729646411653120,Wed Nov 30 04:05:55 +0000 2011,@addyette It's really pretty on you. What's your foundation. I love that it's sheer enough to see freckles. I LOVE FRECKLES!! ;)
141716431283830780,Wed Nov 30 03:13:24 +0000 2011,@addyette Well done!! Seriously!! Very well done. I really like that lip color. What is it?
141716224076824580,Wed Nov 30 03:12:35 +0000 2011,@addyette YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!! Good for you for doing this! Who else wants to submit their "before" picture?!? :)
141704615958822910,Wed Nov 30 02:26:27 +0000 2011,@Cassiiandra yes! From high end 2 low, check out the following: Chanticalle Future Skin, Clinique Superfit and Maybelline FIT. All are great
141671938476081150,Wed Nov 30 00:16:37 +0000 2011,For a beautiful overall body glow try PRTTY PEAUSHUN. Find your shade and get glowing! ;-) http://t.co/lO3zNsFL
141656402186870780,Tue Nov 29 23:14:52 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 Of course ;)
141645350879498240,Tue Nov 29 22:30:57 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 Just so you know I'm also a HUGE fan of MB facial masks. They are great and very well priced. I'm sure they have one 4 ur needs.
141645350879498240,Tue Nov 29 22:30:57 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 Just so you know I'm also a HUGE fan of MB facial masks. They are great and very well priced. I'm sure they have one 4 ur needs.
141644587470032900,Tue Nov 29 22:27:55 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 I think MB has a store in NYC of you're close ;-)
141643335763894270,Tue Nov 29 22:22:57 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 ok. Try a professional beauty supply store if there's one around you but your best bet will be Mario Badescu's website :)
141642305311477760,Tue Nov 29 22:18:51 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 what was the product again?
141619255694213120,Tue Nov 29 20:47:16 +0000 2011,@frouk_je With this Kevyn Aucoin Sculping Powder and a small, soft, angle brush apply softly to contour your nose. http://t.co/ZunVX5eu
141610178129833980,Tue Nov 29 20:11:12 +0000 2011,@PrParminder India. But it'll have to wait :(
141609517703118850,Tue Nov 29 20:08:34 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 ;-) good luck!
141608326361387000,Tue Nov 29 20:03:50 +0000 2011,@PrParminder I was supposed to go next year but as of now, my work trip has been indefinitely postponed :-(
141607972005625860,Tue Nov 29 20:02:26 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel Yes. Sometimes we'll throw on a few lashes :-)
141606923832270850,Tue Nov 29 19:58:16 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel @come_il_mare The individual ones give you more freedom. Use as many as you want or need and only where you want them :)
141606594864611330,Tue Nov 29 19:56:57 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare @sasha_my_jewel absolutely. You can also pull the off (provided you're very gentle and careful)
141606338957553660,Tue Nov 29 19:55:56 +0000 2011,@oimelchen Yes. Squeeze a little glue onto the back of your hand and using tweezers dip the "root" of the false lash onto the glue :)
141605887793053700,Tue Nov 29 19:54:09 +0000 2011,Duo adhesive is the safest way to apply those false lashes. It dries clear and peels off at the end of the night ;) http://t.co/CBPfBvND
141605480844902400,Tue Nov 29 19:52:32 +0000 2011,@Phine111 Why not try it? The worst that can happen is that u don't like it but what if you do? :) It could be a fun trick for a special day
141604986579718140,Tue Nov 29 19:50:34 +0000 2011,@PrParminder Oh, I see! Sorry. Yes, those eye makeups are inspiring. I do a version of those sometimes for red-carpet events :)
141604134267785220,Tue Nov 29 19:47:11 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel @come_il_mare once u're used to it, it takes only a few minutes. Curl lashes first. Dip false-lash "root" onto glue & apply
141603524344680450,Tue Nov 29 19:44:45 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 who knows? Anything is possible! I'll keep u posted ;)
141603290541604860,Tue Nov 29 19:43:50 +0000 2011,@Phine111 This glue is totally safe and it peels right off when dry. Dip the "root" of the lash and place on your own http://t.co/h6cUOq21
141602774176641020,Tue Nov 29 19:41:47 +0000 2011,@oimelchen This glue is totally safe and it peels right off when dry. Dip the "root" of the lash and place on your own http://t.co/fJlmN0nC
141600495608401920,Tue Nov 29 19:32:43 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 I understand. You should try have someone put them on for you. A friend that's good with makeup. It's fun!
141600251021770750,Tue Nov 29 19:31:45 +0000 2011,@come_il_mare Unless you're allergic to latex ( and gorgeous lashes ;)) yes! ;)
141598068163354620,Tue Nov 29 19:23:05 +0000 2011,How intimidated (or not) are you by "individual" lashes? Are you a regular user? If not, what's stopping you? http://t.co/t1YQswlX
141597437025456130,Tue Nov 29 19:20:34 +0000 2011,@JNB22222 You're awesome. Thanks for that! It's a beautiful color. I will pass it on to Leslie who does KaDee's makeup. Thanks again :)
141596568192159740,Tue Nov 29 19:17:07 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel awesome!!! ;-)
141572754871812100,Tue Nov 29 17:42:29 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel Great! Let me know what you get and if you like it! ;)
141568021452947460,Tue Nov 29 17:23:41 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto hahaha!! That's so sweet! :)
141566537604673540,Tue Nov 29 17:17:47 +0000 2011,@socccer247 I run the makeup dept and oversee everyone's makeup but personally do Kate's and Amy's :)
141564295665295360,Tue Nov 29 17:08:52 +0000 2011,@kagnire Yes :)
141557240711753730,Tue Nov 29 16:40:50 +0000 2011,@kagnire on that particular episode @katewalsh wore NO makeup whatsoever so it was really easy for me LOL :)
141541026849488900,Tue Nov 29 15:36:25 +0000 2011,Shiseido cream eyeshadows are really amazing. Providing a beautiful wash of color that does NOT crease. Love the gold! http://t.co/5RX5557U
141518258896510980,Tue Nov 29 14:05:56 +0000 2011,@ruthkjsto sometimes when she's not too busy and I get lucky ;-)
141386957283528700,Tue Nov 29 05:24:12 +0000 2011,@ashpotts_ You should b ok but if u want to try something else, I recommend the Koh Gen Do Spa Water. It works great! http://t.co/0Nd5xrp2
141385552002949120,Tue Nov 29 05:18:37 +0000 2011,@mama__miaa No, the makeup F/X department designed and applied the prosthetics for KaDee's battered makeup. Wasn't it amazing?
141385066709397500,Tue Nov 29 05:16:41 +0000 2011,@socccer247 You're very kind. Thank you so much :)
141384851134758910,Tue Nov 29 05:15:49 +0000 2011,@ashpotts_ Old trick that really works HOWEVER there are better things to put on your skin than petroleum-based products (like Vaseline).
141363028527546370,Tue Nov 29 03:49:07 +0000 2011,@socccer247 let me refer you to @HAIRBYARLEEN She's the one who does hair. I only do makeup. Arleen is AWSOME!!! Good luck! ;)
141309233722441730,Tue Nov 29 00:15:21 +0000 2011,@KaDeeStrick Dr. King has nothing on you, girl! You're amazing! Thanks again for agreeing to do the photos! Xoxo
141308993061662720,Tue Nov 29 00:14:24 +0000 2011,@lalatas try an oil-free foundation primer like Smashbox. Smooth over your face under makeup or tinted moisturizer :) http://t.co/Wj1SLJEN
141299531026407420,Mon Nov 28 23:36:48 +0000 2011,@EmmaNajade yes, please. Good luck!
141299338738532350,Mon Nov 28 23:36:02 +0000 2011,@PrParminder I'm not sure I understand this question. I'm sorry :(
141299155837517820,Mon Nov 28 23:35:18 +0000 2011,@lalatas That's the whole point ;-) Nothing but makeup. It's better this way ;)
141280269951975420,Mon Nov 28 22:20:15 +0000 2011,@Anais_lacroix it's my pleasure :)
141279986303778820,Mon Nov 28 22:19:08 +0000 2011,@KjanelleC Awww thanks so much :)
141275615776092160,Mon Nov 28 22:01:46 +0000 2011,@KjanelleC it should but if not (and you like minerals) try this liquid mineral makeup over the foundation primer. http://t.co/jJN37Peu
141275115164925950,Mon Nov 28 21:59:46 +0000 2011,@EmmaNajade This way you will create a golden smokey eye that's perfect for your coloring. Also a simple cat-eye with black gel liner :-)
141274719923085310,Mon Nov 28 21:58:13 +0000 2011,@EmmaNajade Try 2 rim ur eyes all around with this copper brown pencil by Laura Mercier & "smoking" gold shadow on top http://t.co/4f31SpsL
141257262575517700,Mon Nov 28 20:48:50 +0000 2011,@La_Killa La verdad es que no tengo ni idea!! Lo siento mucho. Solo se de escuelas en EEUU :( Un saludo muy fuerte a C√°diz!! :)

141253700273455100,Mon Nov 28 20:34:41 +0000 2011,@tiburito85 I meant "electric" colors as in "electric blue" etc... ;-)
141253361923141630,Mon Nov 28 20:33:21 +0000 2011,@ChristineC210 Here's my new favorite shimmery body lotion. You'll love this! On its own or mixed into body makeup :) http://t.co/kWirj9L8
141252959169286140,Mon Nov 28 20:31:45 +0000 2011,@ChristineC210 Yes! This is my absolute favorite self tanner for face AND body. It's great! http://t.co/E5CkhTiI

141250926752186370,Mon Nov 28 20:23:39 +0000 2011,@candygal26 I'm sorry. They're not on Twitter :(
141250659327557630,Mon Nov 28 20:22:36 +0000 2011,@MarieBiesmans No. It's very safe 2 line the inside. Try different colors and try lining from corner 2 corner. Don't do shadow on the bottom
141244823599460350,Mon Nov 28 19:59:24 +0000 2011,@candygal26 No. My very talented team of artists (Michelle Keck and Amy Taylor) take care of Caterina's makeup :)
141240753593651200,Mon Nov 28 19:43:14 +0000 2011,Shakeup your eye makeup by lining the inside of your eyes w/ a bright, electric pencil like these by Makeup Forever :) http://t.co/EieYTTFR
141237971444703230,Mon Nov 28 19:32:11 +0000 2011,@MarieBiesmans Have you tried a cat-eye to elongate the shape of your eye? Also, lining the inside of your eye helps counteract roundness :)
141234234886066180,Mon Nov 28 19:17:20 +0000 2011,@candygal26 Nice work! ;-)
141229173934010370,Mon Nov 28 18:57:13 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 do it! ;-)
141226609331019780,Mon Nov 28 18:47:02 +0000 2011,@JNB22222 it's a very sheer pinky shimmer. Something close might be Nars "orgasm". http://t.co/rcPt1u0i
141223573825126400,Mon Nov 28 18:34:58 +0000 2011,@JNB22222 that's too bad. Let me see if I can find you something comparable.

141189942817718270,Mon Nov 28 16:21:20 +0000 2011,These colors by MAC create a perfect eye for the fall. Playing with matte and shimmery shadows creates depth :) http://t.co/C3KTX5eM
141185426508615680,Mon Nov 28 16:03:23 +0000 2011,@pablitaar Your green eyes will look amazing in burgundy and plums and reddish browns (rust) and bronzes and golds and of course, black ;-)

141162609977196540,Mon Nov 28 14:32:43 +0000 2011,@KjanelleC R U using a foundation primer? Like Laura Mercier or Smashbox? It helps soften pores and fine lines and make your foundation last

139125248980303870,Tue Nov 22 23:36:58 +0000 2011,@CaroleNicoleM White can look to harsh. Try finding a light pink or flesh color pencil to do the same trick. It can brighten your eyes :)
139121220149973000,Tue Nov 22 23:20:58 +0000 2011,@bugsbunny87 There's SO much more than just makeup that goes into making someone look good: Hair, wardrobe, lighting etc... Good question :)

138714588895129600,Mon Nov 21 20:25:09 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel You're welcome. When using this brush remember to apply mascara to the root of the lash that's visible when your eyes close.

138680152279367680,Mon Nov 21 18:08:19 +0000 2011,@JanMcLaughlin in my opinion a synthetic foundation brush (not 2 large) works best it can give a sheer "airbrush" look http://t.co/7is7t6SO

138612210321735680,Mon Nov 21 13:38:20 +0000 2011,@Jen_Wilcox Pencil can be 2 much 4 sure. Try an eyebrow powder in a light ashy blonde & apply it in small hair-like strokes with short brush

137646430725734400,Fri Nov 18 21:40:41 +0000 2011,@CaroleNicoleM Tough decision but YSL Golden Gloss #7 looks beautiful by itself or on top of ANY color on EVERYONE! :) http://t.co/R5kFuB2Q

137613890971385860,Fri Nov 18 19:31:23 +0000 2011,@Sasha_My_Jewel What do you like about these products?
137613638386188290,Fri Nov 18 19:30:23 +0000 2011,It's not always beauty makeups in my world. Sometimes I have to turn a lovely girl into a heroin addict like this one;) http://t.co/fLjiaAuE
137613031533330430,Fri Nov 18 19:27:58 +0000 2011,@LeaCFrance of course!
137597035779080200,Fri Nov 18 18:24:24 +0000 2011,@frouk_je This took about 30 minutes because I had to change the color of her skin to this pale translucent color. Every bit of skin shown;)
137593579492216830,Fri Nov 18 18:10:41 +0000 2011,I'm always stocked up with Comodynes: The greatest makeup remover towelettes! http://t.co/dIkfc3iy
137580180733575170,Fri Nov 18 17:17:25 +0000 2011,Thank you all for the kind tweets! I am incredibly lucky to have the best makeup team in the world and work with the best group of actors!
137576966978142200,Fri Nov 18 17:04:39 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 It takes longer to make her look bad. Of course!
137576501926301700,Fri Nov 18 17:02:48 +0000 2011,@paradiddle388 Yeah, poor thing. She didn't look so good ;)
137575958508085250,Fri Nov 18 17:00:39 +0000 2011,@Manu_Mpp I will! Thank you!
137556839482130430,Fri Nov 18 15:44:40 +0000 2011,@Manu_Mpp My uber talented assistant Michelle Keck did @caterinatweets 's makeup. Trust me, it was really hard to make her look bad ;)
137554971695644670,Fri Nov 18 15:37:15 +0000 2011,So?? How did you all enjoy last night's special episode of Private Practice? Wasn't everyone amazing? :)
137554405422673920,Fri Nov 18 15:35:00 +0000 2011,@8Anna22 I don't watch Cougar Town but I know Busy. We used to work together on a show called "Love Inc" She's an amazing girl :)
137554104519110660,Fri Nov 18 15:33:48 +0000 2011,@loudandfearless We made her pale and broke up her skin with different colors. Used pencils for darkness around eyes. Added sweat and tears
137553048980557820,Fri Nov 18 15:29:37 +0000 2011,@ElizabethHamil3 While I firmly believe that poor diet greatly affects the skin. Acne's bacterial and I don't believe chocolate can cause it
137388115424849920,Fri Nov 18 04:34:13 +0000 2011,@Cassiiandra Sounds great! Keep up the good work. I wish you the best. If makeup is your passion, you have to GO FOR IT! Stop at nothing! :)
