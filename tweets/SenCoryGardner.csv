632238118628929500,Fri Aug 14 17:11:28 +0000 2015,The fundamental issue of Iran Deal: Far too reliant on "compliance" of a terror-funding, murderous regime with American blood on its hands.
632237608748326900,Fri Aug 14 17:09:26 +0000 2015,Iran can "comply" with nuclear deal, violate arms embargo repeatedly, and yet embargo &amp; sanctions lifted over time. http://t.co/U3KU3C7APo
632236998296772600,Fri Aug 14 17:07:01 +0000 2015,Iranian actions highly concerning. As is Administration's response: Sec. Kerry says arms embargo violations do not cause sanction snapbacks.
632236089026199600,Fri Aug 14 17:03:24 +0000 2015,Theoretically, agreement prevents Iranian ballistic missile tests. Iran claims this isn't binding. They go forward. http://t.co/gO1mcrs2sz
632235768954646500,Fri Aug 14 17:02:08 +0000 2015,Soleimani's travel not sole issue. Iranian media reports the regime will conduct ballistic missile tests this year. http://t.co/gO1mcrs2sz

629372098234982400,Thu Aug 06 19:22:56 +0000 2015,Right to keep and bear arms is cherished by millions of Americans. Depriving military recruiters of that right is totally counterproductive.
629371760304066600,Thu Aug 06 19:21:35 +0000 2015,A sidearm ban does nothing to keep military recruiters safe, and instead disarms the very people best qualified to help avert a tragedy.
