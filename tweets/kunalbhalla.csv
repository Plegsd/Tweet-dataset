123075982549725180,Sun Oct 09 16:42:55 +0000 2011,@natansh From what I've seen till now, doing AI might cover more advanced stuff than ML: AI also has exams, et al.

122234165767839740,Fri Oct 07 08:57:50 +0000 2011,@BoweFrankema I pretty much fail badly at that. The best way would probably be a showcase, and then the code behind it--but I can't say ;).

120437569837219840,Sun Oct 02 09:58:48 +0000 2011,Pushed #PressTest 0.2 to the WP.org repos. http://t.co/qlEGxoIl
120412215928041470,Sun Oct 02 08:18:04 +0000 2011,Added class mocking as well. Just about ready for the next alpha release of PressTest :).
120384740841881600,Sun Oct 02 06:28:53 +0000 2011,And now I can modify function behaviour by mocking in #PressTest. It's taken quite a bit of effort!
120356586567909380,Sun Oct 02 04:37:01 +0000 2011,Tip: Make the vertical split in gVim less obtrusive by using the command: `hi VertSplit guibg=bg guifg=fg` #vim

119906756058025980,Fri Sep 30 22:49:35 +0000 2011,One last test to pass and I'm finally done with the parser for PressTest. Then it's on to the mocker. http://t.co/7rHncsaA
119898556722192380,Fri Sep 30 22:16:58 +0000 2011,Using the 3575 line query.php from WordPress as a gold standard: if the parser doesn't break on _that_ -- it probably works ;).
119898208347500540,Fri Sep 30 22:15:35 +0000 2011,Just resolved a rather strange bug that messed up the parser when a function and a class method had the same name.

119619128121229310,Fri Sep 30 03:46:37 +0000 2011,That was weird: I seem to have found an error in how reflection captures doc blocks. Unless I didn't understand the original purpose.
119604227692703740,Fri Sep 30 02:47:24 +0000 2011,And I seem to have finished the first version of the parser! :D. Just need to write a few more simple, deep tests to ensure correctness.
119531570821476350,Thu Sep 29 21:58:41 +0000 2011,Do WordPress/BuddyPress use custom interfaces anywhere? Any ideas? #lazyweb
119530756199563260,Thu Sep 29 21:55:27 +0000 2011,So managed to parse functions, classes, methods properly so far. Need to test properties -- and then finally, overall files.

25116921843,Tue Sep 21 13:12:33 +0000 2010,@boonebgorges I don't think onload works with the &lt;a&gt; tag. Atleast, not for me. Still, there's so much that can be done!
25114826710,Tue Sep 21 12:46:31 +0000 2010,So reluctant to leave this. Taking laptop to pre-placement talk to try out more stuff ;).

25114404839,Tue Sep 21 12:41:33 +0000 2010,@sidin Not exactly a hack. Stupidity in their parser I think -- I can't believe they don't escape quotes in strings.

2333969170,Thu Jun 25 22:41:02 +0000 2009,Nothing better than a game of pool to refresh you for more coding.
2333963589,Thu Jun 25 22:40:46 +0000 2009,@twishmay: I paid for one red bull...  but am guessing it was worth it.
2333363936,Thu Jun 25 22:13:16 +0000 2009,And my second Red bull tonight.SO that makes it an espresso +2 redbulls. I wonder how much caffeine I can take in without riding in clouds?
2331019958,Thu Jun 25 19:41:49 +0000 2009,Greate; so there are those who are still awake. @twishmay you tweet from your cell?

2324296090,Thu Jun 25 09:48:03 +0000 2009,Having an espresso. Without sugar. Very very very bitter. But it keeps me awake and hacking.

2266433697,Sun Jun 21 15:30:07 +0000 2009,@twishmay Compared to Drupal _and_ Wordpress, it definitely is.
2264653671,Sun Jun 21 11:32:38 +0000 2009,A large glass of ice coffee, a broadband connection and great ambiance. Any better way to complete a website?
2264133779,Sun Jun 21 09:53:42 +0000 2009,(Still) Working on the EDC theme. Hope to have it finished today, spl as I've moved FAR FAR AWAY from Joomla and on to Drupal.

2242512769,Fri Jun 19 19:17:03 +0000 2009,@twishmay oops... didn't remember that. Preparation wise I would suggest you try the sample problems they give (somewhere on the net).
2242487646,Fri Jun 19 19:15:08 +0000 2009,#inaperfectworld we would zip to the moon on Monday, tour a black hole on Wendesday, and find the question for 42 on Saturday. Sun - relax.
2242452027,Fri Jun 19 19:12:27 +0000 2009,@twishmay Cool... did you take part last year? I just managed to get thru the first round. Registering again.
2242426405,Fri Jun 19 19:10:32 +0000 2009,preparing for my presentation on monday. Made a cool effect using flickr phots :D
2237512328,Fri Jun 19 12:55:33 +0000 2009,Thanks to my laziness while coding up my site, it now looks like a glorified twitter stream rather than a blog. Need to do some work, fast.
2236455365,Fri Jun 19 10:45:07 +0000 2009,@EvertonBlair nice blog design. Really liked the ad concept... hover to expand.

2207972150,Wed Jun 17 15:37:08 +0000 2009,Feeling tired. and bored. Homeward bound.
2205653082,Wed Jun 17 12:11:07 +0000 2009,RT @akash099IIT Delhi again at top !!! http://bit.ly/JoMTW
2205631924,Wed Jun 17 12:08:43 +0000 2009,and now... better comparison required.
2205267767,Wed Jun 17 11:21:33 +0000 2009,Troubleshooting time. First off, page fetcher.
2191532118,Tue Jun 16 12:28:20 +0000 2009,@twishmay: My first project which was basically a site can now be set up by a 1 line command on any computer.Including installing a php ext.
2191484965,Tue Jun 16 12:22:26 +0000 2009,Never imagined that packaging a site was possible. Or that it was that painful.
2189022611,Tue Jun 16 06:04:09 +0000 2009,And done. Yahoo!
2180262443,Mon Jun 15 17:13:48 +0000 2009,And the office day ends. Homeward bound.
2178055196,Mon Jun 15 14:07:37 +0000 2009,@twishmay We could have played pool in office :P
2177744978,Mon Jun 15 13:37:55 +0000 2009,@Twishmay Couldn't you have detoured through Blr this time instead of Delhi?
2175919369,Mon Jun 15 09:22:55 +0000 2009,And finally. The php extension is completed. Moving on to FE.
2174823037,Mon Jun 15 06:23:57 +0000 2009,Finally, my first php extension is working. Not complete yet, but working :D
2168013042,Sun Jun 14 19:11:45 +0000 2009,@prototypepro That's true, but if I was going in solely for a blog without too many extra features, I would prefer WP. ( &gt; Drupal &gt;&gt; Joomla)
2166963248,Sun Jun 14 17:27:14 +0000 2009,@twishmay I occasionally consider formatting and reinstalling (MIB, anyone?) Defragging isn't that useful. Spl on linux oriented people :P.
2166949318,Sun Jun 14 17:25:47 +0000 2009,@prototypepro Hey, drupal themes are much easier to code than Joomla. Finding the right docs for Joomla is much more painful.
2166927286,Sun Jun 14 17:23:33 +0000 2009,@twishmay Such a short party? And try xkcd, sinfest(.net), brightly wound, pearls before swine. If you haven't, that is.
2164718843,Sun Jun 14 12:50:25 +0000 2009,@anshuman100 I really really wish I could. I would rather not comment on available docs; missing drupal/wp seriously.
2164587565,Sun Jun 14 12:26:48 +0000 2009,@twishmay Try reading stuff on Ajaxian if you haven't. It gives pretty cool tech news.
2164264564,Sun Jun 14 11:23:14 +0000 2009,@Twishmay : Feeling the same way. There's nothing more depressing than seeing 0 new items in the feed. (When you're completely bored, i.e.)
2163379793,Sun Jun 14 08:19:38 +0000 2009,Weisure time. :(. Feeling bored. Oh, and this is definitely the last time I use Joomla!
2154833985,Sat Jun 13 16:04:33 +0000 2009,And another nightout tonight. Tweeting alongside.
2152775570,Sat Jun 13 11:16:39 +0000 2009,Ubuntu 9.04. Boot time? 22 seconds! (lappy formatted, OS's reinstalled. Everything else? TODO)

2119548358,Thu Jun 11 17:30:49 +0000 2009,@twishmay TBH, I thought it already _was_ a word; considering how long it's been around for now. Web 2.0 this, that, blah blah blah
2119539135,Thu Jun 11 17:30:05 +0000 2009,@lagnajeetdas Hi... so you've started twittering too?

2110543081,Thu Jun 11 00:26:48 +0000 2009,And now, implemented server side pagination. Wondering whether to keep working or to have a look at Simba ( = dorm @Y)
2109746318,Wed Jun 10 23:11:15 +0000 2009,And so today, I played pool at 3.00 am. Cool!
2108496114,Wed Jun 10 21:18:49 +0000 2009,Finished my first syntax highlighter. Moving on to server side pagination.
2106696967,Wed Jun 10 18:45:06 +0000 2009,as with a previous nightout for coding, I shall keep tweeting away tonite
2105266531,Wed Jun 10 16:42:13 +0000 2009,And staying late(r) in office today... Not that useful though
2067368225,Sun Jun 07 19:13:16 +0000 2009,Late night is the best time for good (and partially insane) ideas!
2066864780,Sun Jun 07 18:18:49 +0000 2009,Finished reading Cosmos today. Amazing book. Awe-inspiring. And considering that I read Nightfall yesterday, even more so.
