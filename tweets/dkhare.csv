714046731717972000,Sun Mar 27 11:09:41 +0000 2016,@roshandsilva We wd love for Whatsapp to be opened up as a platform (like WeChat). Explosive potential. In the meantime, we hv bot frenzy.
714044735384473600,Sun Mar 27 11:01:45 +0000 2016,.@roshandsilva neither Skype nor Whatsapp are platforms yet (as I would define platforms - https://t.co/gYqafM5CID)
714035259633864700,Sun Mar 27 10:24:06 +0000 2016,Perhaps, as (and once) mobile computing is widely adopted in consumer &amp; enterprise, we will also see fast new platforms adopted in India
714034340351447000,Sun Mar 27 10:20:27 +0000 2016,@roshandsilva Compare when those platforms mainstreamed in the US and when they resulted in value creating companies on top of them in India
714033713751793700,Sun Mar 27 10:17:58 +0000 2016,@a4akshay Love the idea of globally-innovative platforms for India created in India, rather than borrowed from abroad.
714033434922881000,Sun Mar 27 10:16:51 +0000 2016,@KrAbhinavGupta Also, time and effort is a necessary but not sufficient condition to create valuable companies
714032984706252800,Sun Mar 27 10:15:04 +0000 2016,@KrAbhinavGupta True and what I'm saying is that large or near-term markets for this are absent in India.
714032602579996700,Sun Mar 27 10:13:33 +0000 2016,IMO, micropayments are long past their due date in India. Perhaps we will get them thru wallets/IMPS rather than carrier billing on Android
714032137549131800,Sun Mar 27 10:11:42 +0000 2016,@aparanjape Launched 2010, however not a platform (yet).
714030701880811500,Sun Mar 27 10:06:00 +0000 2016,@KrAbhinavGupta Perhaps investors (and many founders) prefer large near-term or current markets?
714027748562329600,Sun Mar 27 09:54:15 +0000 2016,My initial view: over-excitement/hype in India hits way too early, runs into hard times and then (perhaps) emerges 3-5 years later
