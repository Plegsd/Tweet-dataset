511979271758176260,Tue Sep 16 20:45:45 +0000 2014,Amy Poehler can do anything. Not only is she drop dead funny, she's charming, sweet, warm and beautiful. Especially as a bride.
511978304471957500,Tue Sep 16 20:41:54 +0000 2014,That sealed the deal for me. My love for her is now eternal. Duke, however, is seriously engaged with many of @prattprattpratt 's dilemmas.
511977613762371600,Tue Sep 16 20:39:09 +0000 2014,My 13 year old son Duke and I have now seen three years of Parks and Rec episodes in four months. Last night we saw Amy get married.
