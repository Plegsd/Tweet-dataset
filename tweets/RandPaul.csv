874636431045660700,Tue Jun 13 14:35:49 +0000 2017,Today we discuss issues of war and peace. https://t.co/ZScXseQEum
874636396010582000,Tue Jun 13 14:35:41 +0000 2017,We should be attempting to end the aquisition of ballistic missiles from both Iran and Saudi Arabia not fueling an arms race.
874635952580423700,Tue Jun 13 14:33:55 +0000 2017,Even @HillaryClinton when she is speaking honestly in emails, noted the Saudis have supported terrorism. Why would we give them anything?
874635671683682300,Tue Jun 13 14:32:48 +0000 2017,And we are going to give them weapons? I say no.
874635613496016900,Tue Jun 13 14:32:34 +0000 2017,We must stand up and tell Saudi Arabia ENOUGH. They are the biggest exporter of extremism and hatred in the world.

874634735284359200,Tue Jun 13 14:29:05 +0000 2017,Today we will discuss issues of war &amp; peace, which we rarely do. We have been in conflict over 15 years.
874633883957985300,Tue Jun 13 14:25:42 +0000 2017,Saudi Arabia is causing a humanitarian crisis with a war in Yemen. It funds extremism worldwide. Abuses human rights. Stop arming them now.
874633631507107800,Tue Jun 13 14:24:42 +0000 2017,The vote will be close.  It is time we stop the counterproductive and harmful practice of arming a country that promotes extremism
