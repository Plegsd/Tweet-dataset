771490797409673200,Thu Sep 01 23:31:54 +0000 2016,Personally, not signing Witsel now, will prove to be extra incentive for players like Lemina and Sturaro to up their game, with more space.

636549594420244500,Wed Aug 26 14:43:44 +0000 2015,@Jake_brown04 @FabrizioRomano maybe because we already lost Vidal and need to replace him with another player? No way pogba is leaving.

342308053850419200,Wed Jun 05 15:52:54 +0000 2013,@Jamierfc_ @Juventus_FC_fan I would say Hig. is the likely option, and if we sign Tevez its more likely because Higuain would join a friend
