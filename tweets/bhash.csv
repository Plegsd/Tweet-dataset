1026402057,Thu Nov 27 14:20:15 +0000 2008,@pjain I agree, although i meant comparison with 9/11 belittles today's event as it removes focus on the specifics of this attack
1026395064,Thu Nov 27 14:15:15 +0000 2008,@shonali I stopped following IBN the day Rajdeep Sardesai said Indian Navy's sinking of a pirate ship is the best moment since 1971..

1026382582,Thu Nov 27 14:05:27 +0000 2008,@pjain I strongly feel equating mumbai with 9/11 is unimaginative and belittling of the specifics of the event.
1026373503,Thu Nov 27 13:58:48 +0000 2008,@wanderer08 IBN and NDTV have said it won't reprt the NSG movements... and the NSG movement reports seem to have died down
1026368613,Thu Nov 27 13:54:38 +0000 2008,@shonali on the contrary, NDTV anchors seems to be very sombre and even stoic, compared to IBN who're trying to outdo each other #mumbai

1026287321,Thu Nov 27 12:40:59 +0000 2008,I hope we don't fall back on the cliche of commending the "spirit of Mumbai bouncing back" this time and do something more concrete.
