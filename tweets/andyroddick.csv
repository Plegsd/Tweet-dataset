825848666044907500,Sun Jan 29 23:30:40 +0000 2017,@Vtennisfan you're making my point ... Fed/Nadal rested physically and mentally ... Djoker/Murray definitely had some scar tissue from '16
825804483464683500,Sun Jan 29 20:35:06 +0000 2017,@idyllmind it would have made me view the decision through a bit of a different lens for sure.... Impossible to state anything w certainty

825793756859420700,Sun Jan 29 19:52:28 +0000 2017,@AlanAvm1502  you understand that it's a scheduling issue right?They're not gonna pull out of world tour finals most years.Last week of year
825792227423162400,Sun Jan 29 19:46:24 +0000 2017,@hockeysymposium @djgura   Correct
825792083545972700,Sun Jan 29 19:45:49 +0000 2017,@AlanAvm1502   Good.  It looked like he needs it after dominating for 4 plus years. I'd say that validates a month off :)
825791829098512400,Sun Jan 29 19:44:49 +0000 2017,@AlanAvm1502   Which is why they should play world tour finals in October and have all optional 250s afterwards.  Similar to golf schedule
825791590476169200,Sun Jan 29 19:43:52 +0000 2017,@djgura @hockeysymposium  huge bonuses in most contracts for finishing as number 1 ...  not to mention it's huge historically as well
825790910805925900,Sun Jan 29 19:41:10 +0000 2017,@AlanAvm1502  yes and I have no issue as it's a choice and not a requirement .....  not up to us or anyone else to decide
825787834506367000,Sun Jan 29 19:28:56 +0000 2017,@j_haapiainen @wendydshaffer   Wrong. Tournaments pay appearance fees now. Would be their option to continue that practice to get sponsors
825786668577910800,Sun Jan 29 19:24:18 +0000 2017,@absurdities  play tour finals in October... nothing but optional 250s afterwards. Playing late in season would be a choice not requirement
825786326356213800,Sun Jan 29 19:22:57 +0000 2017,@_paulthomas_    Very very significant. Not sure of the rules on WTA. Smart enough to play their year end finals earlier than the men
825785597365203000,Sun Jan 29 19:20:03 +0000 2017,@absurdities they would also benefit from legends being around.Similar to how everyone wins in golf from trickle down effect of having Tiger

825776274853474300,Sun Jan 29 18:43:00 +0000 2017,@big_ml  plenty of time for all of it if off-season was longer. One entity can't control another when we are "independent contractors"
