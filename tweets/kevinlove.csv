298863727304917000,Tue Feb 05 18:40:39 +0000 2013,But I digress. I really wanted to pay homage to a truly unique and remarkable rebounder and player in Bill Russell.

298852788836904960,Tue Feb 05 17:57:11 +0000 2013,@tomhaberstroh @TrueHoop I still feel like 51 Rebs is 51 Rebs. Kind of like Wilt scoring 100 Pts I don't care if the opposing C was 6-7.
