866749222720335900,Mon May 22 20:14:52 +0000 2017,The Dems can play in the Super PAC world, because a few billionaires can give unlimited amounts
866749149307338800,Mon May 22 20:14:35 +0000 2017,In order to raise big party money now, you need a lot of people who can give $330,000.

866749046932856800,Mon May 22 20:14:10 +0000 2017,5) The party fundraising caps were blown away in 2014 - per donor, parties can now collect $30K for gen funds...

866748892301471700,Mon May 22 20:13:33 +0000 2017,4) The fundraising numbers are a bit harder to pull apart because the RNC got some pretty big refunds and...
866748818204672000,Mon May 22 20:13:16 +0000 2017,3) The DNC is also still carrying debt. The R's aren't
866748780120604700,Mon May 22 20:13:07 +0000 2017,2) minor grain of salt: the RNC has more money locked into limited-purpose accounts. But that's not a huge problem
866748731722530800,Mon May 22 20:12:55 +0000 2017,1) The D vs R cash gap is pretty amazing, $25M for DNC+DCCC vs $73M for the RNC+NRCC

770319195313696800,Mon Aug 29 17:56:22 +0000 2016,6. This hack is different from past voterfile vendor hacks because it was apparently the actual state's db which contains more info and
770307834357620700,Mon Aug 29 17:11:13 +0000 2016,Here's the original yahoo story with, as far as I know, everything we know about this: https://t.co/dvzQE8y1ls
770307418295328800,Mon Aug 29 17:09:34 +0000 2016,5. However, as of right now we don't know that any of that has happened. Just a concern, and a reason for states to protect this info
770307226120646700,Mon Aug 29 17:08:48 +0000 2016,4. So if private info was stolen, there are identity theft risks and risks that malicious actors could change voter registration
770307008423571500,Mon Aug 29 17:07:57 +0000 2016,3. States store more than name/address/vote history, though, eg DOB, social security number &amp; with that info you can change your reg status
770306669612064800,Mon Aug 29 17:06:36 +0000 2016,2. But they seem to have shut down the IL registration system for a few days, which could be significant even if no PII was stolen
