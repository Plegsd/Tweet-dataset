772953798255874000,Tue Sep 06 00:25:20 +0000 2016,Big congrats to c9. I think all the NA teams are going to bootcamp in the same hotel :D. Excited to hangout with everyone in person.
772952295822626800,Tue Sep 06 00:19:22 +0000 2016,@MathTheLuck_ not blaming. Certain teams are way better on different  patches.  Impact is better without lane swaps. Clg/imt aren't .
772951908008861700,Tue Sep 06 00:17:50 +0000 2016,@BolisLorenzo not really. C9 impact and Jensen are 5 times better in this meta than lane swap meta. Otherwise c9 wouldn't be as good.

503693920748830700,Mon Aug 25 00:02:43 +0000 2014,CLG players say that Monte doesn't do anything. Please explain .  @Thooorin
503668660087423000,Sun Aug 24 22:22:20 +0000 2014,They've said worse things about us throughout the entire split. It's sad that the CLG fans can't handle a little truth.

503663934461587460,Sun Aug 24 22:03:34 +0000 2014,It's common behind the scene knowledge that he doesn't actually coach CLG. Pretty much every pro knows it. No one can honestly deny it.
503657098861764600,Sun Aug 24 21:36:24 +0000 2014,Nami and Kog'maw dominates Corki and Zilean in lane. So Curse needs to dodge it.
503656580680658940,Sun Aug 24 21:34:20 +0000 2014,Curse needs to 2v1 this game.
503654552533360640,Sun Aug 24 21:26:17 +0000 2014,I paid hai to compliment me.  Good job @Hai_L9
503650353846312960,Sun Aug 24 21:09:36 +0000 2014,CLG really needs an actual coach instead of a PR figure that pretends to be a coach to the public.
503648730298724350,Sun Aug 24 21:03:09 +0000 2014,Quas is playing really well despite getting completely camped.

503637874252595200,Sun Aug 24 20:20:01 +0000 2014,Doublelift is constantly dying first in teamfights. Its really difficult for CLG to do anything.
