544372719731875840,Mon Dec 15 06:05:44 +0000 2014,I just want to make music and make people happy. I don't want this to kill the band I've worked so hard at building.
544371110259986400,Mon Dec 15 05:59:21 +0000 2014,I'm disgusted and deeply upset by the bullying I've experienced today. I tried my best to be open, honest, and available.
544369723463696400,Mon Dec 15 05:53:50 +0000 2014,I'm speaking publicly about it because I want to make it clear to everyone, more clear than anything, that I DO NOT CONDONE Devin's behavior
544368817326288900,Mon Dec 15 05:50:14 +0000 2014,But I don't believe in ANY way that it lessens the violence of his words. What he did is flatly WRONG. I will not tolerate bigotry anywhere.
544368209542250500,Mon Dec 15 05:47:49 +0000 2014,So I just want to be clear: I mention the context of Devin's words because so many of you spoke so loudly demanding that I do.
544367812362637300,Mon Dec 15 05:46:14 +0000 2014,But it seems by taking your criticisms of me to heart, examining the context of Devin's words, I've pointed the gun back at myself.
544366410030678000,Mon Dec 15 05:40:40 +0000 2014,But rather to draw ppl's attention to the culture of the site, and the violent language and ideologies its users have numbed themselves to.
544365438613073900,Mon Dec 15 05:36:49 +0000 2014,In a text to my publicist that became a "statement" of sorts, I mentioned 4chan as being the context of his words. Not to excuse them(1/2)
544365128645640200,Mon Dec 15 05:35:35 +0000 2014,I maintained that the context of these words can't strip them of their violence. It seemed many people felt bigotry is OK if it's on 4chan.
544364070930247700,Mon Dec 15 05:31:22 +0000 2014,I got over 300 emails from strangers + friends, many harshly criticizing me for "throwing Devin under the bus", or betraying him etc etc
544361736116396000,Mon Dec 15 05:22:06 +0000 2014,80% of the response I got to my initial reaction criticized me for neglecting to account for their context. I said context was irrelevant.
544360643848306700,Mon Dec 15 05:17:45 +0000 2014,My only intention from the very beginning of this has been to condemn each and every one of Devin's sexist, racist, and homophobic remarks.
