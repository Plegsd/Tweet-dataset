865185632385151000,Thu May 18 12:41:43 +0000 2017,Just finished @JEPomfret's The Beautiful Country and the Middle Kingdom, a great history of the vital yet complex U.S.-China relationship.
864960861932326900,Wed May 17 21:48:34 +0000 2017,Trump's first 100 days were about political chaos. His next 100 days will be dominated by institutional conflict. The swamp strikes back.
864824942336118800,Wed May 17 12:48:28 +0000 2017,Russia offers to give Congress its Trump-Lavrov meeting summary. #Putin, aka Mr. Transparency, is having way too much fun with this chaos.
863005482700734500,Fri May 12 12:18:35 +0000 2017,I agree completely with @CharlesKrautham analysis of @realDonaldTrump's firing of #JamesComey and its implications. https://t.co/oQPV9MedGi
862183889502167000,Wed May 10 05:53:52 +0000 2017,The @FBI Russia probe was an awkward political problem for @realDonaldTrump. Comey's mistimed firing turns it into a full-blown crisis.
861281486921748500,Sun May 07 18:08:02 +0000 2017,It appears that #Macron will win the election in #France, reinforcing the firebreak against right-wing populism that the Dutch began.
859090142790918100,Mon May 01 17:00:25 +0000 2017,What's stunning is not @realDonaldTrump's willingness to negotiate with #NorthKorea, but that he would be "honored" to meet Kim Jong Un.
858085815234306000,Fri Apr 28 22:29:35 +0000 2017,My take on the strategic and diplomatic incoherence of the @realDonaldTrump administration in its first 100 days. https://t.co/pReZe0dm6R
854369592004792300,Tue Apr 18 16:22:38 +0000 2017,Gen John Kelly rightly sees @DHSgov as vital to national security but the Trump White House wants to downsize such non-defense agencies.
854365810894229500,Tue Apr 18 16:07:37 +0000 2017,General John Kelly @DHSgov spoke for an hour long at #GWU about the state of homeland security and never mentioned the great, great wall.

846851973215391700,Tue Mar 28 22:30:18 +0000 2017,Ironically, @POTUS order on coal is a net job loser. Coal is a dying industry but it can retard progress in the expanding green economy.

845371828277301200,Fri Mar 24 20:28:44 +0000 2017,To recap, @POTUS said who knew healthcare was so complex. @SpeakerRyan said who knew governing was so hard. Welcome to the real world.
844165958872776700,Tue Mar 21 12:37:03 +0000 2017,Rest in peace Martin McGuinness. Despite Northern Ireland's complex politics, he was more focused on solving problems than scoring points.
843950360825909200,Mon Mar 20 22:20:20 +0000 2017,Poor #Mexico. How long before @POTUS adds the theft of Brady's jerseys to his purported justification for the Great, Great Wall of Trump?
843921694851022800,Mon Mar 20 20:26:26 +0000 2017,Hopefully not lost in the hearing politics is #NSA Director ADM Mike Roger's view that our electoral system is critical infrastructure.

843905689768644600,Mon Mar 20 19:22:50 +0000 2017,I agree with @TGowdySC fully regarding the value of evidence. So how much evidence v. politics guided the Benghazi investigation?
843891992933404700,Mon Mar 20 18:28:24 +0000 2017,Good Lord, @PressSec says nothing has changed based on FBI Director Comey testimony. Really? Total debunk of @POTUS tweets, literally!
843860431961821200,Mon Mar 20 16:22:59 +0000 2017,Any way you look at it, #Russia's preference for Trump, the poor vetting of Flynn, and wiretapping tweets, this is a bad day for @POTUS.
843846347186982900,Mon Mar 20 15:27:01 +0000 2017,Investigating the compromise of classified information is appropriate, but it's chilling for @TGowdySC to potentially implicate the media.

842759011531407400,Fri Mar 17 15:26:20 +0000 2017,As he damages America's interests with looney responses, @PressSec should understand @POTUS is not his only client. https://t.co/PHztD3F5wT
842720990606123000,Fri Mar 17 12:55:15 +0000 2017,By the time appeals run their course, the administration should be able to complete its security review, mooting the ban's stated purpose.
842475457484345300,Thu Mar 16 20:39:36 +0000 2017,It is amazing/disconcerting that @POTUS and @PressSec keep doing backflips into the wiretapping hole, never mind putting the shovel down.

842356993704747000,Thu Mar 16 12:48:52 +0000 2017,As a national security budget, Trump increases offense and defense but cuts prevention, the third leg of the stool. The result is unstable.
842355600226934800,Thu Mar 16 12:43:19 +0000 2017,Trump's approach to national security mirrors his approach to health care: a sharp cut in preventive medicine. That's what @StateDept does.
842348124597284900,Thu Mar 16 12:13:37 +0000 2017,The @POTUS budget bottom line: the world is a mess, but it's not America's job to fix it. And our beautiful wall will keep bad things away.
842346030649737200,Thu Mar 16 12:05:18 +0000 2017,The Trump budget cuts @StateDept funding for climate change mitigation. Their thinking: problem doesn't exist, no need to help. Simple.
842344179250417700,Thu Mar 16 11:57:56 +0000 2017,The Trump budget sharply reduces @StateDept funding for Iraq and Afghanistan. But as wars wind down, development needs actually go up.
841382509233492000,Mon Mar 13 20:16:36 +0000 2017,Here in Washington, D.C., the snow better show up or @POTUS will start talking about fake weather, not just fake news.
839472520168341500,Wed Mar 08 13:47:00 +0000 2017,In his budget proposal, @POTUS is betting - wrongly - that there is a greater threat at the Mexican border than at a commercial airport.
839270272909848600,Wed Mar 08 00:23:20 +0000 2017,The EO signed yesterday drops the U.S. refugee target to 50,000, the lowest since the early 1980s. Yet the need today continues to expand.

838075691379871700,Sat Mar 04 17:16:30 +0000 2017,Just when you think @POTUS has turned a corner and become presidential, he reverts back to conspiratorial form with his #TrumpTower claim.
838073902593110000,Sat Mar 04 17:09:23 +0000 2017,Sad to hear of the passing of Rene Preval. Unlike his predecessors, he was able to retire as president of #Haiti and stay in the country.
837418547856949200,Thu Mar 02 21:45:14 +0000 2017,Attorney General Sessions did the only thing he could under the circumstances, an unforced error largely of his own making.
836765010407927800,Wed Mar 01 02:28:19 +0000 2017,Trump 1, McMaster 0. @POTUS repeats the term "radical Islamic terrorism" despite National Security Advisor's belief it is unhelpful.
836764357207928800,Wed Mar 01 02:25:43 +0000 2017,No reference to how @POTUS will pay for the "Great, Great Wall."
836763307327508500,Wed Mar 01 02:21:33 +0000 2017,Muted applause to @POTUS reference to decision to kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
835221948133158900,Fri Feb 24 20:16:44 +0000 2017,While @POTUS is right that he does not represent the world, calling the media enemies of the people is the wrong way to represent #America.

833856152194646000,Tue Feb 21 01:49:33 +0000 2017,LTG H.R. #McMaster is an excellent choice. He is a true strategic thinker, a key attribute for a successful National Security Advisor.

832418223685529600,Fri Feb 17 02:35:44 +0000 2017,When @POTUS said today that no president has done what he has done in such a short time, he's right. It's why we've survived for 240 years.
832306613759385600,Thu Feb 16 19:12:14 +0000 2017,If you are @POTUS, the leader of the free world, fixing the national "mess," where do you find time to collect all these grievances?
832305286803226600,Thu Feb 16 19:06:58 +0000 2017,An hour into the press conference, we finally get an answer that sounds presidential, regarding immigration. But it didn't last long.
832302765191942100,Thu Feb 16 18:56:57 +0000 2017,Just because the media headlines tomorrow will suggest that @POTUS was unhinged doesn't mean they're wrong. He's channeling Peter Finch.
832290796850262000,Thu Feb 16 18:09:23 +0000 2017,If @POTUS has been overly scripted in recent appearances, he has been unleashed in assessing his first 30 days in office.
832289304948916200,Thu Feb 16 18:03:28 +0000 2017,Can @POTUS be serious that his inheritance is "messier" than the dire circumstances that confronted @BarackObama in 2009? Not convincing.
831939717008654300,Wed Feb 15 18:54:19 +0000 2017,Yesterday @PressSec said Flynn lost @POTUS trust. Today Trump says it's all about leaks to fake media. The gang that can't talk straight.
831229585173930000,Mon Feb 13 19:52:31 +0000 2017,Distinguishing between the Canadian and Mexican pieces of #NAFTA helps @POTUS politically, but it is a trilateral trade agreement.
831225623154716700,Mon Feb 13 19:36:46 +0000 2017,Canada and @JustinTrudeau reminds the United States and @POTUS that you can be both open and secure. Yes, it's common sense.
831223113950040000,Mon Feb 13 19:26:48 +0000 2017,In his remarks with @JustinTrudeau, did @POTUS do a policy U-turn when he cited the value of hemispheric jobs? That would include #Mexico.
829309208973688800,Wed Feb 08 12:41:37 +0000 2017,.@KellyannePolls says @POTUS makes things up, but he also hits home runs. What's the metric for that, success above deception? That's #SAD.

827510742572232700,Fri Feb 03 13:35:10 +0000 2017,It appears @BarackObama asked @TurnbullMalcolm to "mentor" @POTUS. The lesson plan: Talk to Trump, head for the liquor cabinet. Repeat.
826986279724277800,Thu Feb 02 02:51:08 +0000 2017,It appears @POTUS is simplifying his duties. Given the Trump treatment, no allied leader will call him, visit him or invite him anywhere.

822959973575626800,Sun Jan 22 00:12:02 +0000 2017,The @PressSec called his first press briefing to argue about Inaugural numbers and a bust? It will be a long four years or short tenure.
822521882381582300,Fri Jan 20 19:11:13 +0000 2017,Digesting the Trump inaugural speech, he pledges to return government to the people. But we the people are deeply divided about its role.
822494387900969000,Fri Jan 20 17:21:57 +0000 2017,The new president deserves credit for a mercifully short inaugural address.

817439923737391100,Fri Jan 06 18:37:19 +0000 2017,The @realDonaldTrump intent to cut the #NSC staff by two-thirds ignores how complex national security policy is. https://t.co/Bj94R3bXL9
817387184659529700,Fri Jan 06 15:07:45 +0000 2017,OK, so Team Trump is disappointed in the preemptive leak of the report on #Russia's influence campaign which they preemptively disputed?
817146438551478300,Thu Jan 05 23:11:07 +0000 2017,Senators and witnesses distinguished b/w Russian election interference (no doubt) and influence (can't say), a nuance Trump should adopt.
817144603140825100,Thu Jan 05 23:03:49 +0000 2017,The #Senate on a bipartisan basis views #Russian interference with the election as an attack on America that merits a strong response.

816015141372391400,Mon Jan 02 20:15:45 +0000 2017,All for increasing @StateDept budget, but the incoming president's mandate is to save Damascus, Ohio, not #Syria. https://t.co/qBlBWAl0Tx

816008999703367700,Mon Jan 02 19:51:20 +0000 2017,Perhaps @realDonaldTrump is just confused about intelligence. It guides a president what to think about. It doesn't tell him what to do.
814103378427002900,Wed Dec 28 13:39:05 +0000 2016,While @realDonaldTrump sees @Twitter as a means to make his presidency "exciting," most White Houses prefer routine wins to cliffhangers.

805071152121081900,Sat Dec 03 15:28:14 +0000 2016,Interesting. @realDonaldTrump woos #Russia, where shared interests are narrowing, and fires a shot at #China, where they are expanding.
804905665806430200,Sat Dec 03 04:30:39 +0000 2016,Unpredictability got @realDonaldTrump elected, but his #Taiwan call shows how it can add major foreign policy risk without a clear reward.
804502523038015500,Fri Dec 02 01:48:43 +0000 2016,President-elect @realDonaldTrump calls General Jim Mattis a modern day Patton. But no one envisioned Patton as a Secretary of War.

785291196335738900,Mon Oct 10 01:29:45 +0000 2016,Trump has some momentum and just gave it back with the one on three comment.

780598076058636300,Tue Sep 27 02:40:58 +0000 2016,The question was whether Donald Trump could keep it together for 90 minutes. He went off the rails towards the end.
780596826038800400,Tue Sep 27 02:36:00 +0000 2016,To be president, you have to have STAMINA if you are going to negotiate good (not bad) deals that allow you to keep the oil.
780595572566855700,Tue Sep 27 02:31:01 +0000 2016,China would love to have total power over North Korea. Instead, they confront a vexing major power/client state dilemma.
780593897659625500,Tue Sep 27 02:24:22 +0000 2016,Hmm, after a two minute rant against the mainstream media over Iraq, Trump says he has the perfect temperament to be president.
780590887504121900,Tue Sep 27 02:12:24 +0000 2016,Say what? A U.S. government agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has endorsed Trump for President? Don't think so.

765266326193598500,Mon Aug 15 19:18:04 +0000 2016,Curious that @realDonaldTrump supports military commissions and ignores the strong record of terrorist convictions in civilian courts.
765264635012476900,Mon Aug 15 19:11:21 +0000 2016,It's unclear how #Russia makes the cut as a @realDonaldTrump ally against #ISIS. Putin opposes American exceptionalism and gay rights.

71263726505955330,Thu May 19 17:19:31 +0000 2011,#Obama committed the United States to supporting reformers. He was also specific about who has fallen short, particularly #Bahrain.
71227832432459780,Thu May 19 14:56:53 +0000 2011,More than just calling on countries to stop jailing activists, #Obama must identify clear consequences, and not just in #Syria and #Libya.
71224599207092220,Thu May 19 14:44:02 +0000 2011,#Obama should not just reaffirm the aspirations of people in the #MiddleEast. He should call out leaders who oppose the change they seek.

66674720082366460,Sat May 07 01:24:26 +0000 2011,The doubters of #binLaden's demise do not include #alQaeda, which acknowledged his death today. This seems to end questions about a photo.

65964293794971650,Thu May 05 02:21:27 +0000 2011,Appeared on @maddow discussing #binLaden. #Obama is right. A photo  release is most likely to inflame, not resolve any lingering debate.
65615283892658180,Wed May 04 03:14:37 +0000 2011,Told @BBC #binLaden photos should not be made public. We want to avoid not just a shrine, but also an iconic image that makes him a martyr.

64890258097061890,Mon May 02 03:13:37 +0000 2011,#AlQaeda is already diffuse, but it is likely to splinter even more, which creates potential dangers for us and vulnerabilities for them.

64884631312400380,Mon May 02 02:51:16 +0000 2011,#BinLaden's death does not eliminate the threat from #alQaeda, but it is hard to see anyone playing the same organizational role he did.
64883239889813500,Mon May 02 02:45:44 +0000 2011,#AlQaeda was having a bad year already, given its lack of relevance in current events. #OsamabinLaden's death is still a really big deal.
64536613836955650,Sun May 01 03:48:22 +0000 2011,The death toll in #Misrata dwarfs the loss of life in #Tripoli. But the sooner #NATO fully explains what happened, the better.
64535054575087620,Sun May 01 03:42:10 +0000 2011,Mistakes happen during conflict. If verified that #Qaddafi's grandsons died following an air attack, it could damage #NATO's credibility.
64002104804646910,Fri Apr 29 16:24:25 +0000 2011,Wrote in @thedailybeast that #Assad has lost his legitimacy to lead #Syria. We should say so now, when it matters. http://thebea.st/ijen0z

61243586867494910,Fri Apr 22 01:43:03 +0000 2011,Commiting #Predators to attack #Qaddafi's forces is not mission creep, but is a recognition that the existing NATO effort was not enough.
