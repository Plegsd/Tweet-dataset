362328382974869500,Tue Jul 30 21:46:32 +0000 2013,.@x_reticent as opposed to some films (Transformers, cough cough) where products pop up out of nowhere and serve no story purpose at all.
362328108587683840,Tue Jul 30 21:45:27 +0000 2013,.@x_reticent not the entire film, no. But you can bet they paid a good chunk of it. There the product worked perfectly with the story...
362326671300374500,Tue Jul 30 21:39:44 +0000 2013,.@x_reticent no doubt, I'd love to see more! Would love to see advertisers open the books and 'sponsor' great filmmakers.
362324969822232600,Tue Jul 30 21:32:59 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker @stefanoaltieri an exciting time, really. Thx for the thought provoking thread!
362324747004026900,Tue Jul 30 21:32:06 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker but back to your original point, the lines are blurring everywhere with branded content and all it's forms. @stefanoaltieri
362324371085332500,Tue Jul 30 21:30:36 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker my old directing teacher used to say that Cast Away was a two hour Fed Ex commercial. And it really is.

362322659482152960,Tue Jul 30 21:23:48 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker @stefanoaltieri yes, but I don't necessarily mean 5 minute webisodes. I'm talking an advertiser created series.
362321469553901600,Tue Jul 30 21:19:04 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker @stefanoaltieri but I do not think network or cable TV is where it will live.
362321184378986500,Tue Jul 30 21:17:56 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker @stefanoaltieri I do see a day when an advertiser 'creates' their own show. Then we may see the transmedia content u speak of.

362318172390572000,Tue Jul 30 21:05:58 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker not saying it's impossible. Just very difficult. And very time consuming to get all the pieces to line up.
362317641932738560,Tue Jul 30 21:03:52 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker brand managers, creative directors, strategists all have their agendas. And then it would have to blend with showrunners agenda
362317320967815200,Tue Jul 30 21:02:35 +0000 2013,.@milesmaker it sounds great in theory, but there's too much bureaucracy to get through at present. To many layers within ad industry.
362315058874814460,Tue Jul 30 20:53:36 +0000 2013,@milesmaker Ah, I see. So you mean ads featuring the cast of the show within the world of the show. Can it be done w/out cheapening show?
