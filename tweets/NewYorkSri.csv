423866894458703900,Thu Jan 16 17:18:37 +0000 2014,...and no @ForestWhitaker? #TheButler deserved better than this. Too many black artists for the Academy to handle??? #OscarNominations
423866312100560900,Thu Jan 16 17:16:18 +0000 2014,Cannot BELIEVE @Oprah didn't get an #OscarNominations. In favor of Amy Adams? Are you kidding me?!

420778758829010940,Wed Jan 08 04:47:28 +0000 2014,Best episode of #themindyproject in a long time. Hope they can stay on track from here.
420365361792688100,Tue Jan 07 01:24:46 +0000 2014,Why does it seem like the entire Housewives franchise has turned into a series of insipid doggy stories? #RHOBH #RHOA

412794401237516300,Tue Dec 17 04:00:29 +0000 2013,As a longtime fan of #RHOBH it's sad to see how pathetic this show has become. Remember when they used to have people drama not puppy drama?

404818139868708860,Mon Nov 25 03:45:40 +0000 2013,If only the legal system moved as quickly as it does on #TheGoodWife. They get years worth of court proceedings done in 1 day.
404350672038293500,Sat Nov 23 20:48:07 +0000 2013,The funniest show no one's watching? #TheNeighbors on @ABC. Sounds like a corny premise, but it's fantastic!

393953786655686660,Sat Oct 26 04:14:36 +0000 2013,#Episodes on Showtime is the most underrated comedy on TV. Check it out. Especially if you wanna know what it's really like to work in TV.
392793646463868900,Tue Oct 22 23:24:37 +0000 2013,Come on, #Parenthood. How many storylines of Drew flailing with girls until he finally comes out? Nobody's buying it.

353326149792837600,Sat Jul 06 01:34:53 +0000 2013,Wonderful discussion on #OWN about the lack of authentic black images in Hollywood. Followed by commercials for Tyler Perry's shows. Hmm...
352903492916092900,Thu Jul 04 21:35:24 +0000 2013,Who says you need guys to make a great buddy cop movie? Not when you've got Melissa McCarthy. #boysontheside #TheHeat

352191048585461760,Tue Jul 02 22:24:24 +0000 2013,I'm sorry, but #FoodNetworkStar is dredging the bottom of the barrel this season. Are these seriously the best "stars" they could find?
352163216832475140,Tue Jul 02 20:33:48 +0000 2013,@andersoncooper @ARTonAIR He sounds so much like you.
351877815446155260,Tue Jul 02 01:39:43 +0000 2013,OK, I thought it was gonna be super cheesy - and it is - but #Whodunnit on #ABC is also pretty f'ing fun.
351375892867584000,Sun Jun 30 16:25:15 +0000 2013,Quietly and steadily, @lisaling has crafted one of the best journalistic series on TV. #OurAmerica on #OWN.
350752949082914800,Fri Jun 28 23:09:54 +0000 2013,Super smart move for #OWN to air soaps during daytime. Same fans, same brand -- should've been doing it from the start.

349006810419695600,Mon Jun 24 03:31:22 +0000 2013,I could really go for a Hershey bar. #MadMen
348186676503380000,Fri Jun 21 21:12:27 +0000 2013,Good move, #FoodNetwork for dropping #PaulaDeen. People have the right to use racist humor - and fans have the right to end their support.
344278026936258560,Tue Jun 11 02:20:52 +0000 2013,Why, why on earth would you pick Pete, #BobBenson??? There are so many better knees to knock in that office. #MadMen
344275051564113900,Tue Jun 11 02:09:03 +0000 2013,Poor Sally Draper. Her therapy bill's gonna be through the roof. #MadMen
344155363513339900,Mon Jun 10 18:13:27 +0000 2013,@luvtoteach1 Wow! So powerful. You did an amazing job with the video. Honored to be a part of the legacy...

341392184844632060,Mon Jun 03 03:13:34 +0000 2013,I know it's the 70s and all, but these drug episodes are getting boring. #MadMen
339811455501209600,Wed May 29 18:32:19 +0000 2013,I'm APPALLED by the miserable excuse for a soap opera I saw last night. And dejected that great scripts are rejected for crap like this.
339804238744014850,Wed May 29 18:03:38 +0000 2013,Given the countless hours of mindless TV we all watch, if you can fit in just one hour to watch #Frontline, it'll change your life.
339548677544738800,Wed May 29 01:08:07 +0000 2013,I know I'm late to the party, but #Scandal is one juicy piece of television.
338859524473626600,Mon May 27 03:29:40 +0000 2013,Mr. &amp; Mrs. Draper, oh my! #MadMen
337396156579598340,Thu May 23 02:34:46 +0000 2013,I much preferred last year's LSD trip to this week's coke high. As far as #MadMen drug episodes go.
336485664549912600,Mon May 20 14:16:48 +0000 2013,The amount of creativity found in every corner of #DisneyWorld is simply inspiring. Even for a jaded NYer like me.
335789428331147260,Sat May 18 16:10:13 +0000 2013,@RobertNAnnaFTW So happy you're still watching it! Hope you had a fun night.
335545323374145540,Sat May 18 00:00:13 +0000 2013,#UniversalOrlando Harry Potter is fantastic. Doesn't matter how old you are, there's something undeniably magical about movie make-believe.
334011051748257800,Mon May 13 18:23:35 +0000 2013,At #Frieze, my first art fair. So interesting as an artist to be immersed in a whole other language of art I know nothing about.
333782720830394400,Mon May 13 03:16:16 +0000 2013,Don Draper, is this the beginning of the descent? #MadMen

333585807799619600,Sun May 12 14:13:48 +0000 2013,So sad my favorite comedy #HappyEndings got cancelled by ABC.
331414277896405000,Mon May 06 14:24:55 +0000 2013,Thank god for #CBSThisMorning. The only real journalism on morning TV.
331251015183654900,Mon May 06 03:36:11 +0000 2013,Only Joan could put Don Draper in his place like that. #MadMen builds characters/conflicts for years before the payoff. Superb writing.

327549788075733000,Thu Apr 25 22:28:49 +0000 2013,Sometimes, an artist works just for the $$$. Grateful for the paycheck... but hard on the heart.
327185629869924350,Wed Apr 24 22:21:47 +0000 2013,Writing retreat in #Boston to work on my NBC script. Grateful to be experiencing this city at such a powerful time.
326884354846490600,Wed Apr 24 02:24:38 +0000 2013,Just saw #TheRevisionist off-Broadway. Astounding. Vanessa Redgrave is beyond words. Jesse Eisenberg wrote and stars in a brilliant play.

321679132985552900,Tue Apr 09 17:40:56 +0000 2013,Can someone at #TheView please tell Elisabeth to stop scratching herself every time she speaks? It looks like she's picking her ass.
321435736383565800,Tue Apr 09 01:33:46 +0000 2013,Just discovered #Scandal for the first time, and I'm delightfully impressed. Soapy but smart -- and @kerrywashington is Emmy-worthy.
