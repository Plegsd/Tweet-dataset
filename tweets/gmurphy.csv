4934943593,Sat Oct 17 04:01:06 +0000 2009,Installed my new Withings ( http://www.withings.com ) scale - anyone want our old, accurate, BF-measuring, not-wireless scale?
4928794609,Fri Oct 16 23:08:04 +0000 2009,If the app store showed me updates for apps I'd uninstalled, I'd be even more excited. Though just a list of apps I owned would be OK.
4917586443,Fri Oct 16 15:02:15 +0000 2009,Finding myself using the Kindle iPhone app even when my actual Kindle is right next to me. It's all about switching cost.
4894322048,Thu Oct 15 17:54:08 +0000 2009,http://www.sublimetext.com/ is pretty sweet - finally a Windows editor with modern features, not yet sure if it beats VAX + VS.
4890028329,Thu Oct 15 14:46:19 +0000 2009,@yaoziyuan I just had to show that I had experience equivalent to a degree, which is what Google's lawyers helped me with. I have an E3.
4877138632,Thu Oct 15 01:10:21 +0000 2009,@yaoziyuan - no, I got it after - college degrees aren't required at Google if you have a good resume/folio, though they help a lot.
4867400780,Wed Oct 14 17:46:01 +0000 2009,Waiting for SF &gt; MTV shuttle - have a feeling I'm about to remember what I didn't like about living here.

4803929307,Mon Oct 12 07:12:51 +0000 2009,@bengoodger I prefer it (I actually use it) - windows grouped by app makes more sense than a randomly-ordered list of turds. Also, hover.
4799914386,Mon Oct 12 03:06:42 +0000 2009,The Cinnamon Chasers Luv Deluxe video is sweet.

4686254634,Wed Oct 07 16:42:55 +0000 2009,Trying to decide if I like CMSS-3D or Dolby Headphone more. For shitty work soundcards, the $20 Creative Xmod seems like great value anyway.

4641865540,Tue Oct 06 00:11:33 +0000 2009,Verdict: HD595s are awesome and super comfortable. The Astro MixAmp (for Dolby Headphone) makes them even more so. @mikepinkerton

4609120312,Sun Oct 04 19:08:50 +0000 2009,Cheese night last night - my favorite was the French-style Neufchâtel we brought back; might even like it more than King Island Blue Brie.

4538319907,Thu Oct 01 23:44:51 +0000 2009,Loved the Canon 10-22mm I rented - the expense of the full-frame equivalent is pushing me toward the 7D, away from the 5D2.
4532202861,Thu Oct 01 19:13:16 +0000 2009,I always thought I didn't "get" YouTube's popularity, but my account page says I've watched 4000+ videos, so apparently I don't need to.
4527567174,Thu Oct 01 15:50:24 +0000 2009,Astro A40 MixAmp arrived - Dolby Headphone does a good job of externalizing sound. Jury still out on quality until I get home to my 595s.
4509227262,Wed Sep 30 22:40:20 +0000 2009,The sucky part about visas is that vacations end in terrifying 'secondary processing', where you're never sure if you'll be let back in.
4465645739,Tue Sep 29 08:09:56 +0000 2009,Found Rue Mouffetard - cheese shops, bakeries and butchers; it's everything the Bay Area is missing.
4447791246,Mon Sep 28 17:28:27 +0000 2009,Constructing and eating ham and cheese baguettes on the banks of the Seine. Cliche much?
4440544320,Mon Sep 28 11:31:14 +0000 2009,Struggling to avoid tourist-trap food; the local signals are unfamiliar. Walking about 25km a day - feet getting sore.

4420758468,Sun Sep 27 17:12:19 +0000 2009,Enjoying two Leffes in Marais - loving Paris. We decided Cairo has the best cheap French Fries yet; Paris is yet to be tested.
4409948480,Sun Sep 27 04:13:25 +0000 2009,Arrived in Paris after an attention-screaming-children red-eye. I think I finally understand business-class.

4366660820,Fri Sep 25 11:59:11 +0000 2009,6 hours of Luxor - today was seriously fucking hot. Karnak Temple was as impressive as the pyramids.

4127080952,Sun Sep 20 17:17:32 +0000 2009,Today on bathroom adventures - electrocution of Glen by wet whitegoods and the final destruction of the hot water system. No naked running.

4116524082,Sun Sep 20 03:15:21 +0000 2009,Grape shisha destroyed my lungs at Sequoia, which lived up to the recommendations of everyone and was only at the end of our street.
4107724320,Sat Sep 19 18:52:17 +0000 2009,Got out of shower with blood nose just as hot water system exploded - ran screaming bleeding steaming naked through house of 8

4075723716,Fri Sep 18 09:57:54 +0000 2009,Air France flight sucked - fat guy with nightmares elbowed me in the head all trip, no in-seat entertainment and the food was American.

4043275555,Thu Sep 17 01:07:10 +0000 2009,It has been a day with long-awaited good news for each of us; two bits of happiness just before our long-long-awaited vacation.
4034684402,Wed Sep 16 18:13:06 +0000 2009,@andray - they charged me $150 when I moved here, and then sent it to the wrong side of the country; I finally got it all 4 weeks later.
3997412998,Tue Sep 15 03:55:15 +0000 2009,Trying to decide between a JVC SU-DH1 or an Astro MixAmp (want Dolby Headphone). Might be easier to just buy a regular HK receiver.
3950482254,Sun Sep 13 06:33:55 +0000 2009,Quite enjoyed Milk; Sean Penn was great.
3944652799,Sun Sep 13 00:25:57 +0000 2009,Having Lauren's parents in town has lead to more drinking than expected. I do not complain.
3939174652,Sat Sep 12 19:06:12 +0000 2009,Trying out some Foosh caffeine mints that jrg gave me; they only have to cure this morning's "no-access-to-Google-soda-fridge" headache.
3928817737,Sat Sep 12 05:15:51 +0000 2009,Impressed by new Sennheiser 595s - comfortable and I like hearing stuff around me. Not yet sure how they compare with my UE Super.Fi 5Ps.
3897234032,Thu Sep 10 22:03:41 +0000 2009,Just realized that I probably didn't need a Measles/Mumps/Rubella shot as I've already had real Measles and Mumps. Now with the dizziness.
3896228628,Thu Sep 10 21:13:27 +0000 2009,Getting a battery of vaccinations at work. Onsite clinics are super great.
3870823074,Wed Sep 09 20:27:48 +0000 2009,Woohoo, Rhino arrived - it was a tracking ID mixup rather than a package contents mixup, hooray.

3853798842,Wed Sep 09 01:34:30 +0000 2009,Woohoo, Textpad finally added incremental find. VAX+VS still has my heart, however.
3852128769,Wed Sep 09 00:14:03 +0000 2009,@mr_union V4 uses online activation instead.
3851839817,Tue Sep 08 23:59:52 +0000 2009,It appears that my copy of Rhino got sent to the wrong address; an insult added to physical-media dependence injury.
3845384258,Tue Sep 08 18:26:51 +0000 2009,@mr_union Holy smokes, a second you! Nice work old bean.
3830094663,Tue Sep 08 00:57:46 +0000 2009,Seriously impressed by Hypershot. I think I want the features of the Pro version, but the pricelist says 'call'. That can't be good.
3810264844,Mon Sep 07 02:20:24 +0000 2009,Enjoyed my burger at The Counter in San Jose more than I remember doing so at the Palo Alto store. Not sure why.
3803360746,Sun Sep 06 19:16:40 +0000 2009,Fleur de Cocoa in Los Gatos and then Kayaking in Elkhorn Slough. Lauren and I suck at co-op; I expect paddle beatings and a spot of capsize.
3793852214,Sun Sep 06 05:40:04 +0000 2009,Just had a superb beef short rib with roasted beets and horseradished mash at Calafia. The duck pizza was pretty great, too.
3780648229,Sat Sep 05 15:56:10 +0000 2009,Ugh, buying software (Rhino) and having to wait for physical media to be delivered so you can use it? #thiswassupposedtobethefuture
3763123155,Fri Sep 04 19:10:18 +0000 2009,Forgot how one-directional edits are in 3D. Spoiled by Photoshop's pseudo-non-destructive editing.

3674829249,Mon Aug 31 22:13:37 +0000 2009,Autodesk have made it really hard to find, evaluate and buy their products. Can't tell the difference between them and bugs break the trials

3594669053,Fri Aug 28 02:59:20 +0000 2009,@krave I see; it was you! I trust you! .. I suppose.
3586812695,Thu Aug 27 20:18:48 +0000 2009,http://diagrammr.com/ lets you create diagrams using sentences. I wish I had a non-confidential use for it.
3573152654,Thu Aug 27 04:48:17 +0000 2009,How is it I only found out about www.tetrisfriends.com today? Aside from Flash framelag, it is heavenly.
3545586338,Tue Aug 25 23:55:53 +0000 2009,http://tweet.im/ appears to bring Twitter integration back to GTalk (and hopefully iPhone push via BeeJive).

3528108164,Tue Aug 25 04:05:25 +0000 2009,Failing to notice the warnings, I ran Magnifique on Snow Leopard, and now I don't have any visible buttons. Poops.
3525214443,Tue Aug 25 01:28:34 +0000 2009,Paid actual money to 'subscribe' to Rock, Paper, Shotgun. Feel like some of internet weirdo.
3494011125,Sun Aug 23 16:27:54 +0000 2009,Hit the doubleup point with Twitter - when accessing something is so natural that exiting it to do 'something else' finds you relaunching it
3466351101,Sat Aug 22 04:38:50 +0000 2009,Margaritas, Violent Femmes and pre-parent cleaning. TJ's margarita mix not as good as Lime-Aid.
3457827956,Fri Aug 21 20:40:54 +0000 2009,Just when I thought it was getting boring, our cafe today had succulent brisket, thick mac and cheese, and an Elvis impersonator.

3292141902,Thu Aug 13 19:28:52 +0000 2009,Although the name initially makes as much sense as "Eating Swimming", I quite enjoyed my few minutes with the roguelike Wolfenstein RPG.

3250890983,Tue Aug 11 19:48:49 +0000 2009,No sleep after thinking about the wrong project for way too long. My work/work balance is way out of whack.
3200751921,Sun Aug 09 01:42:00 +0000 2009,Day of shopping, inverted - Lauren found lots, I didn't auto-love Diesel jeans, SF had fashionable people. Now for normality - BBQ and beer.
3195817798,Sat Aug 08 18:10:24 +0000 2009,I &lt;3 @app_engine and team; nothing beats it for prototypes and having the same environment across multiple computers. Want Launcher for PC.

3114597814,Tue Aug 04 00:28:07 +0000 2009,Brief flash of wanting Italian, small fish, for dinner; turns out 'fires in Sardinia' was visible on screen. Beware saccade advertising.

2829875776,Sat Jul 25 01:28:17 +0000 2009,@mr_union Can you recommend a step sequencer for a noob looking to mess around? Something like Fingerbeat on the iPhone, but .. bigger.
