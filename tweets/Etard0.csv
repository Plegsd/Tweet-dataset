839499580572053500,Wed Mar 08 15:34:31 +0000 2017,General observation about paneer &amp; why I dont like it: no matter what you mix it with paneer tastes like paneer &amp; never blends with anything

752024445724815400,Sun Jul 10 06:19:34 +0000 2016,@tweetria I know. Such beautiful feelings should not be kept trapped but let loose so they can create unbreakable bonds, but such is life.

752015436187856900,Sun Jul 10 05:43:46 +0000 2016,@tweetria makes sense. I just don't like to feel heavy hearted and moody romantically or non romantically. I'd rather be detached.

734458604510687200,Sun May 22 18:59:11 +0000 2016,@Akanshat13 acha.
734450764119179300,Sun May 22 18:28:02 +0000 2016,@Akanshat13 yes, do you miss me?
734301958673207300,Sun May 22 08:36:44 +0000 2016,@hemalitanna exactly. Most of thier arguments dont even make sense. Victory is purely based on validation/support from other feminists
734301416618139600,Sun May 22 08:34:35 +0000 2016,@hemalitanna especially people like a girl of her own words
734301322783129600,Sun May 22 08:34:12 +0000 2016,@hemalitanna So i just like to piss them off and make them quote me, and then i dont react at all
734301233247322100,Sun May 22 08:33:51 +0000 2016,@hemalitanna Sometimes i feel like indulging in such fights, but it is too much effort and takes up a lot of time. People start DMing n all
734299964688498700,Sun May 22 08:28:48 +0000 2016,@hemalitanna I need context here, i have no idea what fights you are referring to? My reply came from my personal experience.
734295695579058200,Sun May 22 08:11:51 +0000 2016,@schmmuck pick a fight with a twitter feminist. You will get quoted by all twitter celebs here who get RTs by being twitter feminists
734248685748518900,Sun May 22 05:05:03 +0000 2016,Hell is like when your mobile phone notification light is blinking in your peripheral vision, but you aren't allowed to check it.
733992174887575600,Sat May 21 12:05:46 +0000 2016,@Pinkzenjoy yes, why is that so unbelievable? :p
733987285557989400,Sat May 21 11:46:20 +0000 2016,@bizzarebhide haan ya that way yes :)
733986828852813800,Sat May 21 11:44:31 +0000 2016,@bizzarebhide hmm ya but sometimes shit gets more emotional and has nothing to do with an erection
733985652094697500,Sat May 21 11:39:50 +0000 2016,@twinitisha Wow nice :)
733985494443429900,Sat May 21 11:39:13 +0000 2016,@ChulbuliImli Yes, sad indeed!
733982532102959100,Sat May 21 11:27:27 +0000 2016,@ChulbuliImli ya i have witnessed too many times. Hence the tweet :)
733980654266896400,Sat May 21 11:19:59 +0000 2016,@ChulbuliImli so heart breaking, especially when you look up an online thesaurus to write a really well constructed sentence
733964512123064300,Sat May 21 10:15:50 +0000 2016,@sourabhgoswami I think me not reacting to them saying it was very reassuring for them that what they said was indeed right
733955450622873600,Sat May 21 09:39:50 +0000 2016,Someone recently told me their greatest fear is they'd become like me someday. I felt neither happy nor sad. So here's me growing up, guys!
733769916650823700,Fri May 20 21:22:35 +0000 2016,@TheFookFace sometimes, you cant help.
733769758701695000,Fri May 20 21:21:57 +0000 2016,@TheScarlettGirl usually such behaviour involves downplaying others' opinions and ideas to make oneself feel supeior
733745068381732900,Fri May 20 19:43:51 +0000 2016,@akashtattva Ive experienced cold, but there is no comfort so not sure
733744580974239700,Fri May 20 19:41:55 +0000 2016,@TheScarlettGirl I personally like those because at least there is a conversation. But some like to shut others down with long msgs.

733732703024078800,Fri May 20 18:54:43 +0000 2016,@wolfmiaow wow. Just did not see that coming
733731866092679200,Fri May 20 18:51:23 +0000 2016,They should invent a new word to describe that feeling of discontent you get when you read someone's one word reply to your 3 page text msg
733371232809320400,Thu May 19 18:58:21 +0000 2016,@pricisely I twitter searched for the word Zumba and there you were, making so much sense I couldn't help but fav it ;)
