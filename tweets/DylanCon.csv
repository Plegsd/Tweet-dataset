703011493487517700,Fri Feb 26 00:19:36 +0000 2016,@NeotipPro when you tell some one what happens in your daily life, should they verify it by interviewing you and analyzing your pics?
703011021292761100,Fri Feb 26 00:17:43 +0000 2016,@NeotipPro it must be exhausting determining that every photo or vid of an atrocity by regime is faked.
703009814113292300,Fri Feb 26 00:12:55 +0000 2016,@NeotipPro but I suppose you would say he faked the photos, the trauma and that the kids deserved it?
703009699441020900,Fri Feb 26 00:12:28 +0000 2016,@NeotipPro  like the teacher I met in Reyhanli who's school in Syria had been bombed by the regime killing many of his students.

702915978942881800,Thu Feb 25 18:00:03 +0000 2016,@NeotipPro Agreed there is no good war: US &amp; Russian planes, #ISIS, #Nusra, Hezbollah, Quds, forces kill #Syrians. Fact - #Assad kills more.

702703711173414900,Thu Feb 25 03:56:35 +0000 2016,@NeotipPro so in your moronic mind "everyone" (in previous tweet) means  "only the people of Syria not opposed to Assad ?" I see. Solid.
