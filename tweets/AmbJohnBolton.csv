856551729437044700,Mon Apr 24 16:53:40 +0000 2017,Objective of Trump admin should be to convince China that it's in their best interest to reunify Korean Peninsula as peacefully as possible.

855578151640080400,Sat Apr 22 00:25:01 +0000 2017,The serious threat posed by N Korea is direct consequence of 8 yrs of Obama’s failed foreign policy. "Strategic patience" was bad strategy.
855525808215134200,Fri Apr 21 20:57:02 +0000 2017,As long as this N Korea regime is in power, its irrational threats can someday actually happen. Only solution is to reunify the peninsula.

855435657845641200,Fri Apr 21 14:58:48 +0000 2017,Thoughts are with France today. ISIS has claimed the lives of too many innocents. Hopefully France's next president will step up offensive.
855188983055355900,Thu Apr 20 22:38:36 +0000 2017,There's no doubt #NorthKorea received substantial support from other State actors over the years, &amp; is likely still getting support today.
855092741881114600,Thu Apr 20 16:16:11 +0000 2017,When US says "give up your nukes," what N Korea hears is "give up your regime." They view nuclear weapons as tantamount to regime survival.
855079583942676500,Thu Apr 20 15:23:54 +0000 2017,For years GOP &amp; Dem admins have tried to coerce N Korea to give up their nuclear weapons program through economic sanctions. It has failed.

852171685780443100,Wed Apr 12 14:48:57 +0000 2017,There is really no point in negotiating with North Korea. They aren’t going to voluntarily give up their nuclear weapons program.
851913346672730100,Tue Apr 11 21:42:24 +0000 2017,US leaders focused on destroying ISIS in Syria &amp; Iraq should also focus on preventing Iran from benefiting the most when that war ends.

723577006970048500,Fri Apr 22 18:19:36 +0000 2016,Obama is in the #UK today lecturing the Brits. Simply said, it’s wrong for a #POTUS to inject himself into a debate like #Brexit.
723531067265835000,Fri Apr 22 15:17:03 +0000 2016,Obama is wrong, the US's minimalist role in the #Middle East has actually caused innumerable foreign policy blunders.

723223055468777500,Thu Apr 21 18:53:07 +0000 2016,Obama telling Saudis to share the region with #Iran is like telling the Poles to share the region with the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany.
723193333745487900,Thu Apr 21 16:55:01 +0000 2016,Obama says Saudis are on board for #IranDeal but we all know better. Unlike Obama, Saudis understand #Iran won't change &amp; is still a threat.
