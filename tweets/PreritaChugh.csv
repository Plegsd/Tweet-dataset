320587632985911300,Sat Apr 06 17:23:42 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg hahahhaha! Yaah. We take them for granted. But then we need to show our love for them in the form of words too ^_^
320134099002085400,Fri Apr 05 11:21:31 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg  I hope your best is enough to overcome sleep ;) And why 12:30 to 3?
320125077708484600,Fri Apr 05 10:45:40 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg And now you've made me curious too! :D
320124993600122900,Fri Apr 05 10:45:20 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg @Zomato Yeah. Seen that (On Zomato) Never tried it though. I have almost given up looking for Good Biryani in Delhi :(
320120158733623300,Fri Apr 05 10:26:08 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Aaahaaa!! The good things in life.
320117825245171700,Fri Apr 05 10:16:51 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Superb!! You are one lucky guy!!
320106786004799500,Fri Apr 05 09:32:59 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Thanks, I'll eat less. I am going there to diet :p  And you finally reviewed Rollmall @Zomato  Will be visiting soon :)
320099594967060500,Fri Apr 05 09:04:25 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg And since it is food, and there is a limit to how much I can eat (fortunately or unfortunately :p) will a 2 day trip suffice?
320092495734267900,Fri Apr 05 08:36:12 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Aye Aye Captain!!!
320091600090955800,Fri Apr 05 08:32:39 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Right. I'd thought so too. And those awesome kebabs in summers won't seem so great.
320089184234782700,Fri Apr 05 08:23:03 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg I must visit then!! How is the weather there?
320089083428864000,Fri Apr 05 08:22:39 +0000 2013,@Maneckk :)

318808086942973950,Mon Apr 01 19:32:25 +0000 2013,@sahibagursahane and look at the leaderboard now!! I refreshed my page several times before I could believe it.
318807862786813950,Mon Apr 01 19:31:32 +0000 2013,@Zomato Yeah a bit. This is worse than breaking up over an SMS :p  #flabbergasted
318319233698258940,Sun Mar 31 11:09:54 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Mamagoto I love :D And now, I want Chinese. Rollmaal sounds interesting, it'll be similar to Speedy Chow serving rolls instead?
318317249599524860,Sun Mar 31 11:02:01 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg Yeah, wheat momos I love. Never been so fond of hookah :) Must have been a killer combo for you!

318314300609556500,Sun Mar 31 10:50:17 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg O.O Baah!! I am jealous and hungry now!
318313700295594000,Sun Mar 31 10:47:54 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg and I suppose you'll still prefer the Kakori @ Al Kauser :D
318313055551361000,Sun Mar 31 10:45:21 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg hahaha. Talking about food :p #samecase  Try the Mutton/Chicken Burra @ Aap ki Khatir and update me on how were they
318311576593641500,Sun Mar 31 10:39:28 +0000 2013,@gaurav_gdg You are welcome :) You must! But I'll still rate Al kauser slightly higher than Aap Ki Khatir.
315858897397219300,Sun Mar 24 16:13:24 +0000 2013,@rockyandmayur @Maneckk   @sahibagursahane @rubal90 @rohitanand37  @Zomato A hell of an afternoon it was! I know I am late :D :D
