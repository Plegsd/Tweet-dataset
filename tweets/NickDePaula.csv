739962940388823000,Mon Jun 06 23:31:27 +0000 2016,@thelarrydraper That was the official statement that Nike went with. I think he just simply won MVP in the 6 &amp; was superstitious to go back.
739962612612370400,Mon Jun 06 23:30:09 +0000 2016,@CHold I kinda liked the 8. LOVED playing in them too. KD7 wasn't for me on court, but overall was a solid design and had tons of tech.
739962367174312000,Mon Jun 06 23:29:10 +0000 2016,@NNanpei For sure. But to then run that headline &amp; thought is a stretch.
739961860892426200,Mon Jun 06 23:27:10 +0000 2016,Durant's slow shoe sales the last 2 seasons have nothing to do with OKC market. KD9 has full-length Zoom Air + Flyknit at $150. It'll kill.
739961458503516200,Mon Jun 06 23:25:34 +0000 2016,Durant was hurt during the KD7 season and barely wore it on court. KD8 struggled at retail because it was priced too high at $180.
