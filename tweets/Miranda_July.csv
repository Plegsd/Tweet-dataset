132518066671202300,Fri Nov 04 18:02:23 +0000 2011,I will miss you too @Palomafaith ! Thank you for doing this and for your crazy, inspired video. Can't wait until we meet in person. xxx mj
132517843110604800,Fri Nov 04 18:01:30 +0000 2011,Right now, @Palomafaith : Clifford Owens, Pawel Althamer, Marie Lund. Historically: Sophie Calle and Harrell Fletcher were formative.
132517522405728260,Fri Nov 04 18:00:14 +0000 2011,Like Sophie wanted to be watched, @Palomafaith, like a child is watched, constantly. But in seeing the real child she realizes shes a woman.
132516296628764670,Fri Nov 04 17:55:21 +0000 2011,Little girls are pretty witchy+ritualistic @Palomafaith.I wanted 2 point at that. & I wanted 2 show she needed 2 be watched (unlike Sophie.)
132515253610229760,Fri Nov 04 17:51:13 +0000 2011,I think there are a few people u could make a life with, @Palomafaith. But its so rare to meet these people that it might as well just be 1.
132513518753816580,Fri Nov 04 17:44:19 +0000 2011,Or how one's sense of time changes as you get older, @Palomafaith.My sense of the future + mortality has changed so much in the last 10 yrs.
132512790626828290,Fri Nov 04 17:41:25 +0000 2011,Right, yes, @Palomafaith. But I also sometimes use "real life" as a much needed break from my inner world.
132511783482163200,Fri Nov 04 17:37:25 +0000 2011,Hard 1 @Palomafaith.I think the world I read about in the news is what I lazily call "real". But that doesn't mean it matters the most 2me.
132510901977886720,Fri Nov 04 17:33:55 +0000 2011,Yeah @Palomafaith. Too long for twitter....
132510168163422200,Fri Nov 04 17:31:00 +0000 2011,Im actually pretty shy when Im not working,@Palomafaith. But Im great in an emergency. I once sat with a stranger while he DIED.Not kidding.
132508910077739000,Fri Nov 04 17:26:00 +0000 2011,I throw away lots of ideas at the script level, @Palomafaith. Hundreds of drafts. But b/c Im so lo-budget,I don't shoot much unusable stuff.
132507783718375420,Fri Nov 04 17:21:32 +0000 2011,Don't sweat it, @Palomafaith. I'm using numbers 4 words!
132507640654868480,Fri Nov 04 17:20:58 +0000 2011,I used 2 be more outside, @Palomafaith, thinking I was 2 alone for love. But now I believe more in the inside -domestic life, family, etc.
132506988855824380,Fri Nov 04 17:18:22 +0000 2011,I do worry about air travel a lot, @Palomafaith. Better if we all fly, and die, together. Ok, let's change the topic!
132506683153977340,Fri Nov 04 17:17:09 +0000 2011,Of course ur not very good at computers @Palomafaith ...ur from the past! Altho I really liked all the different versions of u in the video.
132506075265114110,Fri Nov 04 17:14:44 +0000 2011,What if's=worries, @Palomafaith?Top 3 worries: what I'm making is no good, people I love will get killed, that I'm not working hard enough.
132504742827012100,Fri Nov 04 17:09:27 +0000 2011,I'm afraid of being physically unwell at the end of my life, @Palomafaith. But closer futures are pretty exciting 2 me. I lean towards hope.
132504332158504960,Fri Nov 04 17:07:49 +0000 2011,And is that your apartment @Palomafaith?! It looks really great. Ok, ok, let me answer your question. But seriously the video was so great.
132503972010393600,Fri Nov 04 17:06:23 +0000 2011,OMG, @Palomafaith this movie was kind of the best thing I've seen in a long time. I wish we could just hang out now?

50336120227110910,Tue Mar 22 23:20:40 +0000 2011,Although, in all fairness to myself I am eating a bowl of cereal at the same time.
50335801401294850,Tue Mar 22 23:19:24 +0000 2011,What's sort of funny about this is that you can see in real time how long i'm thinking about each one. Lena D would never take that long.
50335220020428800,Tue Mar 22 23:17:06 +0000 2011,But I know that is considered alienating on twitter, not the best use of it.

13840239663517696,Sun Dec 12 06:19:04 +0000 2010,I literally wore through my last pair by squirming in a chair for 6 months. Rachel Comey, I squirmed through your shorts.
13839453579649024,Sun Dec 12 06:15:57 +0000 2010,All I ask for in return is your understanding and a pair of small, black, high-waisted shorts.
13838252377120768,Sun Dec 12 06:11:11 +0000 2010,I have to admit that was pretty fun. Like having a store.

13833105693474816,Sun Dec 12 05:50:44 +0000 2010,It's an erotic novel from the 19th century. If you are having a sexual problem, this book might fix it.

12662652727726080,Thu Dec 09 00:19:46 +0000 2010,@melanielynskey ! i am sort of on, but can't fully get the hang of it like you and zooey d. but it was reassuring to see you on here.
11575820720017408,Mon Dec 06 00:21:05 +0000 2010,Ok, see you in a bit. sincerely, mj
11575754772979712,Mon Dec 06 00:20:49 +0000 2010,@jimhosking That's a good note to go out on Jim.
11575252811259904,Mon Dec 06 00:18:49 +0000 2010,Anyway, the point being, they won't be daily, but they will hopefully be important proclamations with strong hand gestures.
11573932658270208,Mon Dec 06 00:13:35 +0000 2010,There is something nice about how you feel like you're standing at a podium when you do this.
11573442545459200,Mon Dec 06 00:11:38 +0000 2010,So this isn't a permanent log off.
11573113149980672,Mon Dec 06 00:10:19 +0000 2010,Any time i feel a sudden announcement coming on, I come here.
11572834044223488,Mon Dec 06 00:09:13 +0000 2010,Which is no judgement on twitter. I think it will be perfect for sudden announcements.
11572353829965824,Mon Dec 06 00:07:18 +0000 2010,But what I really need is 1) time, and 2)empty, quiet space in which to have long thoughts.
11571971758235648,Mon Dec 06 00:05:47 +0000 2010,And I have tried really hard to think of way to do it that will create more of what I need.
11571020573974528,Mon Dec 06 00:02:00 +0000 2010,I think real, honest to god twittering might be the wrong direction for my life.
11161859805675520,Sat Dec 04 20:56:09 +0000 2010,I would open to tips, if people wanted to send sincere, helpful tips about twittering.
11161633665581056,Sat Dec 04 20:55:15 +0000 2010,I just had the realization that maybe it's not at all cool to do like 10 twitters in a row.
11161042386165760,Sat Dec 04 20:52:54 +0000 2010,But just so you don't feel self-conscious, @lizfraser1 , I'm not your intern. I'm the intern of another woman.
11159769305841664,Sat Dec 04 20:47:50 +0000 2010,@lizfraser1 Well now we have something in common because as you can see my twitter picture is of me hitting my head, but accidentally.
11155990342795264,Sat Dec 04 20:32:50 +0000 2010,In fact, the internship has already started. I don't even need to tell her. Necessarily.
11155621734776832,Sat Dec 04 20:31:22 +0000 2010,The only difference is that I'll be watching her and learning.
11155471029243904,Sat Dec 04 20:30:46 +0000 2010,But it shouldn't be too painful for her. She can just go about her normal life, doing everything as she normally does.
11154799823163392,Sat Dec 04 20:28:06 +0000 2010,But she doesn't know about the internship. And i'm a little nervous about inflicting it on her.
11154527931600896,Sat Dec 04 20:27:01 +0000 2010,And finally I've decided.
11154241339002880,Sat Dec 04 20:25:53 +0000 2010,I've spent a long time looking at followers, trying to decide who to intern with.
11153517339222016,Sat Dec 04 20:23:00 +0000 2010,So I can learn the ropes. The ins and outs.
11153367736786944,Sat Dec 04 20:22:24 +0000 2010,I think it would be best for me to intern with someone more experienced with twitter for a little while.
10201818495721472,Thu Dec 02 05:21:17 +0000 2010,And now it's done.
10201450395205632,Thu Dec 02 05:19:49 +0000 2010,About five years ago, I started making a movie.
10201402127155200,Thu Dec 02 05:19:38 +0000 2010,So.
10201312935280640,Thu Dec 02 05:19:17 +0000 2010,Thank you
10201164867969024,Thu Dec 02 05:18:41 +0000 2010,No, that's ok, I just want to have everyone's complete attention.
10201121788268544,Thu Dec 02 05:18:31 +0000 2010,I'm sorry, but there's a lot of noise in the back and it's making me feel like you guys aren't really listening.
