10166649127,Mon Mar 08 11:29:44 +0000 2010,@RahulBose1 Brando, what's this new look with beard, sunglasses, et al? You're looking like a mafia don! Nice contrast to Snehammoy in TJW!
10166598389,Mon Mar 08 11:27:45 +0000 2010,@atribini What do you want me to reply to? You never asked a question! Ask and ye shall be answered!
10166562639,Mon Mar 08 11:26:22 +0000 2010,@Saiyonee Yes, Masterclass is broadcast live on Monday evenings on the History channel. A filmmaker or actor is interviewed at length.

10159792240,Mon Mar 08 06:41:45 +0000 2010,@apurvnagpal When she'd laid just 1 egg we thought she was a new mum. Teenage pregnancy! But now there are two & she's fiercely possessive!
10159507955,Mon Mar 08 06:30:59 +0000 2010,@apurvnagpal Scripting The Japanese Wife took me about a couple of months from beg to end. But I was in touch with Kunal all the while.
10159351000,Mon Mar 08 06:25:11 +0000 2010,C'mon guys. Let's have some real interesting tweets on this Q from 'The Japanese Wife' team: How far would you go for love?
10129201344,Sun Mar 07 17:54:12 +0000 2010,Going to Bombay for Masterclass on 15th March. Should be fun. Also have to do subtitles for The Japanese Wife. 33 days to go! Whew!
10129091021,Sun Mar 07 17:51:04 +0000 2010,@Mittermaniac Didn't mean it in a derogatory way at all! Southie for me is an affectionate term. Like Bong for Bengali or Tambram...
10128971849,Sun Mar 07 17:47:43 +0000 2010,@ohcam_73 Yes, there is a S. Ind character in Iti Mrinalini too! Chintan Nair. An author. The abiding love of Mrinalini's life.
10128376668,Sun Mar 07 17:31:00 +0000 2010,@sardesairajdeep Totally agree! The Southies are the politest lot in India. No wonder I keep having S. Ind characters in my films! Eg, MMI!
10082178324,Sat Mar 06 17:29:56 +0000 2010,Shall be on the Masterclass on 15th March. Oops! The ides of March are almost come!!
10082134000,Sat Mar 06 17:28:43 +0000 2010,Just finished cutting 90 sec, 30 sec & 20 sec promos for The Japanese Wife. Feeling like a one-woman ad agency!
10080907078,Sat Mar 06 16:56:31 +0000 2010,@jiteshpillaai Thanks Jitesh. Promotional preparations in full swing now. Marketing team behaving like they have a wedding on their hands!!
9889617107,Tue Mar 02 20:21:31 +0000 2010,@apurvnagpal The author will also be down here from Ox to attend the premiere of TJW!  He's also done a Hitchcock in the film  by the way!
9887380943,Tue Mar 02 19:19:18 +0000 2010,@shouvikonline Yes, I should hope so!!!
9887079600,Tue Mar 02 19:10:52 +0000 2010,Hi everyone! Welcome Kalyan Ray @kalyanray1 - 'Ranju-da' of Antaheen! Welcome to Twitterworld Kalyan!
9886621042,Tue Mar 02 18:58:17 +0000 2010,@anushayadav But Konkona's always blaming me for steering her in the 'right' direction!!!
9886448894,Tue Mar 02 18:53:25 +0000 2010,@kunalbasu100 Thanks, K. My kite is very bad tempered nowadays. Guess she's having mood swings like most pregnant females!
9886391554,Tue Mar 02 18:51:49 +0000 2010,@Biorahul Screeching angrily at me most of the time! Doesn't realize I'm not being able to water that plant she's using as a nest!
9886325197,Tue Mar 02 18:49:57 +0000 2010,@kunalbasu100 Thanks, K. My kite is awfully bad-tempered. Guess she's having mood swings like most pregnant females!
9886190548,Tue Mar 02 18:46:10 +0000 2010,@Biorahul Hinduism never had a problem with nudity. Else Kali would never be portrayed as 'Nagnika'. This puritanism is a Victorian notion!
9886071388,Tue Mar 02 18:42:49 +0000 2010,@Biorahul But who are tehse self-styled guardians of Hinduism anyway, who presume to judge Hussain's art?
9885922331,Tue Mar 02 18:38:38 +0000 2010,@Shahid__k Happy Holi! BTW don't forget the real spelling of 'please' after this plz plz plz!
9885802116,Tue Mar 02 18:35:15 +0000 2010,@BDUTT Sharmila Tagore's was the most sane,intelligent and rational comment on Hussain in 60 mins. Found Chandan infuriating!
9790016548,Sun Feb 28 20:19:03 +0000 2010,Anil Kumble about Sachin Tendulkar: "I am fortunate that I've to bowl at him only in the nets!"
9789366759,Sun Feb 28 20:01:29 +0000 2010,@Payal_tweets That's up to you. I find it heartening to follow this bird esp with tragic events like Kabul & Chile happening all around us!
9743638378,Sat Feb 27 20:09:09 +0000 2010,Just peeked thru my bedroom curtains. Mum kite still sitting on her egg. Hard work, hatching!! This is getting to be like Nat Geo guys!

9718469925,Sat Feb 27 06:36:50 +0000 2010,Just took a photograph of the mum kite thru a chink in the curtain! Don't dare go up too close for fear of frightening her.
9717536257,Sat Feb 27 06:05:10 +0000 2010,Hi Kunal! How about tweeting once in a while?
9717348371,Sat Feb 27 05:59:17 +0000 2010,Hey! Welcome the 2 new entrants: Kunal Basu, author of The Japanese Wife (@kunalbasu100) & Aniruddha, director of Antaheen (@aniruddhatony)!
9717269360,Sat Feb 27 05:56:39 +0000 2010,@apurvnagpal Haven't seen KCK yet. Refuse to see all Bollywood movies unless strongly recommended! Would rather listen to Mozart! Ha! ha!
9717148726,Sat Feb 27 05:52:43 +0000 2010,Just saw the mum kite sitting on her egg! Screeched when she saw me! Keeping curtains drawn to give her privacy. No sunlight for a few days!
9717045284,Sat Feb 27 05:49:26 +0000 2010,A mum kite has just laid an egg in the flowerpot outside my window! Poor thing! We've taken away her trees with our hi-rises!
9716940515,Sat Feb 27 05:46:05 +0000 2010,@BDUTT Devastating! Human life's the most expendable product now!

9674722622,Fri Feb 26 12:01:00 +0000 2010,@bedit That was a different kite! That was a paper kite while this one's a real, live bird!
9674644452,Fri Feb 26 11:58:21 +0000 2010,Thanks guys! I think we'll let it build its nest. Won't open the window to that balcony until the fledging kites have flown away...
9674513569,Fri Feb 26 11:53:31 +0000 2010,Welcome Kunal Basu, the author of The Japanese Wife at @kunalbasu100! Welcome to twitterworld Kunal!
9674339850,Fri Feb 26 11:47:00 +0000 2010,Trees have been cut; high rises have come up. Where will the kites go? Or the elephants, or the Adivasi-s when we take away their forests?
9674194095,Fri Feb 26 11:41:24 +0000 2010,@apurvnagpal It was about a film that worked for u. U wrote it in reply to someone else; so I don't know what film u were referring to!
9674125848,Fri Feb 26 11:38:44 +0000 2010,A kite is trying its best to build its nest in our balcony while we keep clearing out the twigs it's collected! Feel terrible! What to do?
9668364887,Fri Feb 26 07:37:48 +0000 2010,@subhradipdas I expect Iti Mrinalini to release in June. But before that comes The Japanese Wife on 9th April in Kol, Mumb, Del & Bangalore!
9668294174,Fri Feb 26 07:34:57 +0000 2010,@vjrockss Reading Brian Bryson's 'A Short History Of Nearly Everything' with avid interest. It's a book on astrophysics. I must be INSANE!

9668165118,Fri Feb 26 07:30:04 +0000 2010,@RajeevMasand YES! All my films would then recover their cost!

9633390250,Thu Feb 25 16:47:08 +0000 2010,@iamtithi I'd love to make at least 1 film a year. Funding for so called 'art' films is the problem! Hope producers will note your tweet!

9622719156,Thu Feb 25 12:07:48 +0000 2010,@apurvnagpal I didn't actually watch Mamata speak. Just read about her rail budget and watched  the interior of her new train on tv.

9526909776,Tue Feb 23 14:10:22 +0000 2010,@suvobose My leg??? I wrote 'Break a leg' to Konkona because she had a play & that's the traditional good wish charm in theatre parlance.
9526608028,Tue Feb 23 14:02:26 +0000 2010,@Biorahul No, most don't dream. They 're-make' from other films!!!
