2880054781,Mon Jul 27 23:51:05 +0000 2009,4.I am not on Myspace, Facebook or any other social networking site. If u see one, not me. Again, flattering (slightly baffling) but not me.
2880005300,Mon Jul 27 23:47:51 +0000 2009,3.To clarify: annakendrick47 is my FIRST & only twitter. According to certain someone I "moved" here? So funny. And by funny I mean creepy.
