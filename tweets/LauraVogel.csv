716816925918117900,Mon Apr 04 02:37:27 +0000 2016,Downsides of #TheWalkingDead were: Negan monologue writing, all the insane commercials, &amp; I wanted more reaction shots from Daryl &amp; Mishone.
716816395984572400,Mon Apr 04 02:35:21 +0000 2016,Overall, #TheWalkingDead was very good, 7.5/10 in my opinion. Most points are for the superb acting and longterm character development.
