660751605562667000,Sun Nov 01 09:33:53 +0000 2015,@MarcSettle That you shouldn‚Äôt purchase a new phone based on the camera rating that DXOMark gave it‚Ä¶ (hint: Sony).
660750901326417900,Sun Nov 01 09:31:05 +0000 2015,After doing my own testing, I have come to the conclusion that DXOMark is not a reliable source when it comes to mobile camera tests.
660732803869339600,Sun Nov 01 08:19:10 +0000 2015,Had a great day testing the still cam capabilities of Sony X5 vs Nexus 6p VS iPhone 6s+. The results are totally unexpected. Review soon.
660729459981488100,Sun Nov 01 08:05:53 +0000 2015,Thank you @beastgrip - The BeastGrip Pro works beautifully with phones with protruding cameras like the Nexus 6p! https://t.co/1r2Wv3Tft9
660628621346738200,Sun Nov 01 01:25:11 +0000 2015,@beastgrip great! Will do.

660561859985014800,Sat Oct 31 20:59:54 +0000 2015,Google Music is so much nicer than Apple Music. Much easier to navigate. Apple could learn a few things about UI design from Google.

653666417896624100,Mon Oct 12 20:19:53 +0000 2015,@CamtasiaMac actually Camtasia was what worked when Screenflow wouldn‚Äôt. I was using footage recorded elsewhere. AWESOME APP!

653552939999465500,Mon Oct 12 12:48:57 +0000 2015,Ahhh success! @CamtasiaMac did what @ScreenFlow couldn‚Äôt: successfully export a video without adding black frames randomly. I‚Äôm a convert.

653508131964584000,Mon Oct 12 09:50:54 +0000 2015,@CamtasiaMac already wins hands down over @ScreenFlow for adding gestures. So much quicker and better animations. #winning

653482166593060900,Mon Oct 12 08:07:44 +0000 2015,@MarcSettle Well didn‚Äôt fix it. After exporting - just replaces green frames with black. Looks like starting from scratch. #byescreenflow

649734598948053000,Thu Oct 01 23:56:14 +0000 2015,@smartfilming I think that screen size would be very nice.
649734548696133600,Thu Oct 01 23:56:02 +0000 2015,@smartfilming Ethernet access is actually the biggest determining factor for me. iPhone supports it over usb hub - less so in iOS 9 though.
649733769033838600,Thu Oct 01 23:52:56 +0000 2015,@smartfilming I want Nexus because: 1) They get the updates first 2) They support ethernet (as does Sony - no one else does though).
649732338146906100,Thu Oct 01 23:47:15 +0000 2015,@smartfilming Honestly, if the Sony Xperia 5 comes to Australia before the Nexus 6p and LGv10 - I will go for that.

648240244353986600,Sun Sep 27 20:58:12 +0000 2015,Lots of tests are showing Samsung and LG take better pics than 6s+ - all of them use stock camera apps which I think is a flawed methodology
648238618876575700,Sun Sep 27 20:51:45 +0000 2015,@MarcSettle At $0.05 so called penny sweets!

648237824878080000,Sun Sep 27 20:48:35 +0000 2015,@MarcSettle You will be sad to hear that penny sweets do not exist here in Australia. We are talking $0.05 to get your foot in the door.
