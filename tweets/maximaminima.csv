290439990087921660,Sun Jan 13 12:47:44 +0000 2013,@sunainak no, its not about comparisons or tastes, its about mediocrity for me! I can't stand it when it comes to movies!

290433489143201800,Sun Jan 13 12:21:54 +0000 2013,@sunainak you can't just take a creative influence,outstanding actors, maybe half a thought and make a movie out of it. A script needs work
290433206124171260,Sun Jan 13 12:20:46 +0000 2013,@sunainak no, I'm saying that if there is sufficient effort put into something, it shows! Clearly here it doesn't show!
290429966670237700,Sun Jan 13 12:07:54 +0000 2013,@sunainak watch Gulal,you'll probably understand how creative influence from a play is taken fwd!Maybe,you need to watch more solid movies
290429246726348800,Sun Jan 13 12:05:02 +0000 2013,@sunainak intelligent my ass!He could ve done so much more with the subject.Plus,its a movie, not a play! Unless you're saying both are same
