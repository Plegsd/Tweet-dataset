752146327837012000,Sun Jul 10 14:23:53 +0000 2016,#BlackLivesMatter is on the streets &amp; social media, but what about homes? This starts with the education of children. Prejudice is learned.
752145579707338800,Sun Jul 10 14:20:55 +0000 2016,@AwkwardGirlLA I don't know about that. And of course, it was an honest move by MTV &amp; we all tried to contribute something valuable.

751639332641988600,Sat Jul 09 04:49:16 +0000 2016,@jerome1222 absolutely. That problem stems in the home, in the education of children. I can sway the tree some but this is about the root.

590928908301787100,Wed Apr 22 17:23:25 +0000 2015,@vanderstraat I compared the two for the sake of mutual understanding, which I hope is clear to anyone practicing compassion &amp; support.

541682251596320800,Sun Dec 07 19:54:47 +0000 2014,@penguins9000 you are protesting me. I am protesting you. We are having a conversation that may result in us growing. Nothing?
541681859705716740,Sun Dec 07 19:53:13 +0000 2014,.@penguins9000 I'm asking u right now 2 weigh centuries of violence&amp;oppression VS one unproven testimony. If u won't, I ask: admit your bias
541680774035296260,Sun Dec 07 19:48:55 +0000 2014,.@penguins9000 I marvel @ the notion that protesting does nothing or asking ppl 2 challenge themselves w/ other POVs is nothing. Its a start
541667392901111800,Sun Dec 07 18:55:44 +0000 2014,@penguins9000 so you vouch for Darren Wilson's character then? You're aware of his record, his history, his reputation as an honest cop?

541661799159201800,Sun Dec 07 18:33:31 +0000 2014,@penguins9000 ok, but what if it is indeed institutional racism? We all need to be willing to ask that question, at the absolute least. Fair
541660765527498750,Sun Dec 07 18:29:24 +0000 2014,@penguins9000 you trust cops to investigate themselves?
