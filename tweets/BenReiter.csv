924832679568142300,Mon Oct 30 02:57:48 +0000 2017,Were this game played at the pace of Game 1, it would have been over eight minutes ago. The fifth inning just ended.
924831569147080700,Mon Oct 30 02:53:23 +0000 2017,This is mental.
924831270131048400,Mon Oct 30 02:52:11 +0000 2017,Kershaw and Keuchel threw 58 sliders tonight. Just 27, or 47%, were strikes. Kershaw was at 68% during the regular season, Keuchel at 61%.
924819568396181500,Mon Oct 30 02:05:42 +0000 2017,His fortunes have improved. https://t.co/Ob0etb8tNl
924801024224665600,Mon Oct 30 00:52:00 +0000 2017,Keuchel threw three of his nine first inning sliders for strikes; Kershaw four of his five. Maybe the balls affect everyone but Kershaw?
924798060638568400,Mon Oct 30 00:40:14 +0000 2017,Since Game 3, Yuli Gurriel is hitless with one brutal, run-allowing throwing error.
924783826361921500,Sun Oct 29 23:43:40 +0000 2017,If the Astros have a save situation, says A.J. Hinch, "I'm not sure who it will go to, but it most likely won't go to Ken [Giles] tonight."
924756278097756200,Sun Oct 29 21:54:12 +0000 2017,Alex Cora, soon the Red Sox manager, kept his hand on Ken Giles's shouder all the way from the field to the dugout after BP. It was nice.
924712248207204400,Sun Oct 29 18:59:14 +0000 2017,Clayton Kershaw throws a slider 35% of the time. Dallas Keuchel throws a slider 19% of the time. Will be interesting to track this tonight.
924665383251882000,Sun Oct 29 15:53:01 +0000 2017,I 100% agree with all those who are saying that Verlander should get the Starbucks app. Might be the second most important story here.

924657890056704000,Sun Oct 29 15:23:14 +0000 2017,Neither Charlie Morton nor Alex Wood throws a slider, by the way, though Morton tells Verducci the slicker ball still affected him.
924655769206837200,Sun Oct 29 15:14:49 +0000 2017,Lance McCullers easily sensed the difference by blind feel test. Justin Verlander says autographing one is like signing a Starbucks receipt.
924653318940610600,Sun Oct 29 15:05:05 +0000 2017,They say the ability to throw a slider is particularly affected. You know who throws a lot of sliders? Ken Giles and Yu Darvish.

924470333746245600,Sun Oct 29 02:57:58 +0000 2017,A reminder that Ken Giles has allowed at least one run in five of his six postseason appearances, and this game is tied at 1-1 in the 9th.

652686859563200500,Sat Oct 10 03:27:28 +0000 2015,All four of the Mets hits against Kershaw so far have been produced by their lefthanded hitters.
652685214288773100,Sat Oct 10 03:20:56 +0000 2015,It's quite possible that Cuddyer's gaffes forced deGrom to make 15 extra pitches. He's at 80 pitches through four; Kershaw's at 65. Hmm.
652678337182040000,Sat Oct 10 02:53:36 +0000 2015,Cuddyer's miscues harmful to Mets for many reasons. That one cost DeGrom a much-needed seven-pitch inning. It's 91 degrees.
652672131252121600,Sat Oct 10 02:28:56 +0000 2015,That pitch that Justin Turner scorched at Cuddyer was DeGrom's first (and thus far only) sub-97 mph fastball. (It was a piddling 96.)
652671180936122400,Sat Oct 10 02:25:10 +0000 2015,Don't look at Cuddyer's mentions right now if there are kids in the room.
652669966043353100,Sat Oct 10 02:20:20 +0000 2015,While DeGrom's throwing crazy heat, Kershaw struck out the last two batters on pitches of 75 and 74 mph. Different approaches so far.
652666509257392100,Sat Oct 10 02:06:36 +0000 2015,Jacob DeGrom's first eight pitches, in mph: 97, 97, 97, 97, 98, 97, 97, 98. He just might be a little amped up.
