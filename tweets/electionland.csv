790980655387643900,Tue Oct 25 18:17:38 +0000 2016,So, when you say “Short story ... voter fraud is a real concern,” your conclusion is just as wrong as your overuse of ellipses. 8
790980559086444500,Tue Oct 25 18:17:15 +0000 2016,Signature fraud is hard for the same reasons any in-person voter fraud is hard:you have to know which voters won’t be showing up to vote. 7
