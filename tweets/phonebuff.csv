1055964230686363600,Fri Oct 26 23:27:46 +0000 2018,@BrewerRonnie I think most iPhone users coming from anything other than the iPhone X/XS will love it (as long as they didnt use 3D touch).
1055963841320824800,Fri Oct 26 23:26:13 +0000 2018,@DexterC73 Screen looks fine to me. Nothing wrong with the iPhone XR. Just that the iPhone X definitely feels more premium.
1055949636530188300,Fri Oct 26 22:29:46 +0000 2018,My first impression of the iPhone XR is that iPhone X owners should feel pretty good about their phone.

435241323671466000,Mon Feb 17 02:36:32 +0000 2014,@DetroitBORG 30 Hz is fine for me, but if 60 Hz doesn't come around I'll probably sell it when/if Apple updates it's Thunderbolt to 4K.
435240814914965500,Mon Feb 17 02:34:31 +0000 2014,@DetroitBORG I got the Dell UP3214Q. So far so good. Just waiting for Apple to (hopefully) whitelist it for 60 Hz support. Only 30 Hz now.

434789481686630400,Sat Feb 15 20:41:05 +0000 2014,@tldtoday @hudsonwisler Do it.
434037870706192400,Thu Feb 13 18:54:27 +0000 2014,@MKBHD @tldtoday Ah okay. In that case, I can't wait till I get charged for over 6K lol
434037026061418500,Thu Feb 13 18:51:05 +0000 2014,@tldtoday How long did it take to ship after they initially charged your card? I still haven't even been charged for mine yet :(
434005364518830100,Thu Feb 13 16:45:16 +0000 2014,@tldtoday I'm kind of happy. Wasn't a fan of the uneven bezels.
433781473238188000,Thu Feb 13 01:55:37 +0000 2014,Just about done with the design refresh for the website. What do you guys think? http://t.co/jJgRrOFo6k

433728863844057100,Wed Feb 12 22:26:34 +0000 2014,@GeekyNerdDad @UnboxTherapy No, I think they'll just add support for more 4K displays at 60 Hz. They only support the Sharp and ASUS one now
433714463145861100,Wed Feb 12 21:29:20 +0000 2014,@superscientific Expensive :) UP3214Q
433714313262399500,Wed Feb 12 21:28:44 +0000 2014,@UnboxTherapy It's OK. There's definitely cursor lag but otherwise not bad. Great quality and of course resolution. Can't want for 60 Hz tho
433713132221894660,Wed Feb 12 21:24:03 +0000 2014,@UnboxTherapy Loving it. 30 Hz right now until Apple updates to support 60 Hz though.

430952816937402400,Wed Feb 05 06:35:32 +0000 2014,@BenCofield1 I wish I could but the XPS 27 I have has no inputs outside of HDMI... which is a bad design if you ask me.
430934816117112800,Wed Feb 05 05:24:01 +0000 2014,@larrivee013 I am considering it but it doesn't support 60 Hz on the Mac Pro out of the box. Have to wait for Apple to update.
430867426712899600,Wed Feb 05 00:56:14 +0000 2014,@tldtoday Saw that earlier.... don't know if I can resist!
430856257361018900,Wed Feb 05 00:11:51 +0000 2014,@tldtoday That's pretty much where I'm at. I'm looking at the ASUS PQ321Q that @mkbhd bought since the Mac Pro supports it out of the box.
430854876315131900,Wed Feb 05 00:06:22 +0000 2014,@tldtoday Yes we are... What do you use?
430853075226488800,Tue Feb 04 23:59:12 +0000 2014,@tldtoday No, just HDMI with a maximum of 1080p. Not sure if I want to get a 4K monitor yet. Was hoping to hold out for one with TB support.
430848427325263900,Tue Feb 04 23:40:44 +0000 2014,Looks like my Dell XPS 27 won't accept 1440p via HDMI..... Meaning I have to get a new monitor for the Mac Pro. Suggestions?

426063797074145300,Wed Jan 22 18:48:19 +0000 2014,@UnboxTherapy So true. Before I knew what it was, I always thought "favorite" was a way to bookmark a tweet haha.

425001920512536600,Sun Jan 19 20:28:48 +0000 2014,@alandm10 All good choices honestly. Different pros and cons for each. But by March there might be new phones to consider as well.

423871847516483600,Thu Jan 16 17:38:18 +0000 2014,@MKBHD @superscientific Of course by the time that happens, the content of these "future proof" videos will be outdated. haha
423871517798043650,Thu Jan 16 17:36:59 +0000 2014,@MKBHD @superscientific True. I'll rephrase it: Everything else being equal, 4K is more future proof...
423870053205803000,Thu Jan 16 17:31:10 +0000 2014,@superscientific At this point, I think creating content in 4K is more about future proofing than anything else.
