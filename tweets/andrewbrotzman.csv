24117460571,Fri Sep 10 16:09:05 +0000 2010,@yemblog @andygadiel my favorite is 12/11/95. trey loops his own peak and sails over it. incred.
22597131325,Tue Aug 31 07:46:12 +0000 2010,@cdirksen hear hear. most underrated show of fall 97. worcester &gt; hampton that year imo. begging for a remaster @shapsio!
22423518429,Sun Aug 29 08:40:07 +0000 2010,@cdirksen there is an SBD of that 8/16/93 reba available on the 8/20/08 from the archives show if you don't have it. (also 6/28/00 gin!)
20468216845,Fri Aug 06 13:24:44 +0000 2010,@nugsnet making the latest show the featured show sold me on the LP app. and it's amazing. archives feature is GREAT. Great job.
20226445994,Tue Aug 03 14:40:12 +0000 2010,@shapsio loving the Road to Vegas single disc... Great, great mix and great selection. Worth an official, in-store CD release imo. #phish
20226384878,Tue Aug 03 14:39:19 +0000 2010,@DavidPoland ever find any hard numbers on VOD revenues? especially for indies. looking forward to your part 2 reply to Ted Hope too.
19976023636,Sat Jul 31 07:29:41 +0000 2010,@davidlowery totally agree, can't wait
18430540058,Tue Jul 13 11:44:59 +0000 2010,oh mighty... loving the YEM and especially the DWD &gt; Free from the 'Past Summer Compilation' available here http://bit.ly/cpqupF #phish
18421907180,Tue Jul 13 08:23:29 +0000 2010,@shapsio I hear you on the confidentiality... Would love more writing about the thinking behind LP. Liked your old myspace blog a lot
18385577701,Mon Jul 12 22:07:00 +0000 2010,@mattzollerseitz re: Lewis Black...I started watching at 6:10... and enjoyed it. then I kept watching until what he said at 7:00! all right!
18385081880,Mon Jul 12 21:59:13 +0000 2010,@mattzollerseitz Tax cuts make you wealthy, banks lending & war made you poor. Driving a new car into a wall doesn't mean the car was faulty
18384781926,Mon Jul 12 21:54:11 +0000 2010,@mattzollerseitz Yes, I'm an Obama voter. That doesn't mean tax cuts don't make you wealthier. READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF YOUR F.E. ARTICLE
18382964008,Mon Jul 12 21:21:24 +0000 2010,@mattzollerseitz war spending and the fallout of private companies' actions are clearly different issues
18382587372,Mon Jul 12 21:14:31 +0000 2010,@mattzollerseitz unemp. ins. = incentivizing others not to work. tax breaks for wealthy = incentivizing expansion. why is this debatable?
18344122671,Mon Jul 12 10:13:13 +0000 2010,@shapsio would also buy an Aug. 93, Nov. 94, Dec. 95, or Fall 97 compilation box set... sort of a ten disc ALO from a single tour #phish
18344002274,Mon Jul 12 10:10:18 +0000 2010,@shapsio am pretty desperate for 12/30/93, Summer 95, 11/21-22/97, 11/28-30/97, 12/6/97, 12/31/99, or a fall/dec '99 compilation.
18343942267,Mon Jul 12 10:08:52 +0000 2010,@shapsio any chance you could do a post somewhere about what gets an official livephish release? or timeline for more archive releases?

8241788824,Tue Jan 26 16:46:26 +0000 2010,@paulfischer you're shooting someone down for being "pretensious" when they've drawn their film on the smallest canvas possible; incredible
8237383208,Tue Jan 26 14:44:27 +0000 2010,@paulfischer what were you trying to do with this review? criticize EM for being smart? not being commercial, though he never tried to be?
5447634483,Thu Nov 05 11:57:41 +0000 2009,@Jon_Reiss is your book going to be available in the UK?
5424259127,Wed Nov 04 16:40:59 +0000 2009,@karinalongworth you need a UK sim card and an unlocked iphone. are you at 3.1 or 3.01? unlock for 3.1 is pricey but 3.0 is cheap and quick
