896587753680363500,Sun Aug 13 04:22:32 +0000 2017,In summary: I think it all works out in end, and cloud vendors buy up infra startups or they die. So I wouldn't worry about it too much. üòÄ
896587543113678800,Sun Aug 13 04:21:42 +0000 2017,5) Basically, everyone gets monolith++ and then easier SoA transition.
896587410212913200,Sun Aug 13 04:21:11 +0000 2017,4) Over time, tech will be sucked into cloud products, such that when running CaaS or FaaS, startups just get better stuff from get go.
896587225806196700,Sun Aug 13 04:20:27 +0000 2017,3) They will pick the best techs that lead to fast shipping and success, which is always monolith and then services later.
896586989046190100,Sun Aug 13 04:19:30 +0000 2017,2) I think problem is self correcting. App startups will ship quickly with good product or fail themselves.
896586745625456600,Sun Aug 13 04:18:32 +0000 2017,Because of failure rate, users very suspicious about startup tech. Much happier with community driven. Remember why I didn't start company?
