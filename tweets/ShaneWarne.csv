896600613374484500,Sun Aug 13 05:13:38 +0000 2017,This is more like it Saints, the game is there to be won if you want it boys !!!!!!! Intensity, composure &amp; kicking skill will get it done ✅
896582914065944600,Sun Aug 13 04:03:19 +0000 2017,Big games test the character &amp; heart of players, today so far has shown plenty about a lot of players &amp; how the hierarchy overrate some !
896581713408675800,Sun Aug 13 03:58:32 +0000 2017,This is embarrassing &amp; hurtful watching this pathetic display by the Saints. I think the hierarchy are overrating a lot of players #cantkick
896578391121338400,Sun Aug 13 03:45:20 +0000 2017,I'm a passionate Saints fan &amp; will support them. But that was absolutely pathetic &amp; the worst 1/4 I've seen from any team for a long time !
896576144790528000,Sun Aug 13 03:36:25 +0000 2017,No composure, panicking, can't kick, stupid handballs, not ferocious in tackling &amp; a lack of intensity = St Kilda !!! Absolutely pathetic
896574088801468400,Sun Aug 13 03:28:14 +0000 2017,What the hell is going on at the G ? Have the Saints players ever kicked a footy before ? Saints are panicking &amp; have no composure !!!! 😡😡😡

861884974483423200,Tue May 09 10:06:05 +0000 2017,Surely suspension shouldn't rely on wether the tackled player concussed or not,some players just get knocked out easier #AFL360 #consistency
861884496831848400,Tue May 09 10:04:11 +0000 2017,I agree that we want youngsters who play #AFL to be looked after but we were all taught as a kid, go in hard for the footy &amp; tackle hard too
861881477218181100,Tue May 09 09:52:11 +0000 2017,You're wrong on #AFL360 re Waite/Stevens. They were not sling tackles, we want players to be ferocious in their tackling &amp; be hard at it !

860783324473606100,Sat May 06 09:08:31 +0000 2017,Why does incorrect disposal never get paid anymore in the #AFL ? The umpires must reward the tackler, it's getting to the disgraceful stage
860651212466569200,Sat May 06 00:23:33 +0000 2017,J. Coates has served Aust sport well. But it's definitely time for change &amp; to take our athletes to the next level @danniroche1 has my vote

860437756136218600,Fri May 05 10:15:21 +0000 2017,I know the AFL give everything to the GWS &amp; it's a joke the luxuries they get, but they can't also get all the umpiring decisions too 😩😡
860434427448512500,Fri May 05 10:02:08 +0000 2017,Why do the umpires no longer pay incorrect disposal, Saints not being rewarded for some wonderful &amp; aggressive tackling #AFLSaintsGiants
860355882378379300,Fri May 05 04:50:01 +0000 2017,Facts. GWS best for centre clearances, Saints the worst &amp; not a surprise but the Saints have the least free kicks in the comp. Come on umps
