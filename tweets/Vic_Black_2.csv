689124982828318700,Mon Jan 18 16:39:33 +0000 2016,Martin Luther King Jr. trusted his life and his work to this very God. May we remember him as this:
689124894202658800,Mon Jan 18 16:39:12 +0000 2016,Character is forged by the trust and belief in God, who walks with us through EVERY situation, that loves us and died for each of us.
689124755694207000,Mon Jan 18 16:38:39 +0000 2016,We seek to make judgements based on the pigmentation of one's skin rather than engage and uncover the character of every individual.
689124695556268000,Mon Jan 18 16:38:25 +0000 2016,He did not see color rather he insisted our CHARACTER be what is displayed, judged and ultimately remembered. This is where we have failed.
