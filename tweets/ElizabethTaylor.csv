19304534034,Fri Jul 23 02:39:42 +0000 2010,Every breath you take today should be with someone else in mind.  I love you.
19304493357,Fri Jul 23 02:39:03 +0000 2010,Because then it becomes about yourself...which is wrong.  Giving is to give to God.  Helping is to help others.
19304416130,Fri Jul 23 02:37:48 +0000 2010,That is the thing that will give back to you all the rewards that there are.  Don't do it for yourself, because then it becomes selfish.
19304304587,Fri Jul 23 02:36:00 +0000 2010,Give.  Remember always to give.  That is the thing that will make you grow.
19304242308,Fri Jul 23 02:35:02 +0000 2010,You are who you are.  All you can do in this world is help others to be who they are and better themselves and those around them.
19304117295,Fri Jul 23 02:33:00 +0000 2010,Never let yourself think beyond your means...mental, emotional or any otherwise.
19304039253,Fri Jul 23 02:31:46 +0000 2010,I would like to add something to my earlier tweet.  Always keep love and humility in your heart.
19299361319,Fri Jul 23 01:20:23 +0000 2010,Not at least until I'm dead, and at the moment I'm having too much fun being alive...and I plan on staying that way.  Happiness to all.
19299277276,Fri Jul 23 01:19:07 +0000 2010,No one is going to play Elizabeth Taylor, but Elizabeth Taylor herself.
19299174264,Fri Jul 23 01:17:31 +0000 2010,Hold your horses world.  I've been hearing all kinds of rumours about someone being cast to play me in a film about Richard and myself.

13905412579,Thu May 13 10:01:18 +0000 2010,I thought doctors, like priests took an oath of confidentiality.  May God have mercy on his soul.
13905379710,Thu May 13 10:00:24 +0000 2010,Just what we want in our doctors.  And then to say he did not betray Michael's confidence.  No wonder he has death threats.
13905339086,Thu May 13 09:59:18 +0000 2010,with someone in "Arnie's" office.  It seems he supplies not only women (Debbie Rowe), but men too...how convenient.
13905294642,Thu May 13 09:57:54 +0000 2010,Dr. Arnie Klein declared on May 2 that he did not betray Michael Jackson by saying publicly that he had a homosexual relationship
13752979119,Mon May 10 22:59:51 +0000 2010,God bless her always.  I'll miss her.
13752957830,Mon May 10 22:59:25 +0000 2010,Lena Horne...one of the most beautiful women in the world passed away today.  Her dignity and grace and talent shall be remembered forever.
13541506486,Fri May 07 10:44:11 +0000 2010,@kathyireland.  Darling, I'm still in London. Wishing you every success at Gearys on Saturday. Love, Elizabeth
12053470991,Mon Apr 12 16:06:58 +0000 2010,The rumors regarding my engagement simply aren't true.  Jason is my manager and dearest friend.  I love him with all my heart.
10294408523,Wed Mar 10 23:26:59 +0000 2010,When is someone going to stop the yellow press from lashing out at people who no more deserve it than the Dalai Lama!
10294398155,Wed Mar 10 23:26:44 +0000 2010,I am boiling to the point of eruption at the injustice of those statements.
10294391171,Wed Mar 10 23:26:34 +0000 2010,I have never seen anyone epitomize glamour and grace and professionalism like she did.
10294366108,Wed Mar 10 23:25:56 +0000 2010,These rags said, to quote them, ‚ÄúShe was either stoned or drunk and looked pregnant‚Äù ‚Äì what???? They must be the ones on drugs.
10294341019,Wed Mar 10 23:25:19 +0000 2010,I heard that some scum magazines, print and internet trashed Kathy Ireland on Oscar Red Carpet night.
7811256234,Sat Jan 16 02:14:11 +0000 2010,@KathyIreland.  Darling, Congratulations on your beautiful "Monkey Mischief" at Neiman-Marcus.  I bought them!  I love you.

5185488025,Mon Oct 26 22:56:28 +0000 2009,I truly believe this film should be nominated in every category conceivable.
5185468197,Mon Oct 26 22:55:40 +0000 2009,You see in front of your eyes Michael's genius blossoming on this piece of film thanks to Kenny Ortega and his crews.
5185429707,Mon Oct 26 22:54:07 +0000 2009,From A to Z you get Michael's input on every level. Michael's genius at work with the dancers. Mr. Ortega catches Michael in his every mood.
5185367930,Mon Oct 26 22:51:34 +0000 2009,Kenny Ortega did a masterful job of directing the process that goes into making a complete show before hitting the stage.
5185335016,Mon Oct 26 22:50:15 +0000 2009,We cannot let his life be in vain / and always done with love.  Remember that.  Remember him and thank God for him and his genius.
5185286312,Mon Oct 26 22:48:16 +0000 2009,From "Black And White", "Man In The Mirror". The inspiration behind "We Are The World".  We must take his words of responsibility seriously.
5185212057,Mon Oct 26 22:45:19 +0000 2009,I won't use words like preaching because that is off-putting, but listen.  Listen to his messages.
5185156687,Mon Oct 26 22:43:03 +0000 2009,If you listen to his lyrics they are those of a modern day prophet and it beseeches us to listen to him and what he sang.
5185093782,Mon Oct 26 22:40:28 +0000 2009,I meant to repeat myself.  I love you.  I remember Michael loved you.  He was totally up to now and the message of today in all his songs.
5185054662,Mon Oct 26 22:38:54 +0000 2009,I hope I don't sound condescending.  I'm sure you already know what I'm talking about, but go to see it again and again.
5185015101,Mon Oct 26 22:37:19 +0000 2009,I loved genius in my lifetime.  God was so good to me.  I will love Michael forever  and so will you, if you don't already.
5184971622,Mon Oct 26 22:35:33 +0000 2009,You owe it to yourselves and your loved ones to see this again and again.  Memorize it  and say to yourselves, "I saw genius in my lifetime"
5184929628,Mon Oct 26 22:33:49 +0000 2009,To say he was a genius seems so little.  I wish my vocabulary encompassed what I feel.
5184884780,Mon Oct 26 22:32:00 +0000 2009,God blessed him and squandered nothing, but loved it all.  Michael knew how to put together every tone, every nuance to make magic.
5184835021,Mon Oct 26 22:30:03 +0000 2009,And we have this piece of film to remind us forever and ever that once there was such a man.  God kissed him.
5184799093,Mon Oct 26 22:28:31 +0000 2009,I wept from pure joy at his God given gift.  There will never, ever be the likes of him again.
5184758050,Mon Oct 26 22:26:47 +0000 2009,To say the man is a genius is an understatement.  He cradles each note, coaxes the music to depths beyond reality.
5184720001,Mon Oct 26 22:25:14 +0000 2009,It is the single most brilliant piece of filmmaking I have ever seen.  It cements forever Michael's genius in every aspect of creativity.
5184662536,Mon Oct 26 22:22:50 +0000 2009,I was honored with the great privilege of seeing "This Is It" last week.  I was sworn to secrecy, but now I can let you know about it.
4719790475,Thu Oct 08 23:13:14 +0000 2009,I know they all helped.  Love you, Elizabeth
4719780491,Thu Oct 08 23:12:47 +0000 2009,Dear Friends, My heart procedure went off perfectly.  It's like having a brand new ticker.  Thank you for your prayers and good wishes.
4682066926,Wed Oct 07 13:35:19 +0000 2009,by saying that I had diabetes, which is a total lie.  But I guess they can't help themselves.  Talk to later as promised.  Love, Elizabeth
4682035788,Wed Oct 07 13:33:46 +0000 2009,Dear Friends,  I was completely honest with you about my hospitalization.  Now the press, bless their little hearts, had to add something
4661943486,Tue Oct 06 18:52:45 +0000 2009,Any prayers you happen to have lying around I would dearly appreciate.  I'll let you know when it's all over.  Love you, Elizabeth
4661919590,Tue Oct 06 18:51:38 +0000 2009,It's very new and involves repairing my leaky valve using a clip device, without open heart surgery, so that my heart will function better.
4661896410,Tue Oct 06 18:50:33 +0000 2009,Dear Friends, I would like to let you know before it gets in the papers that I am going into the hospital to have a procedure on my heart.
4464020664,Tue Sep 29 05:50:20 +0000 2009,Please join me in voting for her on abc.com until noon tomorrow.  God Bless.
4463990799,Tue Sep 29 05:48:12 +0000 2009,Kathy was delightful, gorgeous and fit the music they chose perfectly.  If they ever do a remake of The King and I she should star in it.
4463963566,Tue Sep 29 05:46:16 +0000 2009,Saw Dancing With The Stars tonight.  Didn't think the judges were fair to Kathy Ireland.
4302377994,Wed Sep 23 00:13:37 +0000 2009,All of you who are watching Kathy Ireland on DWTS tonight...please vote for her.  The # is on the screen.  She's so gorgeous, isn't she!
3368703145,Mon Aug 17 20:54:50 +0000 2009,She is beauty personified because it glows from within and takes her on wing.
3368688348,Mon Aug 17 20:54:00 +0000 2009,To watch her in movement will be a golden chance to see beauty in action and grace which is what that lady is all about.
3368665450,Mon Aug 17 20:52:42 +0000 2009,I'm so excited to see Kathy Ireland on Dancing With The Stars!  She is so beautiful.
2701938533,Sat Jul 18 05:00:42 +0000 2009,I give love and I'm surrounded by love...and I thank God for that.
2701927577,Sat Jul 18 04:59:53 +0000 2009,I have to be stronger and more appreciative of what I do have.
2701919247,Sat Jul 18 04:59:09 +0000 2009,I've had many tragedies in my life, but I guess they have all taught me something.  I have to look at it that way.
2701906546,Sat Jul 18 04:58:04 +0000 2009,But as I said before I went into the hospital, "I am a survivor."
2701867989,Sat Jul 18 04:54:47 +0000 2009,I'm home from the hospital sore, but intact.  Of course I'm still grieving for Michael...I always will.
2503317685,Mon Jul 06 21:28:09 +0000 2009,My love goes out to Katherine and Michael's beloved children.
2503303979,Mon Jul 06 21:26:58 +0000 2009,I said I wouldn't go to the Staples Center and I certainly don't want to become a part of it.  I love him too much.
2503291432,Mon Jul 06 21:25:53 +0000 2009,I just don't believe that Michael would want me to share my grief with millions of others.  How I feel is between us.  Not a public event.
2503274853,Mon Jul 06 21:24:27 +0000 2009,And I cannot guarantee that I would be coherent to say a word.
2503254677,Mon Jul 06 21:22:42 +0000 2009,I've been asked to speak at the Staples Center.  I cannot be part of the public whoopla.
2488761661,Sun Jul 05 23:29:35 +0000 2009,I will always love Michael from the depth of my being and nothing can separate us.
2488751127,Sun Jul 05 23:28:39 +0000 2009,I am a survivor not only for myself, but for my family and for Michael too.
2488740526,Sun Jul 05 23:27:43 +0000 2009,Although my grief over Michael could not be any deeper, I am not on suicide watch as some of the cheaper "rags" would have you believe.
2488720914,Sun Jul 05 23:26:01 +0000 2009,I wanted you my friends to know that I'm going into the hospital Wednesday or Thursday to complete a test I was in the middle of.
2349932023,Fri Jun 26 21:08:07 +0000 2009,I keep looking at the photo he gave me of himself which says, "To my true love Elizabeth, I love you forever."  And I will love HIM forever.
2349904704,Fri Jun 26 21:06:00 +0000 2009,I can't imagine life without him.  But I guess with God's help I'll learn.
2349878643,Fri Jun 26 21:04:01 +0000 2009,I don't think anyone knew how much we loved each other.  The purest most giving love I've ever known.  Oh god!  I'm going to miss him.
2349849487,Fri Jun 26 21:01:51 +0000 2009,It can't be so.  He will live in my heart forever but it's not enough.  My life feels so empty.
2349830532,Fri Jun 26 21:00:27 +0000 2009,I was packing up my clothes to go to London for his opening when I heard the news.  I still can't believe it.  I don't want to believe it.
2349814213,Fri Jun 26 20:59:17 +0000 2009,We had so much in common and we had such loving fun together.
2349790789,Fri Jun 26 20:57:27 +0000 2009,My heart...my mind...are broken.  I loved Michael with all my soul and I can't imagine life without him.
2246104618,Sat Jun 20 00:06:00 +0000 2009,Dearest Elizabeth, You make the sun shine, the clouds move and the world spin.  So many people love you and so do I.  Love Always,______
2246090588,Sat Jun 20 00:04:48 +0000 2009,Somebody I care for very much sent the following note to me with flowers and I wanted to share it with you.
2241875257,Fri Jun 19 18:29:23 +0000 2009,Life without earrings is empty!
2231050910,Fri Jun 19 00:58:45 +0000 2009,Humor is the only way to stay alive.
2084905459,Tue Jun 09 02:53:53 +0000 2009,My mind, my soul were transported by his beauty, his voice, his inner being.  God has kissed this man and I thank God for it.
2084890018,Tue Jun 09 02:52:25 +0000 2009,I went to see Andrea Bocelli last night.  The first time I've been out in months.  The Hollywood Bowl allowed me to use my wheelchair.

1951821747,Thu May 28 21:08:36 +0000 2009,I think it's terrible for the California govt to retract the law on Gay Marriage after they made it legal.  You can't treat people that way!
1951766673,Thu May 28 21:03:19 +0000 2009,The perfume company wants me to name my new fragrance VIOLET EYES.   I think its conceited and like FOLLOW ME.  Which do you prefer?

1942221807,Thu May 28 01:50:58 +0000 2009,It's a shame more public servants don't have San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's courage in speaking out against Prop 8.  Go Gavin!
1942015016,Thu May 28 01:30:03 +0000 2009,There is no such thing as a "Gay" agenda.  It's a human agenda.  The California Supreme Court decision on Prop. 8...TERRIBLE!!!!
1927758954,Tue May 26 20:43:34 +0000 2009,I'm home from the hospital and feeling great.  Thanks for all the love and  support!
1886482540,Fri May 22 20:31:01 +0000 2009,@kathyIreland Thanks Darling for the beautiful flowers and all the prayers.  Now can you just get my puppy past hospital security.  Love
