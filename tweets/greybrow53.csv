1824182653,Sun May 17 07:20:53 +0000 2009,New song out - http://sirenscall.notlong.com - found a great female singer. Her name's Essence and she does a great job of this.

1740279432,Fri May 08 18:57:59 +0000 2009,@beefybarrow Would that make it your current serial of choice?
1730902505,Thu May 07 20:56:38 +0000 2009,Off to Swindon tomorrow, home of the magic roundabout (a real one). In Swindon, driving the wrong way round a roundabout constitutes fun!

1719312305,Wed May 06 18:48:04 +0000 2009,Wine flu is now spreading through Serbia. It seems that it is passed on through people's salivavic.
1709447791,Tue May 05 20:04:56 +0000 2009,Presumably wine flu would be known as the V1N0 strain. teehee
1708619201,Tue May 05 18:34:21 +0000 2009,Sitting drinking a glass of Cava thinking that the next big pandemic should be wine flu - that would be worth catching! :)
1704425775,Tue May 05 08:20:16 +0000 2009,@beefybarrow Thxs for the thumbs up and the plug - nice to know that it's not just me that likes the music :) Have a great week both of you
1704404239,Tue May 05 08:14:54 +0000 2009,Gr8 weekend! Watched Wolverine, ate at Pizza Express, went for drinks to my Sister-in-Laws and chilled out big time. Roll on Whitsun!!
1603952488,Fri Apr 24 14:18:37 +0000 2009,Looking forward to a weekend of sowing some vegetables, drinking some wine and just chilling out. Hoorah!
1603945103,Fri Apr 24 14:17:43 +0000 2009,Haha! I promise not to read the stuff not intended for my eyes. Of course I'll have to read it first, just to be sure! :)
1594431938,Thu Apr 23 14:24:41 +0000 2009,Aaaarghh! I'm supposed to be writing questions about stock market data feeds but the sun is shining. It's too nice to work from home!
