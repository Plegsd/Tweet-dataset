221312763497168900,Fri Jul 06 18:40:49 +0000 2012,@WendyWegerer All speed is relative. A connected locomotive &amp; caboose going 70mph relative to a post are going 0mph relative to each other.

221308555683299330,Fri Jul 06 18:24:06 +0000 2012,@maxmathforum For this exercise, think of the sun as stationary. (Hence, my speed relative to the sun.) Direction is an element of velocity.
