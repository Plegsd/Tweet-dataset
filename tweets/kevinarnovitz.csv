397577235780993000,Tue Nov 05 04:12:54 +0000 2013,@kpelton We're doing the lord's work here.
397576449852321800,Tue Nov 05 04:09:46 +0000 2013,Clippers: 42 pts in 27 possessions. By the end of the night, their league-leading offense should be 6 whole points ahead of 2nd-ranked Off.

397574984589013000,Tue Nov 05 04:03:57 +0000 2013,...and Los Angeles has a ton of polyamorous basketball fans (and college fans), loathe as they are to admit it.
397573501743149060,Tue Nov 05 03:58:04 +0000 2013,Those are Clippers fans booing Howard. To them, Howard was a civic/Los Angeles affront, not a Lakers affront. Besides, fans love to boo.
397570437506273300,Tue Nov 05 03:45:53 +0000 2013,I like Asik on the floor, but he's definitely simplifying LAC's defensive decision-making.
397500219257921540,Mon Nov 04 23:06:52 +0000 2013,Right about now would be a good time to get Damian Lewis some touches. The offense is stagnant and not much fun to watch.
