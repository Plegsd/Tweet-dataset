672645928956747800,Fri Dec 04 05:17:41 +0000 2015,I would wear that poppy costume in real life I'm not ashamed it is gorgeous #TheWiz

672486792742899700,Thu Dec 03 18:45:20 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies So to wrap this up, I hope you find some happiness in your life that doesn't include degrading other people.
672486272724635600,Thu Dec 03 18:43:16 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies I hope you realize the consequences it has, maybe not on me, but on my family and fans, who I care really deeply about.
672485992016666600,Thu Dec 03 18:42:09 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Although you and your friends will probably just ignore this and keep doing it or move onto someone else...
672485203126816800,Thu Dec 03 18:39:01 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Anything is better than making fun of somebody else. Even if it's supposed to be a joke or "everyone else is doing it"
672484797084598300,Thu Dec 03 18:37:24 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Try voicing your opinions on the upcoming presidential election, maybe racism or feminism. Bring important issues to light
672484598555652100,Thu Dec 03 18:36:37 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Make a video about the importance of not bullying, that would be ironic for you. But hey it can help somebody else not do it
672484340186529800,Thu Dec 03 18:35:35 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies of the day, I'm still living my life and doing great, while others are suffering and need attention to their situations
672484205943652400,Thu Dec 03 18:35:03 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies We have so many other causes to bring attention to other then "I don't like that girl on Disney Channel." Because at the end
672484079351140400,Thu Dec 03 18:34:33 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies I ask you to do this instead, use your googling pictures, video editing talents on something good.
672483952091762700,Thu Dec 03 18:34:02 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Even though I'm a person who can take the heat &amp; I would much rather you make fun of me then someone else i care about
672483777550016500,Thu Dec 03 18:33:21 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies &amp; then advertising it so I would see it. That seems like someone who actually just wants attention and lash out to get it
672483616551669800,Thu Dec 03 18:32:42 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies For someone who obviously doesn't like me, you have chosen to spend part of your day, googling pictures, editing videos...
672483418286886900,Thu Dec 03 18:31:55 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Y'know this is funny to me that you, &amp; a bunch of people on the Internet, have chosen to make fun of me, for some reason.
672483292952727600,Thu Dec 03 18:31:25 +0000 2015,@breadcrumblies Hi, no need to have other people tag in this, I saw it.
