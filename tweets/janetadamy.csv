184310762330791940,Mon Mar 26 16:08:04 +0000 2012,Kendall: As Verrilli sits down, it appears he faced much less hostile questioning than Long, who argued for delaying decision until 2014.

184307555915399170,Mon Mar 26 15:55:20 +0000 2012,Kendall: Verrilli responds that the arguments are different because the two legal questions are different.
184307431751434240,Mon Mar 26 15:54:50 +0000 2012,Kendall: Alito notes that gov is arguing mandate penalties are not a tax, but on Tues, the gov will argue that penalties do work like a tax.
