691943753947443200,Tue Jan 26 11:20:21 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 @MUFC_SAF I'd take Mourinho. Guardiola would be ideal, but I suspect he's already committed to City.
691942386029707300,Tue Jan 26 11:14:55 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 @MUFC_SAF Yeah, I don't mean to sound snobbish, but we have a much better team. You can't argue that.
691941612478406700,Tue Jan 26 11:11:50 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 @MUFC_SAF That's not a good enough excuse. He should still do better with this team. We're losing to teams like Norwich.
691940369831981000,Tue Jan 26 11:06:54 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 @MUFC_SAF It's not "the minute a manager is having a hard time." LvG is halfway through second season, and it's not improving.
691930229854572500,Tue Jan 26 10:26:36 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 Yeah, possibly. But it sounds like he's already offering to go, and they want him to stay, which sounds crazy to me.
691929716710858800,Tue Jan 26 10:24:34 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 Yes, again, I'm not saying it's all LvG. All I'm saying is, it's not working out and he needs to go- if not now, then the summer
691929313390780400,Tue Jan 26 10:22:58 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 I don't think it is all his fault, but you can't say he's performing to the best of his ability.
691928264999329800,Tue Jan 26 10:18:48 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 But you can be defensive and entertaining. That's expected with a team as big as United. One shot on target at home isn't enough
691927949994496000,Tue Jan 26 10:17:33 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 Well, yes.
691927180276801500,Tue Jan 26 10:14:29 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 If there were signs of improvement, we'd be hopeful things will change. But there aren't.
691927064706965500,Tue Jan 26 10:14:02 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 I agree. But it could also be a lot better. It's not just the results, it's the style of play. We're boring, and not improving.
691926550426550300,Tue Jan 26 10:11:59 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 Either way, it's still not good enough. We still have big players, and LvG isn't getting the best out of them. It's awful.
691925591638032400,Tue Jan 26 10:08:11 +0000 2016,@smithy2786 Don't think anyone can say he's not a top manager. It just isn't working out for him at United. His philosophy doesn't fit.

387249634470797300,Mon Oct 07 16:14:42 +0000 2013,@diogonev @tip_cam I don't think it would be that flexible. Think of a shatterproof ruler; it's hard and strong, but it doesn't crack.

387246374678716400,Mon Oct 07 16:01:45 +0000 2013,@TiP_Cam Should mean that the display won't crack as soon as you drop it on a hard surface.

300922138796380160,Mon Feb 11 11:00:03 +0000 2013,@c_davies Exactly! You could fit a wardrobe and a chest of drawers in the back of that thing with space left over. And it’s bulletproof.
300921735329493000,Mon Feb 11 10:58:27 +0000 2013,@c_davies I want his car.

300901815778697200,Mon Feb 11 09:39:18 +0000 2013,@Matt_Sand This is really weird. I haven’t been able to get on Cult of Mac from a mobile device from a while, but I can on a Mac.
300901633347428350,Mon Feb 11 09:38:34 +0000 2013,@Matt_Sand Are you using an iOS device?

300897981916393500,Mon Feb 11 09:24:03 +0000 2013,@Matt_Sand What kind of app are you looking for?
300877098342559740,Mon Feb 11 08:01:04 +0000 2013,@theiBlog Yeah, that is a problem — especially since Mailbox isn’t on other platforms yet.
300875244774756350,Mon Feb 11 07:53:43 +0000 2013,@theiBlog gets forgotten. I'm hoping Mailbox will help with that. It's just a shame I mostly use Android now. :)
300875045528563700,Mon Feb 11 07:52:55 +0000 2013,@theiBlog I quite like the idea of turnings emails into tasks, though. My inbox is full of stuff I need to action, and a lot of it...
300872205493993500,Mon Feb 11 07:41:38 +0000 2013,@Matt_Sand Haha. See what I mean&gt;
300872172119941100,Mon Feb 11 07:41:30 +0000 2013,@theiBlog You don’t like it?
300872121456943100,Mon Feb 11 07:41:18 +0000 2013,@Matt_Sand Yeah, I have like 700,000 behind me. I bet a lot will just decide not to wait.
300871618090135550,Mon Feb 11 07:39:18 +0000 2013,@Matt_Sand That should drop pretty quickly. I think I had about 50,000 in front on Friday, and it appears to be going down fast today.

299424734049882100,Thu Feb 07 07:49:54 +0000 2013,@theiBlog There is a workaround, I believe. I very briefly looked into it earlier this week. I think it’s complicated, though.

297396148115738600,Fri Feb 01 17:29:01 +0000 2013,@TakeoWT how BlackBerry will convince them to sign up.
297396067824193540,Fri Feb 01 17:28:42 +0000 2013,@TakeoWT Possibly. I know there are some big apps coming, like Skype and WhatsApp. But it needs companies like Google on board. I don’t know
297395543980797950,Fri Feb 01 17:26:37 +0000 2013,@TakeoWT It’s a shame. BB10 is really promising, and the Z10’s a nice device. But apps is a massive problem.

297312552097046500,Fri Feb 01 11:56:50 +0000 2013,@CraigGrannell I think that is it. I don’t see why Apple would turn its back on the Mac Pro in Europe if it wasn’t going to kill it.
