822986121265213400,Sun Jan 22 01:55:56 +0000 2017,(13) Opposition &amp; resistance are more powerful (&amp; legitimate) when we separate the legitimacy of his WIN from illegitimacy of his VALUES.

822982576793157600,Sun Jan 22 01:41:51 +0000 2017,(9) Women, like men, are beautifully imperfect. We fart, burp, have good &amp; bad ideas, are generous &amp; stingy, &amp; are bundle of contradictions.
822979952693964800,Sun Jan 22 01:31:25 +0000 2017,(8) To say that "women are perfect," is almost as dangerous as saying women are unequal. And puts us in a dangerous (&amp; false) trap.
