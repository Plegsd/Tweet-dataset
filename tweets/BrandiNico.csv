915420849569542100,Wed Oct 04 03:38:32 +0000 2017,It is hard for White people to enter this sort of anti-racist model, because it costs power, privilege, and dominance at every level
915420657407557600,Wed Oct 04 03:37:47 +0000 2017,Christians must choose into a model that is less emotive and individualist and more concerned with the systemic corporate.

915419940697473000,Wed Oct 04 03:34:56 +0000 2017,Racial reconciliation is a cheapening of Jesus' reconciling work that is inherently about systems and whole people groups being redeemed.

915419081192308700,Wed Oct 04 03:31:31 +0000 2017,Racial rec isn't good for POC. It produces a theology that almost always centers right feeling over repentant right living.
915418749322199000,Wed Oct 04 03:30:12 +0000 2017,Racial reconciliation is an outdated model to pursue racial justice. It had its window, but now it serves to center and pander to Whiteness.
