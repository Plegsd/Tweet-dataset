421780282287480800,Fri Jan 10 23:07:10 +0000 2014,@Texiwill @jtroyer Practically, picking a platform depends on app requirements. But theoretical definition, not too sure.
421778349992579100,Fri Jan 10 22:59:29 +0000 2014,@Texiwill @jtroyer I would differ. It's vice-versa. The app definition depends on the platform. App does what a platform enables it to.
421776714763477000,Fri Jan 10 22:52:59 +0000 2014,@jtroyer @Texiwill Identity service would be SaaS and the vCHS load balancer should be IaaS I suppose. Sorry to barge in to the discussion.

421774999544815600,Fri Jan 10 22:46:10 +0000 2014,@Texiwill @jtroyer I suppose the definition will standardize once the technology itself standardizes. PaaS is still evolving. It's blurry.
