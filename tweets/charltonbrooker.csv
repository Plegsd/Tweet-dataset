430107479956267000,Sun Feb 02 22:36:28 +0000 2014,Why do we make five episodes followed by a comp? Because that's as many as we're paid to make.

407999427840704500,Tue Dec 03 22:26:58 +0000 2013,BTW, to clear up confusion, the titles were listed chronologically, not in order of merit. We cheated the chronology on the last one so ha.
407999104606666750,Tue Dec 03 22:25:41 +0000 2013,@Thom_Langley Tricky one but Doom's hard to beat.
407998996196495360,Tue Dec 03 22:25:15 +0000 2013,That's reminded me, there was a brief glimpse of Dark Souls in it too that had to go walkabouts due to time.
407998837450498050,Tue Dec 03 22:24:37 +0000 2013,@serafinowicz I've had a few quick goes at it, then thought "this looks like a time sponge" and have been too SCARED to return thus far.

406587266921152500,Sat Nov 30 00:55:33 +0000 2013,He also doesn't know a thing about videogames, which I'm trying to promote in advance of a television programme #scum

406582874918629400,Sat Nov 30 00:38:05 +0000 2013,For the record, he did not look "depressed and / or fat". He looked like a movie star playing Stewart Lee. Reckon he's had surgery too.

406581633769541600,Sat Nov 30 00:33:10 +0000 2013,To be clear, I love Stewart Lee and everything he does. But if he doesn't clear up this whole Addison Lee thing, he's fucking dead to me.

406128698719735800,Thu Nov 28 18:33:21 +0000 2013,I also fell for the old 'being interviewed while playing a game' scenario, which is like conducting a phonecall while spinning plates.

307142756571156500,Thu Feb 28 14:58:34 +0000 2013,... not that you ever do anything as prehistoric as watching television 'live', you button-jabbing gadfly.
307142374822383600,Thu Feb 28 14:57:03 +0000 2013,Anyway, point is, late NI scheduling means the show won't go up on the iPlayer till late. So you're best off actually watching it on TV...
307141845463490560,Thu Feb 28 14:54:57 +0000 2013,@Northern_Souled We call it an office. It's basically an inhabited skip.
307140623620784100,Thu Feb 28 14:50:05 +0000 2013,Why do the Northern Irish hate #WeeklyWipe so much they won't screen it at the SAME TIME as the REAL BBC2? Open weeping in the WW office.
307139812886986750,Thu Feb 28 14:46:52 +0000 2013,You know what's on BBC2 Northern Ireland IN MY ANOINTED SLOT? A 30-minute interview with James Nesbitt. Pretty Northern Irish, to be fair.
307139063843024900,Thu Feb 28 14:43:53 +0000 2013,... viewers in Norn Iron should be able to see it AT THE RIGHT TIME, WHICH IS TEN O' CLOCK by accessing the BBC HD channel.
307138750973108200,Thu Feb 28 14:42:39 +0000 2013,By the way, because #WeeklyWipe is broadcast an hour later in Northern Ireland, it takes ages for them to put it on the iPlayer...
307137506397278200,Thu Feb 28 14:37:42 +0000 2013,@DeborahFW Oh yeah, loads of people would visit it. Loads. It wouldn't need the weight of a paper behind it.
307137179006668800,Thu Feb 28 14:36:24 +0000 2013,@strickers66 The emphasis on 'sharing' and 'social' bullshit made me hate the PS4 intensely. Also, almost all the games looked v v v dull.

306151696860581900,Mon Feb 25 21:20:27 +0000 2013,Last #BlackMirror is on C4 at 10. Not a scary one this time, unless you're terrified by blue cartoon bears, in which case it's terrifying.
305993080694255600,Mon Feb 25 10:50:10 +0000 2013,Tonight's final #BlackMirror (C4, 10pm) is set in a mad fantasy world where people trust cartoon characters slightly more than politicians.

304710832292495360,Thu Feb 21 21:54:58 +0000 2013,Oh right, looks like Northern Ireland viewers who get the BBC HD channel can enter 'cheat mode' and watch the show at 10 after all.
