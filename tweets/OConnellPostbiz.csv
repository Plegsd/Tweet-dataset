1040411798292324400,Fri Sep 14 01:27:57 +0000 2018,I’m not tweeting everything by any means but there has not been a question about how much Bezos pays Amazon workers or how they are treated.
1040409048422776800,Fri Sep 14 01:17:01 +0000 2018,For three months at the beginning Amazon was called “Cadabra” as in abra cadabra. Sounded like ‘cadaver’ tho.
1040405754262511600,Fri Sep 14 01:03:56 +0000 2018,Bezos said he has had a couple of conversations with Trump. No details.
1040405377098174500,Fri Sep 14 01:02:26 +0000 2018,Bezos: “It is a mistake for any elected official...to attack media or journalists.” (Amazon beat reporters feel free to chime in here)
1040404926512472000,Fri Sep 14 01:00:38 +0000 2018,Graham asked for $250 million, Bezos said yes. No negotiations.

1040403555599962100,Fri Sep 14 00:55:12 +0000 2018,“We have made tremendous progress...we will get there.” No HQ2 news there.
1040403370815774700,Fri Sep 14 00:54:28 +0000 2018,HQ2 mention. Room of business people cheering
1040402995173830700,Fri Sep 14 00:52:58 +0000 2018,Bezos will create a nonprofit that will run the preschools he is funding. He will be running a national network of Montessori preschools.
