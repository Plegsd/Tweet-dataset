834583097614225400,Thu Feb 23 01:58:10 +0000 2017,@Cp6_CTPAX This isn't a skin. It's a highly technical custom paint process. Skins can't cover a product like this.

834527793027354600,Wed Feb 22 22:18:25 +0000 2017,@yoeph_ They can't be disassembled so precision maskings and paint tolerances are required. Need to be applied under a microscope.
