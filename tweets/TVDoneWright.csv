263309703432515600,Tue Oct 30 16:01:40 +0000 2012,Dear fellow media: Before posting a #Community to Canada story, how about a little research. This won't happen without NBC premiere date.

263307710764830720,Tue Oct 30 15:53:44 +0000 2012,@vulture I wouldn't hold that for truth. City TV often pulls their schedule last minute to follow the US. I don't see them going without NBC

259825465634738180,Sun Oct 21 01:16:32 +0000 2012,Cragan is mad that they let her off with Manslaughter 2 .  And there is where #SVU300 will enter in, I imagine. #SVUPilot

259823119076831230,Sun Oct 21 01:07:13 +0000 2012,They really get into Benson's backstory fast. Right in there in the pilot. You rarely see it that fast anymore. #SVUPilot

259822611729625100,Sun Oct 21 01:05:12 +0000 2012,Olivia Benson's mother  make an appearance. She has a glass of wine. So does Liv. #SVUPilot
259822297244921860,Sun Oct 21 01:03:57 +0000 2012,It's amazing that they used the same actress for Stabler's wife the whole time.  #SVUPilot
259821942067048450,Sun Oct 21 01:02:32 +0000 2012,Side note:  I mixed Mountain Dew, Five-Alive Juice, and Gold Rum.  I might be a genius...or  a mad scientist.
259820336734937100,Sun Oct 21 00:56:10 +0000 2012,Victim turns out to be a rapist. Interesting that Cragan uses that case to see if Benson has what it takes. #SVUPilot

259815980329488400,Sun Oct 21 00:38:51 +0000 2012,Elliot Stabler had FOUR kids in the pilot. #SVUPilot

259736072710410240,Sat Oct 20 19:21:20 +0000 2012,Chevy Chase had another outburst on the set of #Community because he feels that Piers is becoming TOO racist . Sounds like a valid point.

222823175354986500,Tue Jul 10 22:42:39 +0000 2012,@corybarker Not defending the joke, but as someone who goes to a show, you should KNOW who you go see/his material and style.
222822375396343800,Tue Jul 10 22:39:28 +0000 2012,It's a sad day when a stand-up comedian has to apologize to a heckler (someone who yells at him on stage during performance). #TeamTosh
