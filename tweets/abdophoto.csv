912514729213550600,Tue Sep 26 03:10:39 +0000 2017,5/ The iPhone X certainly has a 5.8-inch display, but that size is deceiving in my opinion. I would have preferred a Plus with no bezels.
912514547382075400,Tue Sep 26 03:09:56 +0000 2017,@martinmoorejr It’s larger sure, but it’s deceiving.
912514424740626400,Tue Sep 26 03:09:27 +0000 2017,4/ Instead, what you get is a device that makes it harder to reach Notification and Control Center and you just scroll a *little* bit less.
912514173485015000,Tue Sep 26 03:08:27 +0000 2017,3/ For example, with Plus you get bigger images, bigger maps, bigger video, bigger keyboard. All those are smaller on iPhone X.
912514024889135100,Tue Sep 26 03:07:51 +0000 2017,2/ With iPhone X, you’re basically getting a taller iPhone 7/8, which means all the benefits of the Plus are not really there.

902569309662097400,Tue Aug 29 16:31:07 +0000 2017,If Apple isn’t going to create a physical TV, then I’d argue they should go the CarPlay model an work with TV makers to have ATV software.
902568810401603600,Tue Aug 29 16:29:07 +0000 2017,The future of TV is not a box attached to your television. https://t.co/10oRrqmjKu

902567819618902000,Tue Aug 29 16:25:11 +0000 2017,@jcenters LOL. If Apple had put effort into gaming, for example, then you could argue the ATV warrants upgrades. But they haven’t.

902567163122171900,Tue Aug 29 16:22:35 +0000 2017,@jcenters As I said, imagine ProMotion on ATV that auto changes refresh rates and color settings based on content. Movies vs Sports.
902566951620247600,Tue Aug 29 16:21:44 +0000 2017,@jcenters My argument is like, if it costs $3K-$4K for an OLED, why not have some cool innovations in it. Apple can do that.
902566696526872600,Tue Aug 29 16:20:43 +0000 2017,@jcenters And this is why I keep arguing for Apple to make their own television. Bring iPad innovations, FaceTime, audio, a physical TV.

902565851978653700,Tue Aug 29 16:17:22 +0000 2017,The only good thing that might come out of a 4K Apple TV is that the current 1080P Apple TV gets a significant price drop.
902565654640734200,Tue Aug 29 16:16:35 +0000 2017,@jcenters Agreed. This is why ATV strategy makes little sense to me. 4K is not a reason to upgrade for 99% of people IMO.

885596259045724200,Thu Jul 13 20:26:16 +0000 2017,I keep saying it. A total hands-free option to controlling your TV is something lots of us would love. https://t.co/r41tHtzmbR

884241935753297900,Mon Jul 10 02:44:40 +0000 2017,5/ That, to me, is the bigger issue than price. If Apple is pricing iPhone Pro because of demand, I don’t think $1200 -$1300 is enough.
884241701237170200,Mon Jul 10 02:43:44 +0000 2017,4/ How many people who were going to spend $900+ anyways are going to say “Oh, I’ll just get the 7s instead” because Pro isn’t available?
