585291319234428900,Tue Apr 07 04:01:39 +0000 2015,@ccccory Absolutely. I’ll probably do separate videos covering it for Sass and Stylus at least.
585286359092334600,Tue Apr 07 03:41:56 +0000 2015,@ccccory Not yet! Stylus videos are usually on Thursdays for me. I planned on doing the Lost videos then. Should I wait?

582997511826108400,Tue Mar 31 20:06:53 +0000 2015,@ccccory Is this something that should be added to every Lost grid?
582997411343122400,Tue Mar 31 20:06:29 +0000 2015,@ccccory I noticed that your Lost grid example has   overflow-x: hidden on the html element to fix widths from box()

581975492175077400,Sun Mar 29 00:25:44 +0000 2015,@ccccory Good idea. I was planning to do a series on Jeet, but covering Lost instead sounds like a great idea. Looks really great!!
581973516221722600,Sun Mar 29 00:17:53 +0000 2015,If you have contacted Level Up in the past couple of months. I may not have been received. Working on recovering those contact submissions.
581486907101732900,Fri Mar 27 16:04:16 +0000 2015,@lan3jur I don’t mind Angular 2 at all and plan on doing a series on that once it’s more complete. aurelia.io is def also on my list
581486633846968300,Fri Mar 27 16:03:11 +0000 2015,@lan3jur Yes. I think there is still a large demand Angular 1.x tutorials that are clear and aimed at beginners-&gt;advanced.
