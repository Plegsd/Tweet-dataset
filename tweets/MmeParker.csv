483833798933884900,Tue Jul 01 04:45:41 +0000 2014,#VirginAustralia know how to #servicefail. Overcharge them by $3k, make the customer chase the money, take 4 wks to refund -no apology.
483803250559164400,Tue Jul 01 02:44:18 +0000 2014,@VirginAustralia sure will DM. But was already escalated to accounts team - twice...
483780942486466560,Tue Jul 01 01:15:39 +0000 2014,@VirginAustralia spoken to call centre twice, Facebook once, airport once - surely that's enough?
483776593202913300,Tue Jul 01 00:58:22 +0000 2014,@VirginAustralia you overcharged me $3k and haven't been able to fix it in 3 weeks?? #poorservice
450557424030605300,Mon Mar 31 08:57:15 +0000 2014,@margiewarrell great commentary on #abcnews tonight advocating for resilience in our kids and not wrapping our #AFL Juniors in cotton wool.

393531610097659900,Fri Oct 25 00:17:01 +0000 2013,My new @gucci belt split on first wear. None left in the world to replace and am waiting for 'authority' for a refund. #poorservice

382414848417493000,Tue Sep 24 08:02:59 +0000 2013,@Optus Jules and Tom thank you for sorting out my email issue that has been bothering me for more than 12 months #greatservice
382373200736165900,Tue Sep 24 05:17:29 +0000 2013,@Optus Tom - it's always been an issue. Just been living with it and waiting to send emails when connected to home wifi.
382370134477656060,Tue Sep 24 05:05:18 +0000 2013,@Optus Tom yes the issue is with sending optus mail (not receiving) on iPhone and iPad not through the web version.
382343083355938800,Tue Sep 24 03:17:49 +0000 2013,Help @Optus my webmail only receives email and never sends unless I'm on home wifi. Changed settings but no luck. Advice?
