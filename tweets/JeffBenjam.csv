793827090563002400,Wed Nov 02 14:48:21 +0000 2016,I change my mind about blaming Apple for the SD Card predicament. We should be blaming Sony, Panasonic, etc. https://t.co/25B7ni4Vqs
793812442149167100,Wed Nov 02 13:50:09 +0000 2016,@VermontNerd Yeah, no one wants to ask Siri to change the volume. Although you can simply take them out of your ears as an option I guess.
793674584709005300,Wed Nov 02 04:42:21 +0000 2016,@StevenSandhoff @marcoarment Blackmagic has great ideas. Why are cameras still using slow sub-3.x USB? I‚Äôll never understand.
793673932343763000,Wed Nov 02 04:39:45 +0000 2016,@marcoarment lol at anyone suggesting that. Not only is it slow, but horrifically unreliable and clunky. Especially on Sony.
793673525508923400,Wed Nov 02 04:38:08 +0000 2016,@marcoarment the most painful thing is the lack of an SD Card reader. Such an instrumental tool for creatives of all kinds. üòû
793661124101206000,Wed Nov 02 03:48:52 +0000 2016,@JGfromOC mainly interested in the continuum windows 10 stuff. But I probably need another peripheral for that it appears?
793660280010051600,Wed Nov 02 03:45:30 +0000 2016,@Rayg350 @iAm_erica I‚Äôd go with the base Pro tbh. Cheaper than the mb configured how I‚Äôd recommend. Maybe @iAm_erica has a different pov.
793608749856485400,Wed Nov 02 00:20:45 +0000 2016,@SnazzyQ Add in the fact that USB-C docks/adapters can‚Äôt push a 4K signal via HDMI, even if it‚Äôs HDMI 2.0. :P
793594859542249500,Tue Nov 01 23:25:33 +0000 2016,@DetroitBORG Would you consider using it indoors in ‚Äútripod‚Äù mode on a regular basis?
793587345308213200,Tue Nov 01 22:55:41 +0000 2016,@JGfromOC must admit, that looks cool.
793573832518934500,Tue Nov 01 22:02:00 +0000 2016,@SaulBHP Thanks for watching/reading.
793573802940723200,Tue Nov 01 22:01:53 +0000 2016,@SaulBHP I will, look for another installment this Friday.
793508669048627200,Tue Nov 01 17:43:04 +0000 2016,@VermontNerd one can hope.
793505012597059600,Tue Nov 01 17:28:32 +0000 2016,@MKBHD That post processing panning and zooming ability while being able to retain 4K is üòç

793214783587835900,Mon Oct 31 22:15:16 +0000 2016,@calafrican0 I‚Äôd like to try it.
793213952520032300,Mon Oct 31 22:11:58 +0000 2016,@mattbirchler yeah it‚Äôll take a while. Forgot how much I missed a larger screen tho. I can deal with Jet fans tbh.

793209718248538100,Mon Oct 31 21:55:08 +0000 2016,I just heard fans fire up on a MacBook Pro for the first time in six months. Startling. Not sure if I want to go back to that.
793183594386714600,Mon Oct 31 20:11:20 +0000 2016,@CraftyDeano I‚Äôm using an HDMI 2.0 compliant adapter as well. :(
793183408025374700,Mon Oct 31 20:10:35 +0000 2016,@CraftyDeano I don‚Äôt get this. Bandwidth shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. But Yeah, tested like 4 adapters and no dice. Maybe a FW update is needed.
793162435930759200,Mon Oct 31 18:47:15 +0000 2016,Well hello there. https://t.co/itfvox8tFS
793159583883812900,Mon Oct 31 18:35:55 +0000 2016,@chrisatzinger But you do sacrifice a little bit of portability.
793159189858226200,Mon Oct 31 18:34:21 +0000 2016,@chrisatzinger Hmmm, TBH I‚Äôd swap it for the Pro.
793157988420837400,Mon Oct 31 18:29:35 +0000 2016,@chrisatzinger Depends on your needs. What will you be using it for?
793145742923796500,Mon Oct 31 17:40:55 +0000 2016,@marco_viscito I‚Äôm considering it.

792901460220645400,Mon Oct 31 01:30:14 +0000 2016,@mhafez that‚Äôs a good one. Should work fine at 60hz
792847860006019100,Sun Oct 30 21:57:14 +0000 2016,@Dugdale I don‚Äôt think any objective Mac owner would deny that this machine is impressive. Very niche, but nonetheless impressive.
792794024683905000,Sun Oct 30 18:23:19 +0000 2016,There are lots of reasons why I use a Mac, but having access to Final Cut Pro X is definitely near the top of the l‚Ä¶ https://t.co/AEKHn9f8gR
792384129056800800,Sat Oct 29 15:14:32 +0000 2016,@tomas_villegas @9to5mac weird. I export with compressor settings. Not home now so I can‚Äôt check. I‚Äôll get with u later.
792145544525279200,Fri Oct 28 23:26:29 +0000 2016,@jdlien yep
792138598103523300,Fri Oct 28 22:58:53 +0000 2016,All I hear is jokes about dongles, but these people are selling TB3 short. 1 cable will be able to do a lot in a desktop environment.
792138272390705200,Fri Oct 28 22:57:36 +0000 2016,@superscientific I would like to think that there will be no limits, especially with NVIDIA web drivers.
792137803601743900,Fri Oct 28 22:55:44 +0000 2016,If anything, the new MacBook Pro is the most enthusiast-oriented Mac in recent times. eGPUs, people.
792031293575950300,Fri Oct 28 15:52:30 +0000 2016,@patfan198010 Should be able to.

791734655234011100,Thu Oct 27 20:13:46 +0000 2016,@CraftyDeano I‚Äôd say definitely so. TB3 supports 2 4K displays simultaneously at 60 Hz. One should be no issue.
