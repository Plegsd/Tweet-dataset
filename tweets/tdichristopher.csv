759946907192090600,Mon Aug 01 03:00:36 +0000 2016,@jlangdale I see we've arrived back at where we've started. Which seems like as good a place as any to agree to disagree.
759945980145958900,Mon Aug 01 02:56:55 +0000 2016,@jlangdale I mean, sure. Future emails could show Todd is Batman. But until released, I'm not going to speculate he's the Dark Knight
759945594496512000,Mon Aug 01 02:55:23 +0000 2016,@jlangdale And why hold back emails with a smoking gun?
759945513802338300,Mon Aug 01 02:55:04 +0000 2016,@jlangdale I'm really trying to understand. But if the first emails released showed nothing untoward, why would ones yet to be released?
759944990256758800,Mon Aug 01 02:52:59 +0000 2016,@jlangdale Of course there's contact b/w political dir of a news agency &amp; DNC. How do you think journalists get info? It's called reporting.
759943962509574100,Mon Aug 01 02:48:54 +0000 2016,@jlangdale But let's be straight. This is something you think, not something you know.
759943325973708800,Mon Aug 01 02:46:22 +0000 2016,@jlangdale So you've seen them?
759943199767035900,Mon Aug 01 02:45:52 +0000 2016,@jlangdale So you know for a fact these emails exist?
759942922708082700,Mon Aug 01 02:44:46 +0000 2016,@jlangdale ... We're not allowed to slander someone in public just because a hypothetical conspiracy is more interesting than the facts.
759942841942638600,Mon Aug 01 02:44:27 +0000 2016,@jlangdale This is the difference between journalists and internet trolls...
759942298578935800,Mon Aug 01 02:42:17 +0000 2016,@jlangdale so you're speculating that hypothetical emails exist to prove a connection b/w Todd &amp; DNC that the leaked ones don't show?
759929421793026000,Mon Aug 01 01:51:07 +0000 2016,@jlangdale more emails? Which ones are you referring to?
759921203842658300,Mon Aug 01 01:18:28 +0000 2016,@jlangdale Should he have just ignored DWS's email? Legit asking. I'm trying to understand what you would have done in his place.
759920919485620200,Mon Aug 01 01:17:20 +0000 2016,@jlangdale I just fail to see what about the outcome - DNC not getting what it wanted - suggests Todd was a DNC lackey.
759920693249060900,Mon Aug 01 01:16:26 +0000 2016,@jlangdale So DWS sends Todd an email about how she perceives an MSNBC anchor talks about her and it's Todd's fault she sent it?
759899997605400600,Sun Jul 31 23:54:12 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 Conclusion: DNC info is valuable for public discourse, but source's motive is potentially problematic.
759899746454634500,Sun Jul 31 23:53:12 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 That's why I think good journalism required Todd to ask Assange about the source of the info. Of course he won't answer it.
759899001839812600,Sun Jul 31 23:50:14 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 If it is proven @wikileaks got info from an adversarial state seeking to disrupt US elections, that raises ethical questions
759898703360585700,Sun Jul 31 23:49:03 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 But as a journalist, you must consider the motive of the source giving you info.
759898582824738800,Sun Jul 31 23:48:35 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 I think we agree DNC did something foolish and untoward. I'm not arguing against disclosing the emails.
759898282328002600,Sun Jul 31 23:47:23 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 Deep Throat was a whistleblower. That status is earned through intent. Not sure Russian intel would qualify as whistle blower.
759897612820570100,Sun Jul 31 23:44:43 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 Also, I'm confused, what "things" did I make up?
759897036854526000,Sun Jul 31 23:42:26 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 Multiple cyber security experts and US intel agencies say it's most likely Russia hacked DNC. Valid Q to ask Assange.
759896566744354800,Sun Jul 31 23:40:34 +0000 2016,@jlangdale Todd is the political director @ NBC news. Why wouldn't he be in touch with high-level political guests?
759832041202614300,Sun Jul 31 19:24:10 +0000 2016,@jlangdale Regardless, I think Todd's question today was important: Does the public have right to know where DNC WikiLeaks trove came from?
759831565648134100,Sun Jul 31 19:22:16 +0000 2016,@jlangdale Trying to see your POV, but your accusation seems to be based largely on speculation, not facts.
759830875945263100,Sun Jul 31 19:19:32 +0000 2016,@jlangdale Respect your opinion, but DWS didn't get what her staff asked for: for Joe&amp;Mia to cease criticism. So how does Todd work for DNC?
759826649311506400,Sun Jul 31 19:02:44 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 Acknowledging that does not dilute the value of the content @wikileaks releases. In fact, it makes the org more credible IMO.
759826359069839400,Sun Jul 31 19:01:35 +0000 2016,@SMasters0417 Also, journalists expected to disclose bias of sources. My opinion is  @wikileaks should be held to same standard.
