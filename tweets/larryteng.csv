645285129003229200,Sat Sep 19 17:15:38 +0000 2015,@rhyscoiro spitting and calling Briggs "a bad actor" were all adlibs that elevated the scene. #GracelandFinale
645284668460273700,Sat Sep 19 17:13:48 +0000 2015,@brandojay leaving the house with the money was the last scene he filmed during season three. Needless to say, emotional. #GracelandFinale

645283027619156000,Sat Sep 19 17:07:17 +0000 2015,Steadicam operator Mike McGowan earned his check in this scene. We probably did 8 takes and each take was 3 min long. #GracelandFinale
645282765965955100,Sat Sep 19 17:06:14 +0000 2015,As a director sometimes you gotta learn not to over do something... Briggs' "Tigers" speech was a well earned oner. #GracelandFinale

645281348756746200,Sat Sep 19 17:00:36 +0000 2015,@rhyscoiro had always said in passing he wanted to partake in a gunfight with Briggs. He got his wish! #GracelandFinale
645281206276198400,Sat Sep 19 17:00:02 +0000 2015,Dan Shattuck had asked me during Ep 307 what I wanted to do for the end of the year and I told him "A big ass gunfight" #GracelandFinale
645281041595306000,Sat Sep 19 16:59:23 +0000 2015,Shootout was filmed over the course of two long night :) #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV

645280191531515900,Sat Sep 19 16:56:01 +0000 2015,This shoot out... needless lots of bullets. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV
645280037587972100,Sat Sep 19 16:55:24 +0000 2015,Briggs' "man up" speech to Ari is exactly what he did this season when Logan back him into a corner. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV
645279380302753800,Sat Sep 19 16:52:47 +0000 2015,We shot one 8 minute take with four cameras for his haircutting sequence. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV
645279213298151400,Sat Sep 19 16:52:07 +0000 2015,This scene when @brandojay cuts his hair... one of the most powerful moments I've ever been a part of. 15 yrs of history in those locks.
645278996003876900,Sat Sep 19 16:51:16 +0000 2015,If you recall Jakes in Ep 309 "I want a million bucks and the love of a beautiful woman. Ain't in the cards." I guess it was.
645278178206855200,Sat Sep 19 16:48:01 +0000 2015,Obviously this shot of @DanielGRACELAND clean shaven was his last shot of season three. #GracelandFinale
645277733006651400,Sat Sep 19 16:46:14 +0000 2015,Jakes' flashback was originally scripted as a monologue but I asked Dan and Jeff if I could actually shoot it. #GracelandFinale
645277293942693900,Sat Sep 19 16:44:30 +0000 2015,"Retrospective Falsification" was the original name of the episode until Dan Shattuck wrote the "No Old Tigers" speech. #GracelandFinale
645276837078110200,Sat Sep 19 16:42:41 +0000 2015,The showdown in the house was one of my favorite scenes from this season. Kudos to Dan Shattuck for writing this epic scene #GracelandFinale
645276490985160700,Sat Sep 19 16:41:18 +0000 2015,Great scene b/t Briggs and Jakes... really leans into how alone Briggs has been on this journey. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV
645275657023320000,Sat Sep 19 16:37:59 +0000 2015,Apparently the Toby story that @AnnieIlonzeh is telling really happened to writer Dan Shattuck. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV
645275493474807800,Sat Sep 19 16:37:20 +0000 2015,The hotel we used was @1HotelSB ... an amazing space. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV

645274970717683700,Sat Sep 19 16:35:16 +0000 2015,Episodes 311, 312 &amp; 313 were all shot simultaneously. Wasn't easy but it allowed us to get the scope we wanted #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV
645274480596512800,Sat Sep 19 16:33:19 +0000 2015,Everytime Logan threw the binder, it would fall apart so we had a 2nd binder on the floor that @DanielGRACELAND picked up. #GracelandFinale
645274116602269700,Sat Sep 19 16:31:52 +0000 2015,Overhead spinning shot over Logan's desk was a tricky one... took two dolly grips and 7 takes to get right. #GracelandFinale @GracelandTV

531492326636412900,Sun Nov 09 17:03:39 +0000 2014,I gave @Mark_Dacascos the note to be super casual as he drops the "our mother" bit. He's dusting his pants off LOL #H50100
531492144385499140,Sun Nov 09 17:02:56 +0000 2014,We worked hard on McG's reaction to Wo Fat's "our mother"... had to make sure we were gauging everything properly so it tracked in the ep
531491889669615600,Sun Nov 09 17:01:55 +0000 2014,@Tashirasbubble Extremely. Even though its fake, its still H2O and you still get some in your mouth. Dangerous but important it looked real
531491615471202300,Sun Nov 09 17:00:50 +0000 2014,If you look closely, Alex is wearing special dilated contact lenses for the drug effect. That was his idea :) #H50100
531491436194041860,Sun Nov 09 17:00:07 +0000 2014,Because of the size, it was important to be able to light the set practically so there were no lights inside the set. #H50100
531491081901199360,Sun Nov 09 16:58:43 +0000 2014,@Terrysagirl Yes. No stunts there.
531491020370747400,Sun Nov 09 16:58:28 +0000 2014,Kono and Adam scene was the last scene shot for the episode. #H50100
531490742665875460,Sun Nov 09 16:57:22 +0000 2014,Waterboarding scenes I used my experience from shooting #CriminalMinds episode 200. Just some saranwrap inside the towel.
531490516378996740,Sun Nov 09 16:56:28 +0000 2014,Lens skipping was something I learned from Michael Cuesta, who shot the pilots for #ELEMENTARY, #BLUEBLOODS and #HOMELAND. #H50100
531490516378996740,Sun Nov 09 16:56:28 +0000 2014,Lens skipping was something I learned from Michael Cuesta, who shot the pilots for #ELEMENTARY, #BLUEBLOODS and #HOMELAND. #H50100
531489937959301100,Sun Nov 09 16:54:10 +0000 2014,Also shot much of the interrogation room scenes together for the same reason, to help Alex's perf. It was exhausting but worth it #H50100
531489632341348350,Sun Nov 09 16:52:57 +0000 2014,Again we shot Wo Fat's entrance out of focus on purpose, until he walked forward. #H50100

531489345924907000,Sun Nov 09 16:51:49 +0000 2014,The hospital was one of the few handheld scenes shot in this episode #H50100
531489034640429060,Sun Nov 09 16:50:35 +0000 2014,Scotty was incredible in this hospital scene. A wide range of choices some more sadistic than others. "Bono" was another adlib #H50100
531488752418320400,Sun Nov 09 16:49:27 +0000 2014,Not gonna lie, watched a bunch of CoverGirl commercials on YouTube for the Surf Kiss vid #H50100
531488465163022340,Sun Nov 09 16:48:19 +0000 2014,I was adamant in prep that we shoot the car scenes on the streets and not rear projection. It was important to have them look like the pilot
531488315942252540,Sun Nov 09 16:47:43 +0000 2014,And my first time working with Hurley, I mean Jorge #H50100
531488162602680300,Sun Nov 09 16:47:07 +0000 2014,Sometimes you get that perfect take when the piece of food hits her face and stays there :) #H50100
531488030394052600,Sun Nov 09 16:46:35 +0000 2014,Shot "drugged up" POV's for virtually every scene McG was in to always be able to tell the story subjectively from his POV #H50100
531487824181071900,Sun Nov 09 16:45:46 +0000 2014,Spent time talking about the significance and impact of McG and Daddy McG's hug #H50100
531487665762222100,Sun Nov 09 16:45:08 +0000 2014,Scotty's adlib "Isn't that right Duke?" #H50100
531487535680086000,Sun Nov 09 16:44:37 +0000 2014,A lot of funny outtake with Chi and Dennis Chun for this bit... #H50100
531487230414430200,Sun Nov 09 16:43:24 +0000 2014,A lot of the lens skipping was done in camera when we shot with a loose lens techniques. It was then augmented by the editor in post.#H50100
531487088470810600,Sun Nov 09 16:42:51 +0000 2014,I didn't show Alex the home movie until we rolled the closeup to get the purest reax possible. #H50100
531486560651194400,Sun Nov 09 16:40:45 +0000 2014,White room scenes were shot continuously so Alex could get a better arc for his perf. #H50100
531486131133497340,Sun Nov 09 16:39:02 +0000 2014,And the first time working with Chi... man, it was an episode of firsts... #H50100
531486013239988200,Sun Nov 09 16:38:34 +0000 2014,When we shot @GavinRossdale coverage in the warehouse, the sun had gone down! It was pitch black outside. Kudos to the DP... #H50100
531485764912042000,Sun Nov 09 16:37:35 +0000 2014,Fun fact: @GavinRossdale and I are classroom dads together. #H50100

531485324501725200,Sun Nov 09 16:35:50 +0000 2014,White room set and the interrogation set were built by the awesome Keith Neely and his art team. #H50100
531485170067439600,Sun Nov 09 16:35:13 +0000 2014,The spinning eyeball shot was one of the first shots I had planned out when I got this script. Excellent execution by the crew #H50100
531484942086074400,Sun Nov 09 16:34:19 +0000 2014,We shot the CU of McG talking to Dad on the phone right in the #H50 stage parking lot ;)
531484467416670200,Sun Nov 09 16:32:26 +0000 2014,Believe it or not, my first time working with the great Bill Sadler... #H50100
531484203213258750,Sun Nov 09 16:31:23 +0000 2014,Here we go... it was fun studying the pilot and watching this opening sequence again. #H50100
