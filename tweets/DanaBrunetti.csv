849447907652767700,Wed Apr 05 02:25:37 +0000 2017,@NickGuthe @realDonaldTrump FAKE NEWS
849431260913184800,Wed Apr 05 01:19:28 +0000 2017,(11) UNLESS @AlecBaldwin saw @KevinSpacey some event after and yelled at him?? Though that would be wrong too, because again, Alec knew.
849430808968523800,Wed Apr 05 01:17:41 +0000 2017,(10) So to summarize, @AlecBaldwin knew NikkiReed_I_Am was 16, didn't find out AFTER filming, and did not yell at us.
849430016010186800,Wed Apr 05 01:14:32 +0000 2017,(9) however to say that when he found out after filming he yelled at the producers (I being 1 on the film) makes it out to seem we did wrong
849429430057410600,Wed Apr 05 01:12:12 +0000 2017,(8) if @AlecBaldwin had simply said in his book he didn't know @NikkiReed_I_Am's age, I would let it go.
849429041119727600,Wed Apr 05 01:10:39 +0000 2017,(7) And I have just received 3 other message from crew and other producer stating that he knew how old @NikkiReed_I_Am was during filming.
849425239222210600,Wed Apr 05 00:55:33 +0000 2017,(6) but to @AlecBaldwin's benefit, he has been impersonating Trump a lot, so maybe there was a bit of method acting when writing his book?
849424529399087100,Wed Apr 05 00:52:44 +0000 2017,(5) continued... "which was a real issue with the subject matter and the rather unusual cast of character we were dealing with."
849424282291720200,Wed Apr 05 00:51:45 +0000 2017,(4) The films director @NickGuthe said "We liked the idea that b/c it meant we couldn't be pressured into shooting scenes w/nudity"
849423303089549300,Wed Apr 05 00:47:51 +0000 2017,(3) the only time @AlecBaldwin ever yelled at me was on the phone and it was about one of the producers who worked with the financier.
849422874519756800,Wed Apr 05 00:46:09 +0000 2017,(2) in fact @NikkiReed_I_Am was 1 of 4 actresses @AlecBaldwin had approved and her being the only 1 of those 4 repped by HIS own agency CAA.
849422487133737000,Wed Apr 05 00:44:37 +0000 2017,(1) My first indie film was Mini's starring @AlecBaldwin who knew @NikkiReed_I_Am was 16 (not 17) and he didn't mind https://t.co/aZ3KyeIiyC

773970401751957500,Thu Sep 08 19:44:58 +0000 2016,@E_L_James @iguestinfo well, well. Look who it is.
773970323221995500,Thu Sep 08 19:44:39 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes we on the same flt? Are you in the back of the Relativity jet? I brought about 200 people w/me so don't remember who I invited
773969353998004200,Thu Sep 08 19:40:48 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes @IndiegogoFilm @horizonaward we can discuss. I have strong feelings about how these things work as you know.
773969202759761900,Thu Sep 08 19:40:12 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes let's chat in Toronto (assuming you're there). Cassian, the great negotiator who knows how to deal with all kinds of crazy.
773968862681436200,Thu Sep 08 19:38:51 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes let me know and I'll try to turn you on to some who can help.
773967797961490400,Thu Sep 08 19:34:37 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes if you're putting up your name and $ and they're still charging, IMO  @theblcklst is exploiting you as well.
773967521326174200,Thu Sep 08 19:33:31 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes and to be clear, I think you're one of the best producers out there for many reasons, thus my disappointment of them charging.
773966449954132000,Thu Sep 08 19:29:15 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes as you know I've done it since 2002 and never once was a dime charged to any who benefited.
773966170336682000,Thu Sep 08 19:28:09 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes happy to as long as entrants aren't being charged. I will not support that type of exploitation.
773965643125227500,Thu Sep 08 19:26:03 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes @theblcklst charging anything is explotive. Get a sponsor and don't charge.
773965173304549400,Thu Sep 08 19:24:11 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes thus is why I'm blowing this up. If @theblcklst is charging for access to what you're doing they're in the wrong IMO.
773964984623784000,Thu Sep 08 19:23:26 +0000 2016,@cassianelwes can you be absolutely clear then that is cost nothing for writers to enter this via @theblcklst?

773952467138670600,Thu Sep 08 18:33:42 +0000 2016,@TheOriginalHoff haha. Paying them to read for companies that actually produce, yes. Charging aspiring undiscovered writers, no.
