580513397957111800,Tue Mar 24 23:35:54 +0000 2015,3/6. Dont forget that in the end, each "commercial" self standing startup needs to generate revenue, unless u r a feature.
580513332014264300,Tue Mar 24 23:35:38 +0000 2015,2/6.2. Agree that entrepreneurs should want to make a difference, initiate fundamental change.
580513257074614300,Tue Mar 24 23:35:20 +0000 2015,Feeling brave  -  longer tweetstorm - 1/6. Popular myth that focussing on revenue defocusses startups.
580512593858719700,Tue Mar 24 23:32:42 +0000 2015,@frzndgoash You can ask for anything - the worst is someone says no. Q is - can you make someone believe that they should support you.
580510913104621600,Tue Mar 24 23:26:01 +0000 2015,3/3 high valuations - low price of risk/execution - important to be able to stay in for the long term - conviction and right entrepreneur.
580510573290500100,Tue Mar 24 23:24:40 +0000 2015,2/3 Execution not being priced in - going from concept, to company requires execution and scale.
580510353139851300,Tue Mar 24 23:23:48 +0000 2015,1/3 Market pricing risk 2 cheaply - good outcome - lots of entrepreneurial activity, challenge - will need many pivots, and some crashes.
