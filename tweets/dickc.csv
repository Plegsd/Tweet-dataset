644485495796432900,Thu Sep 17 12:18:10 +0000 2015,@johnbattelle there's a fine line between exhilarating and frightening, and 125mph in a sedan is right about the spot.

643648199652053000,Tue Sep 15 04:51:03 +0000 2015,@ashleymayer such a cute dog. Adorable.
643647945594671100,Tue Sep 15 04:50:03 +0000 2015,@richeisen surprising given the turnover. That's a lot of talent to replace. Offensive coordinator doing a great job; Vikes on their heels.
