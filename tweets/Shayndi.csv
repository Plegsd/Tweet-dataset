747864958021541900,Tue Jun 28 18:51:15 +0000 2016,@SohrabAhmari @davidharsanyi Your ignorance is showing. Judaism is a rabbinic religion. The way the rabbis interpret the Torah is the law.
747864816979677200,Tue Jun 28 18:50:41 +0000 2016,@SohrabAhmari @davidharsanyi @ADL_National  My contention is rabbinic interpretation trumps pshat of Torah. Rabbinics = Judaism.

747861152420499500,Tue Jun 28 18:36:07 +0000 2016,@SohrabAhmari @davidharsanyi Rabbinic law permits abortion in certain cases, including psychological harm to mother.
