181280874694844400,Sun Mar 18 07:28:23 +0000 2012,My roommate's trying to be Vani Jayaram. Fair enough, I'm trying to be Nigella.
181280637167210500,Sun Mar 18 07:27:26 +0000 2012,Tried to recollect a dream involving doctors, Maldonado, and Disney characters. Realized that those were tweets I'd seen, not dreams.

180166649696092160,Thu Mar 15 05:40:51 +0000 2012,... Then again if I owned Snapdeal, maybe I'd say chindi chors, jo hai, so hai, you'll come and buy anyway.
180166549435457540,Thu Mar 15 05:40:27 +0000 2012,If I owned Snapdeal, the website would have better category navigation, and the mailers would be customized to spend history.
179872424140091400,Wed Mar 14 10:11:42 +0000 2012,Aman Sethi, Katherine Boo, the obligatory Archer, and a bunch of non-fiction. Good haul.

179624214167429120,Tue Mar 13 17:45:24 +0000 2012,Why would anyone choose Croma over Flipkart? Croma has no home delivery, untrained sales reps, and parts of your order not packed in.
179616462162497540,Tue Mar 13 17:14:36 +0000 2012,@techrsr Ah no wonder.

178857900691828740,Sun Mar 11 15:00:21 +0000 2012,@bhuto Absolutely. Supposedly there are hotels which advertise themselves as being internet-free. Clever marketing, that.
178857655908044800,Sun Mar 11 14:59:22 +0000 2012,@knittins I think I tweeted it as a heads up that you won't find me on Twitter as often, actually :) @techrsr

177243252464951300,Wed Mar 07 04:04:19 +0000 2012,@hamsiniravi Maybe the new generation of parents won't hold themselves up to the standards our parents set for themselves?

177240691179667460,Wed Mar 07 03:54:08 +0000 2012,@i_r_squared Wha? Knowing me is knowing I'm not pregnant? GMAT level logical reasoning of highest order @krtgrphr

177239958925488130,Wed Mar 07 03:51:13 +0000 2012,... And no this is not some big lead up to say I'm pregnant. The good news is ALWAYS that I'm not. @krtgrphr
177239791228817400,Wed Mar 07 03:50:33 +0000 2012,@krtgrphr I'm elaborating all the reasons why I'm glad I don't have kids! And don't plan to for a good long while
177239649335517200,Wed Mar 07 03:50:00 +0000 2012,I think they should make a reverse 3 idiots.. show parents who feel pressurized to behave a certain way by their kids :D
177239323794604030,Wed Mar 07 03:48:42 +0000 2012,You spend half your life trying to be perfect for your family, the other half being perfect for your kids... bleddies!

177232342119747600,Wed Mar 07 03:20:57 +0000 2012,The thought of parenting terrifies me. You'll have to morph into that perfect person with impeccable cooking & all the answers.
177057523948470270,Tue Mar 06 15:46:17 +0000 2012,There's some Roadies video on FB with guys getting their balls beaten as a challenge. They'd never try pulling equivalent shit with girls.
177057182293032960,Tue Mar 06 15:44:56 +0000 2012,I love how ppl on these cooking shows ask where veggies have come from. In my grocer's case, I'm fairly sure I don't want to know.
177057023714791420,Tue Mar 06 15:44:18 +0000 2012,@poornimarmenon All this for one train ticket. Sigh. Still, better than traveling for 3 hours to and fro airports I guess.
177056852486520830,Tue Mar 06 15:43:37 +0000 2012,@varunshridhar True, that. This is very nostalgia inducing and all.

176711900833382400,Mon Mar 05 16:52:54 +0000 2012,Of course the fact that two of the three restaurants are potential clients also inspired me. But that's an aside.
176711656653602800,Mon Mar 05 16:51:56 +0000 2012,Went on a food run, gathered @scourgeofgods' fav starters from 3 different restaurants. #wifeoftheyearaward

176643149895184400,Mon Mar 05 12:19:43 +0000 2012,Forget sex ed... schools need spam ed. As in, don't poke unknown videos, they aren't always safe.
176642227366395900,Mon Mar 05 12:16:03 +0000 2012,Finally said out loud something that's been on my mind for a while... @JitendraBA thanks for listening to the rant!
176636782279000060,Mon Mar 05 11:54:25 +0000 2012,Cauliflower crust pizza. I'm revolted and intrigued and have to try it to believe it.
176614043493220350,Mon Mar 05 10:24:03 +0000 2012,IRCTC makes me think auto-haggling is way easy.

176586880421330940,Mon Mar 05 08:36:07 +0000 2012,The wifi at home can download movies in 5 minutes flat, but IRCTC's website manages to stump it.

146659835939790850,Tue Dec 13 18:36:44 +0000 2011,@A_Hiccup Lol, do you think they'll get it? More importantly, when's the less-controversial version due?
146659185927532540,Tue Dec 13 18:34:09 +0000 2011,@A_Hiccup Haha letters of recommendation are the weirdest.
146659051269406720,Tue Dec 13 18:33:37 +0000 2011,@varunshridhar Aw, thanks. And I'm changing that DP as soon as possible, now that you've said that.
146658905366347780,Tue Dec 13 18:33:02 +0000 2011,@A_Hiccup Lol. Ok, but it'll take you five hours to get around there. Here it takes half an hour. In peak traffic.
146658700751421440,Tue Dec 13 18:32:13 +0000 2011,@A_Hiccup I hear you need to start planning your statement of purpose when you're five years old to get it right.
146658403849220100,Tue Dec 13 18:31:02 +0000 2011,@A_Hiccup It's okay, it's kinda cute how you can take an auto around the whole city for some 150.

146652518066307070,Tue Dec 13 18:07:39 +0000 2011,@aishu_s That's cos the guy's invariably old enough to be grandfather/girl's young enough to be Bieber/they're cousins @anantha
146652146685849600,Tue Dec 13 18:06:11 +0000 2011,@anantha That sounds like a very good metaphor... sadly, in Madras, it's literal. @aishu_s
146651529145880580,Tue Dec 13 18:03:43 +0000 2011,@aishu_s But I didn't actually do one, so I don't know. Ohwell. There are good plays & Saarang to kill time with.
146651159548014600,Tue Dec 13 18:02:15 +0000 2011,@aishu_s They're the word-play competitions, things like Whose Line is it Anyway and Just a Minute. When things like 'saaptiya' dont cut it.

146649886597713920,Tue Dec 13 17:57:12 +0000 2011,@aishu_s Acho. WLIIA & JAM judges are usually the best of the lot. AdZap's also okay-okay. Definitely no suit-boots.
146649576894504960,Tue Dec 13 17:55:58 +0000 2011,@aishu_s It usually all makes sense by the final year, when you've figured out who's worth bitching to about aaaall the rest.
146649192721432580,Tue Dec 13 17:54:26 +0000 2011,@aishu_s Ah no, it's just character building. But culturals are fun, they bring smart, pretty boys around. Highlight of college, really.
146649040958926850,Tue Dec 13 17:53:50 +0000 2011,@anantha Also, 'I miss you'. Translated: 'Why haven't you texted me back (ever)' @aishu_s
146648436748455940,Tue Dec 13 17:51:26 +0000 2011,@aishu_s They are, no. Then again, when you're at a women's college, you realize so many girls are equally bad.
146648309291941900,Tue Dec 13 17:50:56 +0000 2011,@anantha Sigh. The specimens that are left in Madras are highly suspect. @aishu_s
