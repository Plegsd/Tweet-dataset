904350704021753900,Sun Sep 03 14:29:44 +0000 2017,13) ...and mourn his passing. /Thread.
904350607049453600,Sun Sep 03 14:29:21 +0000 2017,12) ...brought such joy to my Dad's life, and brought us closer together at a time when we were very far apart. For that, I am grateful...
904350389226655700,Sun Sep 03 14:28:29 +0000 2017,11) In conjunction with my Dad's death, it's a lot weightier than it would've been. Didn't know WB. (Obviously). But he (and Fagen)...
904350134930169900,Sun Sep 03 14:27:28 +0000 2017,10) So, hearing this morning about #WalterBecker 's death has hit me particularly hard. On its own, I would have been "sad".
904349899642286100,Sun Sep 03 14:26:32 +0000 2017,9) My Dad died just under 3 weeks ago. Steely Dan were mentioned at both services for him. He and I had repaired our relationship long ago.
904349519038607400,Sun Sep 03 14:25:01 +0000 2017,8) ...I liked it. A lot. (Aja was his main album). The Dan were the first band my Dad and I agreed upon. The first artistic thing we shared.
904349228046135300,Sun Sep 03 14:23:52 +0000 2017,7) The one band my Dad did love, utterly, was #SteelyDan. Played them constantly. And, to my surprise, even though it was "Dad's music"...
904348792903925800,Sun Sep 03 14:22:08 +0000 2017,@rushisaband 6) I, of course, reacted...like a teenager. "You don't UNDERSTAND ME!" In truth, he didn't. He didn't have the tools to.
904348531938521100,Sun Sep 03 14:21:06 +0000 2017,5) (Nothing wrong with that!) At 13, I discovered @rushisaband, which changed my life. My Dad especially, thought they were godawful noise.
904348224051441700,Sun Sep 03 14:19:53 +0000 2017,4) Despite these tapes, mostly for adult "get togethers" (read: weed), my parent's tastes were more "old-time" music: musicals, Sinatra.
904347922317410300,Sun Sep 03 14:18:41 +0000 2017,3) Allman Bros. "Eat a Peach". Leon Russell "Carny". Grateful Dead "Europe '72". CSNY "Deja Vu". Decent stuff. (And "Snoopy Come Home".)
904347698370932700,Sun Sep 03 14:17:47 +0000 2017,2) In our house in Seaford, Long Island, I got the "attic room", equipped with an 8-track player and my parent's few tapes.
904347493143633900,Sun Sep 03 14:16:58 +0000 2017,1) Other than friends and family, music has been the one constant in my life since I was about ten years old. (thread)
