303907127498514400,Tue Feb 19 16:41:20 +0000 2013,Shooting tip #6: Finish Forward. Shoulders squared to the rim, moving towards it. Fading away is okay in situations, but those are rare.

301714357677596700,Wed Feb 13 15:28:03 +0000 2013,often leads to leaving it short. Share this with friends and family, guys who make shots (not just take shots) are becoming more rare.
301714102353526800,Wed Feb 13 15:27:02 +0000 2013,Shooting tip #5, I am guessing you all have heard this one, but it's easy to forget: FOLLOW THROUGH. Finish your shot, pull your hand and

298493581365227500,Mon Feb 04 18:09:50 +0000 2013,Tip #5:  it's simple, but sometimes we forget the simple things, and over-complicate. Follow through.
