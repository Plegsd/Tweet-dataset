556266212322078700,Sat Jan 17 01:46:14 +0000 2015,@GloriaMiele Nope. That's the distinction I'm making. Postits are reminders/triggers, while labels define behavior. Big difference.
556266030004043800,Sat Jan 17 01:45:31 +0000 2015,If post-it reminders could appear only when relevant, that would be nice. Their persistence drains your attention (and energy)
556265106896474100,Sat Jan 17 01:41:51 +0000 2015,Post-it reminders nag you. Not good. But labels give clarity on what to do. Hooray!

552270377758781440,Tue Jan 06 01:08:13 +0000 2015,Change leads to change. Start changing what you *want* and trust that *shoulds" eventually become wants. It's a process.

547200931368935400,Tue Dec 23 01:24:03 +0000 2014,Some outcomes, like lasting weight loss, require process of change ‚Äî of learning. Just like learning to play a musical instrument

547199593734103040,Tue Dec 23 01:18:44 +0000 2014,Instead of wishing for miracle (and nothing happens), people can focus on learning to make small changes. Note ‚Äúlearning‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a skill.
547199393690951700,Tue Dec 23 01:17:56 +0000 2014,Yes, I do believe in radical changes. However, small changes can have big impact when done right. And it‚Äôs easier to design for those.

514200630173630460,Mon Sep 22 23:52:38 +0000 2014,So if you blend my work w/ Miller &amp; Dollard (1941): "Reward" will always create emotion. If no emotion, then it's not a "reward"
514200201251528700,Mon Sep 22 23:50:56 +0000 2014,Emotions make behavior more automatic. That's one reason we have emotions. #habitformation
514199753660583940,Mon Sep 22 23:49:09 +0000 2014,My working hypothesis --&gt; We feel emotions when fundamental drives are efficiently (or surprisingly) reduced. #habitformation
513462506611048450,Sat Sep 20 22:59:35 +0000 2014,In 1941 Miller &amp; Dollard explain what they mean by "reward" http://t.co/oFqRrBHrgN
513461198504075260,Sat Sep 20 22:54:24 +0000 2014,What Miller &amp; Dollard published in 1941. See how they define "learning" http://t.co/gqz4LzVCrx
513460189274865660,Sat Sep 20 22:50:23 +0000 2014,I'm excited to have this landmark book from 1941 http://t.co/K721DBDatr
513459281195040800,Sat Sep 20 22:46:46 +0000 2014,Don't misinterpret this quote from Millard &amp; Dollard (1941): "Without reward, people fail to learn." It doesn't mean what you think.
513458862758719500,Sat Sep 20 22:45:07 +0000 2014,Rough summary: "Reward" is something that reduces drive. "Learn" is behavior change.
513458341993910300,Sat Sep 20 22:43:02 +0000 2014,When Miller &amp; Dollard (1941) talk about "learning" they are talking about behavior change, not memorizing facts.
513457582795534340,Sat Sep 20 22:40:01 +0000 2014,Miller &amp; Dollard (1941): "The term 'reward' will be used hereinafter to refer to drive reduction . . ."
513457179186053100,Sat Sep 20 22:38:25 +0000 2014,Cool! --&gt; My 1st edition (1941) of Miller &amp; Dollard arrived. It maps out cue, behavior, reward. This book was part of Harvard's Library.

511599678039679000,Mon Sep 15 19:37:22 +0000 2014,The work of Hull and Thorndike informed Miller &amp; Dollard's work on habits. William James influenced all of them.

504438935653597200,Wed Aug 27 01:23:08 +0000 2014,As you know, I don't like the verb "breaking" to describe stopping a behavior. It's the wrong verb. "Untangle" is more accurate.
504438714865434600,Wed Aug 27 01:22:16 +0000 2014,House analogy is not ideas b/c building a house is harder than tearing it down. Whereas "breaking" a habit is harder than creating one.

440627408580775940,Mon Mar 03 23:18:55 +0000 2014,I'd like your view on tension vs reward. Research in my Stanford lab suggests tension-release is the #1 driver of apps used often

440599818453258240,Mon Mar 03 21:29:17 +0000 2014,The compulsion to check Fbook, Twittr, SMS is essentially nagging (FOMO). You check. Tension releases. Then cycle starts again.
440598510887391200,Mon Mar 03 21:24:05 +0000 2014,@Celt_Englishman @maneesh Agreed: No one loves nagging. But it can change behavior.
440592027315474400,Mon Mar 03 20:58:19 +0000 2014,Pavlok's reference to Pavlov is off the mark conceptually (wrong type of conditioning) but it's a clever product name. @maneesh
440590469550985200,Mon Mar 03 20:52:08 +0000 2014,The threat of being shocked (not the shock itself) is how the Pavlok system can influence behavior. cc @maneesh
440589756938731500,Mon Mar 03 20:49:18 +0000 2014,For the Pavlok device from @maneesh to work well, he must get the nagging part right.
440588796682178560,Mon Mar 03 20:45:29 +0000 2014,A system that threatens to shock u (nagware) until u do a behavior is leveraging negative reinforcement, not punishment. cc @maneesh

439873194833354750,Sat Mar 01 21:21:56 +0000 2014,Stanford emphasizes work of Bandura and Malone but doesn't focus much on SDT. Likely b/c of history and geography.

439866378875445250,Sat Mar 01 20:54:51 +0000 2014,The phrase "intrinsic motivation" is useful mostly as foil for talking about "extrinsic motivation." I prefer terms that are more precise.

439770373375016960,Sat Mar 01 14:33:22 +0000 2014,Hypothesis: Consistent exercisers aren't tapping willpower. Instead, they are getting pleasure from exercise.
439769704110899200,Sat Mar 01 14:30:42 +0000 2014,These activities offer different types of pleasure: dancing, walking in nature, playing on a team, lifting weights. (Other types?)

433703379789819900,Wed Feb 12 20:45:18 +0000 2014,@sthomas451 Not sure what best solution would be. But the current version isn't ideal.

433460239451430900,Wed Feb 12 04:39:09 +0000 2014,Right now my Stanford lab is focusing on trigger design. Maybe #amberalert would be a good project

433435419657519100,Wed Feb 12 03:00:31 +0000 2014,Triggers should be customized, pleasant, wanted, relevant, and actionable. Amber Alert fails on all these things  #amberalert

433433164669665300,Wed Feb 12 02:51:33 +0000 2014,Today's problem with Amber Alert stems from awful trigger design
433432108858478600,Wed Feb 12 02:47:22 +0000 2014,My guess: Amber Alert has made many enemies today.

422787492417257500,Mon Jan 13 17:49:27 +0000 2014,@steph_stern Fastest solution: Find approaches that works (for anyone, anywhere) and then look hard to see what makes it effective
422786684539772900,Mon Jan 13 17:46:15 +0000 2014,@steph_stern In general, changing people's motivation so they save energy is a tough b/c other things motivate people more (e.g. being lazy)

422785022383251460,Mon Jan 13 17:39:38 +0000 2014,@robertcercos One way: Ask to try the new behavior one time, as a test or just for fun.
422784866665496600,Mon Jan 13 17:39:01 +0000 2014,@dasutcliffe The overall answer is this: Behaviors that don't require effort and match our motivations we have at that time.
422784745412386800,Mon Jan 13 17:38:32 +0000 2014,@dasutcliffe I think for most Americans --&gt; Watching TV, snacking, sitting on couch are all easily maintained behaviors in evening.
422784500158844900,Mon Jan 13 17:37:34 +0000 2014,@jennyshen One way: Make the old behavior difficult (or impossible) to do. E.g., To not eat ice cream at night, don't store it at home.
422783951174791200,Mon Jan 13 17:35:23 +0000 2014,@JenKernSF Yes . . . and the environment as well.
422783596479266800,Mon Jan 13 17:33:59 +0000 2014,@jacobthurman Other option: Get them to take a really small (nonthreatening) baby step. Then another. Build feeling of success.
422783176109334500,Mon Jan 13 17:32:18 +0000 2014,@jacobthurman One way: You move them to a new place, surrounded by people who don't do the behavior.

330404879900217340,Fri May 03 19:33:56 +0000 2013,Behaviors are on a continuum from reflexive (no thinking) to deliberative (careful decision).

324724723994984450,Thu Apr 18 03:23:01 +0000 2013,@debbieduncan thank you for sharing this with me.   Inspirational.
324724430976741400,Thu Apr 18 03:21:52 +0000 2013,Scary insight today: The "use it or lose it" rule gets more dramatic as you get older.    (My piano playing skills tonight were awful)

324224776342208500,Tue Apr 16 18:16:25 +0000 2013,@gzicherm I think it's a rare individual who doesn't want to improve at least one aspect of their health. Help them focus on that aspect.
324189266055950340,Tue Apr 16 15:55:18 +0000 2013,@daverage My point is about habits, not action.
324187636606591000,Tue Apr 16 15:48:50 +0000 2013,Create health habits you *want* and stop wasting energy on habits that feel like *should*. As you progress, the shoulds become wants.
324185328598528000,Tue Apr 16 15:39:40 +0000 2013,@gzicherm I'm saying motivation is *not* the missing piece for most people to create health habits. On this point we may truly disagree.
324172661922074600,Tue Apr 16 14:49:20 +0000 2013,@gzicherm Please explain what you mean. Then I can respond.
324166036419125250,Tue Apr 16 14:23:00 +0000 2013,Mistake to think -&gt; People lack motivation to create health habits. Reality -&gt; They need guidance, simplicity, and well-timed triggers

323269664853614600,Sun Apr 14 03:01:08 +0000 2013,How often do you put on clothes either backward or inside-out? For me, it's daily. (--&gt; inside out . . . but that's a longer story).
323253686614769660,Sun Apr 14 01:57:39 +0000 2013,Formal? normal? Neither fits me.

319649273891409900,Thu Apr 04 03:15:00 +0000 2013,I predict the future of behavior change will be less about incentives and motivation, and MUCH more about "success momentum"
