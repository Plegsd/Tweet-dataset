762751809685426200,Mon Aug 08 20:46:17 +0000 2016,32 The CIA recruited a spy of great value and even greater potential, but lost him. The Shahram Amiri saga is John Le Carre worthy. The End.
762751351713570800,Mon Aug 08 20:44:28 +0000 2016,31 In the end, the CIA counseled themselves look more closely at the psychological signs of those they push to flee.
762750829522812900,Mon Aug 08 20:42:23 +0000 2016,30 In the end, the CIA concluded Shahram Amiri was not an Iranian intelligence plant, but a young man who had come to regret his decision
762750619014819800,Mon Aug 08 20:41:33 +0000 2016,29 The CIA could not dismiss the possibility that Amiri had been a double agent, and this bizarre double defection was an Iranian intel op
762750373245423600,Mon Aug 08 20:40:34 +0000 2016,28 Even before he flew back to Tehran (escorted by DSS agents to Dulles for a commercial flight), the CIA began a counterintelligence review
762750161911152600,Mon Aug 08 20:39:44 +0000 2016,27 And $5M. CIA warned him he'd be killed, but it was clear nothing would persuade him. He likely gave his life to save his son's. Tragic.
762749874161025000,Mon Aug 08 20:38:35 +0000 2016,26 It was too late: Amiri relented to Iranian pressure to return to Tehran in exchange for his son's life. He walked away from sunny Tucson
762749578126958600,Mon Aug 08 20:37:25 +0000 2016,25 Furious at the resettlement unit for what they saw as their failure to adequately monitor Amiri and tend to his emotional needs. By then,
762749199909789700,Mon Aug 08 20:35:55 +0000 2016,24 It was high stakes, global espionage in the YouTube age. Meanwhile, CIA officers working on the Iranian nuke program + Near East were
762748872913543200,Mon Aug 08 20:34:37 +0000 2016,23 Alternating stories of being kidnapped by the US and tortured, or teaching and studying of his own free will. The CIA was reeling
762748402824339500,Mon Aug 08 20:32:45 +0000 2016,22 Amiri that if he didnt make a propaganda video for them, they'd kill his son. Amiri agreed. Thus began the back + forth videos of Amiri
762748138969034800,Mon Aug 08 20:31:42 +0000 2016,21 Brother in law, rather than his wife, to reach his son. On an early call, Iranian intelligence agents got on the line + explicitly told
762747955711475700,Mon Aug 08 20:30:58 +0000 2016,20 He either hid well his anguish or NROC missed the signs, but he began Skyping home to Tehran to speak with his young son. He called his
762747663733448700,Mon Aug 08 20:29:48 +0000 2016,19 Where he tried to settle into a new life. Every few weeks, handlers from NROC, the CIA's relocation unit, met with him to check up on him
762747334103015400,Mon Aug 08 20:28:30 +0000 2016,18 disappointed Bush WH and Counter Proliferation experts in the IC. CIA out the bulk of his reward in escrow and moved him to Tucson, AZ
762747026924793900,Mon Aug 08 20:27:17 +0000 2016,17 thought he had left, though they came to the conclusion that his value was limited after his help with the NIE. He wasn't a bust, but he
762746829754789900,Mon Aug 08 20:26:30 +0000 2016,16 He was settled temporarily + debriefed in a Springfield, VA safehouse, not far from CIA headquarters. There, CIA squeezed everything they
762746571289157600,Mon Aug 08 20:25:28 +0000 2016,15 to flee Iran. In '09 he went to Medina, SA for pilgrimage. There, with the help of the Saudis, CIA whisked him away. He was 32 years old
762746244959707100,Mon Aug 08 20:24:10 +0000 2016,14 realized he had lied, and it was Amiri's effort to stall a defection. Ultimately, with a promise of $5M and a new identity, Amiri agreed
762745999899189200,Mon Aug 08 20:23:12 +0000 2016,13 to escape Iran overland. He told CIA that he had tried to get out via a few border crossings but was turned back. In retrospect, the CIA
762745695484973000,Mon Aug 08 20:21:59 +0000 2016,12. CIA continued to press, + later, after it was all over, a counterintelligence review determined that Amiri lied to CIA about his efforts
762745404584845300,Mon Aug 08 20:20:50 +0000 2016,11. He had no qualms about leaving her, but he couldnt see how he could get his son out with him. He put the CIA off on their proposals
762745223831314400,Mon Aug 08 20:20:07 +0000 2016,10. From the beginning, Amiri was ambivalent about defecting. It would require leaving his young son. He told the CIA that he hated his wife
762744884407263200,Mon Aug 08 20:18:46 +0000 2016,9. From CIA's view, the declass summary made it inevitable that Tehran trace back parts of the intel to Amiri. CIA pressed Amiri to leave
762744410010427400,Mon Aug 08 20:16:53 +0000 2016,8. The trouble came when the Bush WH released a declassified exec summary of the '07 NIE. The CIA was blindsided and upset with the decision
762744084754726900,Mon Aug 08 20:15:35 +0000 2016,7 Had decided to halt the weapons effort in 2003, and by '07 had not restarted it. For the Amiri and the CIA
762743811986583600,Mon Aug 08 20:14:30 +0000 2016,6. For US officials, his value came when he became a confirming source for the 2007 NIE on Iranian nuclear program. He confirmed that Tehran
762743570877059100,Mon Aug 08 20:13:33 +0000 2016,5. He had the potential to advance into a key position later, all the while reporting what he learned from his unwitting colleagues
762743413921943600,Mon Aug 08 20:12:55 +0000 2016,4. He was close to several important scientists in the Iranian program + because he was young-in his mid to late 20's when CIA recruited him
762743413921943600,Mon Aug 08 20:12:55 +0000 2016,4. He was close to several important scientists in the Iranian program + because he was young-in his mid to late 20's when CIA recruited him
762743150112682000,Mon Aug 08 20:11:52 +0000 2016,3. in a key university position for nuclear research. His value was not so much what he knew, as much as who he worked with and around
762742683295187000,Mon Aug 08 20:10:01 +0000 2016,2. Shahram Amiri had fantastic potential as a CIA intelligence asset inside one element of the Iranian nuclear program He was ideally placed

689449986161926100,Tue Jan 19 14:11:00 +0000 2016,6. Story raises questions about whether the best of the best can legitimately police themselves. Are they held to same standard as big Navy?

689449286124236800,Tue Jan 19 14:08:13 +0000 2016,4. Overall, poor optic for ST6 that their operators are using position to make $$ on the side based on their active duty status
689449014966648800,Tue Jan 19 14:07:09 +0000 2016,3. NCIS was very angry when DOJ closed their case against Bissonnette, but unclear why they havent charged him yet if they felt so strongly
