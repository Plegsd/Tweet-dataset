815838572720713700,Mon Jan 02 08:34:07 +0000 2017,@Tshirt_boy Who's saying it shoulda been called off? I'm saying if you're gonna shit on the optics of other people's moves, look at your own
815837817326563300,Mon Jan 02 08:31:07 +0000 2017,But no, please continue to explain to me the difference between vacations and diplomatic trips
815837717527306200,Mon Jan 02 08:30:44 +0000 2017,And if diplomatic trips are scheduled way in advance, you coulda shifted your announcement until after.
815837447531548700,Mon Jan 02 08:29:39 +0000 2017,Because the other inference is that you don't want to be around to answer for the shit-storm you created
815836879534702600,Mon Jan 02 08:27:24 +0000 2017,...especially when on that trip you have "Weddings are getting stuck LOL" as part of your speech.
815836699674579000,Mon Jan 02 08:26:41 +0000 2017,... you can argue that it's an important diplomatic trip until you're blue in the face, but please don't claim empathy with people yourself
815836484636815400,Mon Jan 02 08:25:50 +0000 2017,When you position yourself as the sole voice, announce a thing that no other authority seems to have concrete answers to, and then leave...
815836189190037500,Mon Jan 02 08:24:39 +0000 2017,Lol to everyone trying to explain the difference between a vacation &amp; a diplomatic trip to me.
