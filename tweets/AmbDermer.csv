781649250123976700,Fri Sep 30 00:17:58 +0000 2016,On the eve of Rosh Hashana, at a time when we are focused on our hopes for the year ahead, let us tonight remember Shimon Peres.
781648995928174600,Fri Sep 30 00:16:57 +0000 2016,President Peres was that rare leader who was both a dreamer and a doer-talking about the future one day and then making it happen the next.
781648904462954500,Fri Sep 30 00:16:35 +0000 2016,They are either people of vision who inspire or they are people of action who get things done. 2/2

781648597360250900,Fri Sep 30 00:15:22 +0000 2016,He is also only the 7th non-American to have received both the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
781648515411873800,Fri Sep 30 00:15:03 +0000 2016,tomorrow will be only the sixth time that an American flag will be flown at half-staff following the death of a foreign leader.¬† 2/2
781648441407598600,Fri Sep 30 00:14:45 +0000 2016,As for President Peres‚Äôs standing in America. 1/2
781648308402085900,Fri Sep 30 00:14:13 +0000 2016,Finance,Foreign and Defense Minister ‚Äì a distinction no American President can claim.¬†3/3

781648127195570200,Fri Sep 30 00:13:30 +0000 2016,Shimon Peres is the only Israeli to have been both President and Prime Minister. 1/3
781648035633922000,Fri Sep 30 00:13:08 +0000 2016,I appreciated him greatly for his life of service to Israel and for the central role he played in the life of Israel.
781647755555004400,Fri Sep 30 00:12:01 +0000 2016,I last saw President Peres 6 weeks ago.¬†He was as alert and dynamic as I had seen him in years.
781647604727898100,Fri Sep 30 00:11:25 +0000 2016,So tonight‚Äôs event is not just about celebrating the coming New Year.¬† It‚Äôs also about mourning the passing of one of Israel‚Äôs giants.
781647354416001000,Fri Sep 30 00:10:26 +0000 2016,But two days ago, our former President Shimon Peres passed away.
781647249898106900,Fri Sep 30 00:10:01 +0000 2016,To make clear how important this assistance is for Israel‚Äôs security as it will enable Israel defend itself by itself far into the future.
