845435457986998300,Sat Mar 25 00:41:35 +0000 2017,8) Healthcare is complicated. The core of the #ACA represents a 25-year bipartisan conclusion about what works. Stick with what works.
845432221901074400,Sat Mar 25 00:28:43 +0000 2017,7) They can "repeal" the name and call it something else, add a few modest fixes, and claim they replaced Obamacare.
845430192516444200,Sat Mar 25 00:20:39 +0000 2017,6) Luckily, they don't have to start from scratch. The #ACA is that market-based reform plan, modeled on Chafee and Romney.
845426414450978800,Sat Mar 25 00:05:39 +0000 2017,5) Even though versions of it have existed in the past, they could call it whatever they want. But I recommend against personalizing it.
845424866387943400,Fri Mar 24 23:59:30 +0000 2017,4) Mass. Gov. Romney signed his plan into law in 2006. Six years later, Romney was the GOP presidential nominee &amp; won 47.2% of the vote.
845423262330892300,Fri Mar 24 23:53:07 +0000 2017,2) Appropriately, given the GOP majority, the reform could be modeled on proposals by 2 R's - Mitt Romney and the late Sen. John Chafee.
845422418550149100,Fri Mar 24 23:49:46 +0000 2017,3) Chafee's bill, a GOP alternative to Pres. Clinton's plan in 1993, had 18 Republican co-sponsors, including majority leader Bob Dole.
845419993089003500,Fri Mar 24 23:40:08 +0000 2017,1) With #AHCA dead, both parties can now come together around market-based healthcare reform that greatly expands coverage &amp; reduces costs.
