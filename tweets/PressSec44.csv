446407055273103360,Wed Mar 19 22:05:10 +0000 2014,The Speaker was less circumspect in 1996, when he said: "I'll commit suicide before I vote on a clean minimum-wage bill."
446404770451189760,Wed Mar 19 21:56:05 +0000 2014,The Speaker opposes raising the min wage to $10.10. In '07, he voted no to $7.25. And in 1996, he voted no to $5.15. I see a trend here.
