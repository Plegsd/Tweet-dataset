868499174291066900,Sat May 27 16:08:33 +0000 2017,2/ So it could apply to Kushner during the transition period if he already knew he was going to be a WH official.  The law makes it a

863092813533204500,Fri May 12 18:05:36 +0000 2017,If Trump is actually taping convos, the Pres Records Act requires they be archived, and would violate criminal law (18USC641) to delete them
