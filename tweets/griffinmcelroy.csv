926473120302731300,Fri Nov 03 15:36:19 +0000 2017,@KyleOrl To hit 999, you have to buy all you can buy. I forget how many that is, it‚Äôs well over 100 though.

910557676265803800,Wed Sep 20 17:34:02 +0000 2017,It demands ABSOLUTE precision from its players, while also having mechanics that ultimately are kinda imprecise
910557198182375400,Wed Sep 20 17:32:08 +0000 2017,Lost rounds because ammo just wouldn‚Äôt drop, one to him wiping us after popping his shield, a couple to wall weirdness in the shadow world
910556966249947100,Wed Sep 20 17:31:12 +0000 2017,Dropped Calus again w/ Juice today, and I think I‚Äôm probably done running that fight until some stuff gets worked out.

903734387052879900,Fri Sep 01 21:40:43 +0000 2017,the most exciting announcement about Destiny 2 that Bungie‚Äôs made is that character looks from D1 can carry over. CRJ‚Äôs legacy lives on

903731583047405600,Fri Sep 01 21:29:34 +0000 2017,We‚Äôre talking about also spinning up an Awful Squad-style weekly stream in Destiny 2, which I‚Äôm real REAL excited about.
903731348728422400,Fri Sep 01 21:28:38 +0000 2017,PUBG scratches a social gaming itch that‚Äôs one of my pillars of why I play games. Destiny was that before, D2 will be that for a while, now.

903718541270057000,Fri Sep 01 20:37:45 +0000 2017,It‚Äôs a super basic primer, though, so if you‚Äôre already into Destiny and know what to expect, there‚Äôs probably nothing new there for you.
903718439927283700,Fri Sep 01 20:37:21 +0000 2017,Every time I tweet about Destiny 2, I get that question, and I‚Äôm hoping this video can help answer it for most folks.

902985370157154300,Wed Aug 30 20:04:23 +0000 2017,I love how cohesive that build is.   1. Shoot while hovering 2. Aerial dodge 3. Recharge abilities w/ aerial kills 4. Speed boost on melee
902984944972124200,Wed Aug 30 20:02:42 +0000 2017,The utility of the Sentinel Titan seems great, but it‚Äôs just not as fun as flying through the air, shooting enemies as you soar

902265516022169600,Mon Aug 28 20:23:56 +0000 2017,@dantelfer Yeah, I enjoyed them more this time around. Especially Voidwalker, it has so much more variety to its abilities in D2
902265085992697900,Mon Aug 28 20:22:14 +0000 2017,Curious what's gonna be most popular day one. What class are you going to play first in Destiny 2?
902264479785902100,Mon Aug 28 20:19:49 +0000 2017,Also if Void Hunter really is back, that‚Äôs hard to pass up, was easily my favorite time playing Destiny 1
902264253448675300,Mon Aug 28 20:18:55 +0000 2017,And the Warlock recharge-transfer abilities (consume Super to power Grenades, consume Grenades to heal) seem like they‚Äôd be a lot of fun too
902264042613592000,Mon Aug 28 20:18:05 +0000 2017,The raw utility of Sentinel Titan seems like it‚Äôs completely my jam, but Arc Hunter‚Äôs Dodge-Melee-Repeat combo is so, so fun.
902263889123037200,Mon Aug 28 20:17:29 +0000 2017,After playing all three classes in the PC beta, I feel like I‚Äôm back at square one in deciding which to play first.
902244945318338600,Mon Aug 28 19:02:12 +0000 2017,I‚Äôm gonna be playing on PS4, for sure, though. The later release date on PC kinda makes the decision for me
902244379368333300,Mon Aug 28 18:59:57 +0000 2017,Destiny 2 feels *so* good on PC, but all my buddies play on PS4. My kingdom for cross-platform saves.

898411261804687400,Fri Aug 18 05:08:31 +0000 2017,But for three years, this story has meant so much to me. And I know it has for other people, too. I‚Äôm so grateful to have had it in my life.
898411103973105700,Fri Aug 18 05:07:53 +0000 2017,I do not want to sound like I‚Äôm afraid of moving on. I am filled with excitement to tell new stories in new worlds with my family!

898410707338670100,Fri Aug 18 05:06:18 +0000 2017,I dropped all the notes from the campaign into one document. It‚Äôs nearly 450 pages, 116,000 words. It all adds up, over time.
898410008076931100,Fri Aug 18 05:03:32 +0000 2017,It‚Äôs just really, really bittersweet, but satisfying in ways I haven‚Äôt quite processed yet. I think I learned new emotions today.
898409665796513800,Fri Aug 18 05:02:10 +0000 2017,Working on this campaign was an activity that I really, earnestly treasured, and it is a very profound sensation to have that work finished.

832988318367354900,Sat Feb 18 16:21:05 +0000 2017,by keeping a lv 1 character on your team, you generally get matched against lower level teams

828447576114491400,Mon Feb 06 03:37:48 +0000 2017,fairness or whatever aside, how fuckin anti-climactic is the ‚Äúfirst possession touchdown wins‚Äù rule
828446771256946700,Mon Feb 06 03:34:36 +0000 2017,the nfl should kick those overtime rules over to coolgames inc for a lil bit of the ol‚Äô spit shine
828445525137559600,Mon Feb 06 03:29:39 +0000 2017,the helmets kissing was still great. really, both teams won for that moment, if you think about it
828442583982624800,Mon Feb 06 03:17:58 +0000 2017,great news, i bought a super bowl commercial during overtime for $100 in which I talk about how great my cat is, keep an eye out
828426013554143200,Mon Feb 06 02:12:07 +0000 2017,for a moment the game stopped and the helmets formed a kissing armistice. then the game started up again and the patriots lost some more
828425794481438700,Mon Feb 06 02:11:15 +0000 2017,my highlight of this game is the two helmets that got stuck together in a defiant kiss!!  another is watching the patriots lose completely

827963368401141800,Sat Feb 04 19:33:44 +0000 2017,one thing I would recommend is have at least 1 magic user on your team for hi-DEF low-RES foes ‚Äî I was getting murdered before I had Maria

807344052744110100,Fri Dec 09 21:59:56 +0000 2016,i think sometimes game devs fall so in love w/ their characters while they‚Äôre making them and assume everyone else will too from SCENE ONE
807343798040887300,Fri Dec 09 21:58:55 +0000 2016,i can‚Äôt understand leaving main character introductions out of a game wholesale. it‚Äôs an inexplicably bad decision

807342477833277400,Fri Dec 09 21:53:41 +0000 2016,Yup. The game lands little emotional jabs at the end that could have been haymakers https://t.co/MpEhlGcQ3I
807342253429637100,Fri Dec 09 21:52:47 +0000 2016,the sheer scope of character development done in Brotherhood: FF15 (and NOT IN THE GAME) is preposterous and infuriating
807341990534873100,Fri Dec 09 21:51:44 +0000 2016,FF15 is chock-full of interesting characters who, if you just play the game, you are not going to care about very much
807341795566907400,Fri Dec 09 21:50:58 +0000 2016,ultimately I think the approach to story (all standalone multimedia things and apparently DLC expansions) is kind of criminal.

807339129231052800,Fri Dec 09 21:40:22 +0000 2016,i think a story patch would be great. just some stuff to explain why the fuck anyone's doing ANYTHING the first 2/3rds of the game

796003068903125000,Tue Nov 08 14:54:55 +0000 2016,Don‚Äôt spend all day on Twitter, bear-baiting or picking fights or RTing people whose entire industry is getting folks to RT their hatred.
796002483537662000,Tue Nov 08 14:52:35 +0000 2016,Please, please go vote today. There is so much at stake, globally, nationally, locally. It would mean a lot to me.
795779617890123800,Tue Nov 08 00:07:00 +0000 2016,@Babylonian welcome to the fucking jungle
795779515205218300,Tue Nov 08 00:06:35 +0000 2016,tomorrow is another day, though
795779440735387600,Tue Nov 08 00:06:18 +0000 2016,I did this maybe 50 times this afternoon? And I got one okay layout, which I ultimately bailed on.
795778791176020000,Tue Nov 08 00:03:43 +0000 2016,They will all be trash, and if you want four more, you have to close the game, relaunch it, start a new game, and repeat the process.
795778668639428600,Tue Nov 08 00:03:14 +0000 2016,Anyways, when you start the game, you have to confirm a few things, enter your name and the town‚Äôs name, and then get shown FOUR maps.
795778374245449700,Tue Nov 08 00:02:03 +0000 2016,The ‚Äúprivate beach‚Äù means it‚Äôs inaccessible unless you swim to it w/ a wetsuit. Which is ‚Ä¶ important for the series I want to do.
795778286211240000,Tue Nov 08 00:01:42 +0000 2016,Neighbor placement obvs isn‚Äôt as important ‚Äî they‚Äôll move out and more will move in. But it‚Äôs not a bad thing to consider starting out.
795777930253267000,Tue Nov 08 00:00:18 +0000 2016,A Re-Tail that‚Äôs far away from the dock makes the selling process so much longer, as it takes 3 trips to sell a full box of stuff.
795777771746295800,Mon Nov 07 23:59:40 +0000 2016,The fastest way to make money in the game is to go to the island, catch rare bugs and fish, and sell them at Re-Tail.
795777694575247400,Mon Nov 07 23:59:21 +0000 2016,Towns can have 1 - 5 ponds. More ponds = less usable land. PWPs can‚Äôt be built too close to rocks (another variable), ledges, houses, water.
795777489293426700,Mon Nov 07 23:58:32 +0000 2016,The more open land you have, the more space you have for PWP (public work projects). Some rivers form narrow, PWP-unfriendly strips of land.
795777349061066800,Mon Nov 07 23:57:59 +0000 2016,This, in and of itself, is a hard thing to guarantee. Most map layouts feature winding, long rivers that reduce total usable land.
795777257121939500,Mon Nov 07 23:57:37 +0000 2016,A ‚Äúshort river‚Äù usually starts halfway on one side, turns 90 degrees once, then ends halfway on the other side, making a 1/4 landmass.
795777131183800300,Mon Nov 07 23:57:07 +0000 2016,Rivers in your town layout are HUGELY variable. Some wind and form peninsulas. Some are straight shots. Some are diagonals.
795776997377065000,Mon Nov 07 23:56:35 +0000 2016,Lots of folks have questions about this stuff, and after two straight hours of resetting, I feel like an expert, so:
795776702525931500,Mon Nov 07 23:55:25 +0000 2016,Perfect layout is, of course:  - Short river - 1 - 2 ponds - Re-Tail near the dock - I like a private (no-ramp) beach - Lined-up houses
795774673632034800,Mon Nov 07 23:47:21 +0000 2016,on a related note, damn Rover to hell forever
795774608645492700,Mon Nov 07 23:47:06 +0000 2016,Just tried to record a little AC: New Leaf video but didn‚Äôt get far because I spent like two hours just trying to get a perfect map layout
