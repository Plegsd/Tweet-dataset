453559832138637300,Tue Apr 08 15:47:45 +0000 2014,So sad to hear about passing of @JohnPinette. Only got to know him recently - what a sweet &amp; funny man. A big spark of goodness.  RIP John.
452533587594977300,Sat Apr 05 19:49:49 +0000 2014,Don't feel bad - nobody did. “@OhMeadhbh:. i'm generally a fan of @PaulReiser but had no idea he had his own show a couple years back”
452430306536992800,Sat Apr 05 12:59:25 +0000 2014,Kids can not anticipate. I said "Take a jacket - it's 40 degrees out" My son says "I'm not cold" I said "Yes, because you're still inside."
451563526146891800,Thu Apr 03 03:35:08 +0000 2014,Just learned fundamental truth about peanut butter: cold=good. Hot peanut butter - NOT so much. Too long and stupid to explain why I know.

448985555091460100,Thu Mar 27 00:51:12 +0000 2014,@MichaelPacholek @StephenHawkings Fair enough. But I'm saying… Otherwise?
448984932463833100,Thu Mar 27 00:48:44 +0000 2014,So @StephenHawkings tells us Black holes are really grey. Lemme ask you - unless you were trying to match carpeting, how big a deal is this?
448627183792033800,Wed Mar 26 01:07:10 +0000 2014,1 more thing on KALE: you'd think if they come up w/ a new veg, they'd eliminate another one. Like broccoli Or endive. But no - still here

446883261461966850,Fri Mar 21 05:37:26 +0000 2014,@HuffingtonPost posted a piece I did on David Brenner.  If you have a moment, check it out. It meant a lot to me.  http://t.co/TBdb9eds6T
446789893134364700,Thu Mar 20 23:26:26 +0000 2014,Next I'm gonna make predictions about "Sopranos" season 3
446789664448331800,Thu Mar 20 23:25:31 +0000 2014,My guess- and this is dumb because you all already know - but I'm guessing "Doug" doesn't live to season 3. That's all I'm saying.
446783534720487400,Thu Mar 20 23:01:10 +0000 2014,Ok. 4 episodes left of @HouseofCards (I'm not a binge watcher) Hard part is telling everyone to shut up and not tell me what happens next.
446453274666098700,Thu Mar 20 01:08:50 +0000 2014,And yes - @jennyslate IS much younger than me ( I knew you were thinking that ) It's by design. Don't be judging !

444967201565847550,Sat Mar 15 22:43:42 +0000 2014,Just heard about David Brenner's passing. He was such a huge part of why  so many of us became comics.  This makes me very sad. RIP David.

53339553729232900,Thu Mar 31 06:15:15 +0000 2011,Lovely Helen Hunt on Leno tonight - graciously plugged my show -  of which she directed an episode. (terrifically - i might add)
52562716849750020,Tue Mar 29 02:48:22 +0000 2011,Okay - did you notice - as soon as i said tweets seem to be all nice, the snarky ones started. coincidence? maybe, maybe not. Discuss.
52430704226729980,Mon Mar 28 18:03:48 +0000 2011,and the lovely Amy Landecker ( the naked woman from "a Serious Man") plays my wife. She is  even funnier with clothes on. She's fantastic.
52391177227476990,Mon Mar 28 15:26:44 +0000 2011,and if Omid Djalili & Duane Martin & Ben Shenkman weren't enough, the absurdly funny Andy Daly is also in cast of new show.How lucky am I?
52227914225303550,Mon Mar 28 04:37:59 +0000 2011,@AmirTalai Yes  of course - mini - OMid - Amir Talai tremendously funny too. Goes without saying!
52149832760049660,Sun Mar 27 23:27:43 +0000 2011,RT @homeion: @PaulReiser Commentors fake beiing intellectual, but tweeters are themselves,(nice or nasty, but) more honest.
52147897495601150,Sun Mar 27 23:20:02 +0000 2011,@jersey_girl130  hey - feel free to tell everyone in NJ to tune in! thanks
52147552388259840,Sun Mar 27 23:18:40 +0000 2011,good question @Poselay probably not till  the fall  feel free to start a movement
52147257587408900,Sun Mar 27 23:17:29 +0000 2011,Omid Djalili, also in my new show - huge comic in UK and funniest man on the planet. I hope this show gets huge just for him. check him out.
51706482902831100,Sat Mar 26 18:06:00 +0000 2011,wow - those were really good, insightful answers. I'm actually a little smarter now. Thanks.
51662724031193090,Sat Mar 26 15:12:07 +0000 2011,so riddle me this: blog commentors are often snarky but tweets are almost always nice. It's the same population. Discuss and explain please
51336181274771460,Fri Mar 25 17:34:34 +0000 2011,saw 1st promos NBC made  - not too bad. anyone see it last night? ( or they just  lying to me pretending it's on air ?)
51119144665489410,Fri Mar 25 03:12:08 +0000 2011,did interview before - told them how exceptionally brilliant the cast of the show is. Can't wait for you all to see.
51061421794000900,Thu Mar 24 23:22:46 +0000 2011,so basically, all these people sitting in offices who look like they're working are really just reading this?
51003146327175210,Thu Mar 24 19:31:12 +0000 2011,i can't believe 30 mins in  I have 250 followers. Ironically, my own children don't listen to a word I say. You guys are much nicer.
51000952756510720,Thu Mar 24 19:22:29 +0000 2011,okay -  15 minutes in and i've already got nothing to say. How's this: "yesterday, I had a very enjoyable sandwich. " Is that a good tweet?
50999356781891580,Thu Mar 24 19:16:08 +0000 2011,@mattpol congratulations. The trophy is on it's way. And believe me it will be very very special. I;'m not just saying that
50998596849512450,Thu Mar 24 19:13:07 +0000 2011,@Millumino okay so that's one. who else do you know?
50997588970831870,Thu Mar 24 19:09:07 +0000 2011,@Jason_Pollock - I could not be more thrilled that u r following me now. How do I get everyone in the world to watch my show on April 14?
50994660310654980,Thu Mar 24 18:57:29 +0000 2011,This is my very first tweet and I'll be honest with you - it already makes no sense. I'm typing to myself in a room. I don't see the appeal.
