839537171820396500,Wed Mar 08 18:03:54 +0000 2017,@rajupp @2shar @arunsathiya So, if you are using only wallet for making third party payments, then you pay 2% more.
839536974394445800,Wed Mar 08 18:03:07 +0000 2017,@rajupp @2shar @arunsathiya I mean if you are paying a 1000 value bill, payable will be 1000-voucher. Or buying something.

839498352156885000,Wed Mar 08 15:29:38 +0000 2017,@vijayshekhar Now, i pay 2% more every single time. Yes, i get it back, but i'm recharging my wallet more than what i need. 2/3.
839497226267344900,Wed Mar 08 15:25:10 +0000 2017,@vijayshekhar Sentiment is-never have i transferred even a single penny to my bank. I recharge wallet every single time i make payment. 1/2
839496055200821200,Wed Mar 08 15:20:31 +0000 2017,@vijayshekhar Why charge more at the first place? I understand the misuse, but why not isolate this charge to such accounts?
839495306609819600,Wed Mar 08 15:17:32 +0000 2017,So, PayTM will be charging 2% for adding money to wallet via credit card. Will never use this service anymore! https://t.co/6WNaJKPqlq
