821816880927309800,Wed Jan 18 20:29:47 +0000 2017,@cbredesen Thank you. You can somewhat work around it by using cross connections, but it’s not ideal.
821813341484187600,Wed Jan 18 20:15:43 +0000 2017,@cbredesen We considered it, but the requirements are too different. Would have to be a completely new app to works great.
821661787284275200,Wed Jan 18 10:13:30 +0000 2017,@diddeb Makes sense. We would like to add this feature sometime, but current not on top of our roadmap.

818453120141455400,Mon Jan 09 13:43:24 +0000 2017,@noya_eos Thank you for the follow up. We will look into it. Might be that there is a problem with the baseline.
818452020323582000,Mon Jan 09 13:39:02 +0000 2017,@pattaprateek Got it. I can reproduce it when the aspect ratio changes. We will fix this.
818385532480847900,Mon Jan 09 09:14:50 +0000 2017,@noya_eos Can you share what font your are using. Do you also see the same issue with e.g. Helvetica Neue?
818384674095558700,Mon Jan 09 09:11:25 +0000 2017,@pattaprateek Not sure I understand what you mean. Do you resize it using the knobs on the canvas or the inspector?

817093129899745300,Thu Jan 05 19:39:17 +0000 2017,@_man_overbored_ Not sure I understand what you mean. Something like a word cloud? This wouldn’t work with MindNode.

801082122693967900,Tue Nov 22 15:17:16 +0000 2016,@linzb93 Hmm. I wonder if this could be related to the system language. Which one are you using?

800427968661164000,Sun Nov 20 19:57:53 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ If you can reproduce a crash, any steps that can trigger this would help. Thx.
800427712175341600,Sun Nov 20 19:56:52 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ At the moment we only save text once editing ends (the reason behind this is to ensure it’s all added to one undo group).
800425142060982300,Sun Nov 20 19:46:39 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ In general saving is triggered at certain times as decided by the system. Force quitting will never trigger a save operation.
800423583231180800,Sun Nov 20 19:40:28 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ Are you still seeing issues on Mac as well? At the moment we are not aware of any issues related to notes saving.

796303025698721800,Wed Nov 09 10:46:50 +0000 2016,@chrisrudman So a mode where only a subtree is visible and only the open tasks of this subtree in the sidebar.
796302912356044800,Wed Nov 09 10:46:23 +0000 2016,@chrisrudman My concern is that it might be too noise as the content in the sidebar would always change. A focus “mode” might be better.
796301878267146200,Wed Nov 09 10:42:17 +0000 2016,@chrisrudman So basically a way to only show a single subtree?

776711226936156200,Fri Sep 16 09:16:01 +0000 2016,@EDMusicaal Sorry, we currently don’t support xmind files, but we hope to support it in the future.
776490220585877500,Thu Sep 15 18:37:49 +0000 2016,@TomsUsedCars I'm very sorry about this. In what situations are you seeing this issue?
776123046478446600,Wed Sep 14 18:18:48 +0000 2016,@caryl_shaw Yes, you can disable Smart Layout on the Document inspector tab.
775981380287205400,Wed Sep 14 08:55:52 +0000 2016,@Wingerie Sorry, not possible at the moment. I’ll add your +1 to the feature request!
775755151848120300,Tue Sep 13 17:56:55 +0000 2016,@twe7 MindNode Pro is our old version. It’s no longer maintained.
775755071162376200,Tue Sep 13 17:56:36 +0000 2016,@EDMusicaal I think it works pretty good if you use the keyboard shortcuts, but of course a bigger screen helps keep a better overview.
775392090020778000,Mon Sep 12 17:54:15 +0000 2016,@_hroe I changed the setting. Should work now. Have a good flight. /cc @MacSparky
775247323668570100,Mon Sep 12 08:19:00 +0000 2016,@cpat407 Yes we plan to fully support tabs, but might not be able to ship before early October.
775247007002787800,Mon Sep 12 08:17:44 +0000 2016,@TomsUsedCars Yes, there is unfortunately no way to do cross platform bundles or apps right now.
774249953879351300,Fri Sep 09 14:15:48 +0000 2016,@SamMokorosi We currently have no plans for a Windows version. A web app would be more likely.
774249849004974100,Fri Sep 09 14:15:23 +0000 2016,@SirCalebGrove Not at the moment, but we plan to add new integration in the future.
773492336487718900,Wed Sep 07 12:05:18 +0000 2016,@jutkko I can reproduce this issue. We will have a look at it. In the meantime I recommend you use the iCloudDrive app.
773490611961946100,Wed Sep 07 11:58:27 +0000 2016,@paragsj I’m very sorry if anything in our marketing made you beliefe we have a Windows version. Please request a refund from Apple.
773088715107434500,Tue Sep 06 09:21:27 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver Not sure why it allowed you to select the OPML file. I’ll have a look at it.
773088567979544600,Tue Sep 06 09:20:52 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver The interface in MindNode sadly only supports files that can be saved back to the file provider.
773084413685035000,Tue Sep 06 09:04:22 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver I opened the file using the iCloud Drive app. Using this it works fine.
773081948583497700,Tue Sep 06 08:54:34 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver Thx. I noticed the file has a .opml.txt extension. Did you add the .txt part? When I remove it, the import works for me.
773069225439158300,Tue Sep 06 08:04:00 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver I’m unable to reproduce this. Can you send me a sample document? Thank you support@ideasoncanvas.com
772832243064643600,Mon Sep 05 16:22:19 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ Glad you found a solution that's working for you. We changed this to have a consistent import/export.
772831587037802500,Mon Sep 05 16:19:43 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver Interesting. I checked the code and we don't check the OPML version. I'll have a closer look at this. Thx
772704565510697000,Mon Sep 05 07:54:59 +0000 2016,@andrewpontius We sadly currently don’t support a collaboration feature.
772704368051232800,Mon Sep 05 07:54:12 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ You can change the default level via the CLI: https://t.co/MqZ1rQWaTC (but as I mentioned it also depends on other factors)
772364545931305000,Sun Sep 04 09:23:52 +0000 2016,@steveofmaine This is sadly currently not supported. We have no idea how to best support this. Do you have a suggestion?
772364140350505000,Sun Sep 04 09:22:15 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver From what cloud service are you importing? The warning more or less means that saving fail.
772363841246228500,Sun Sep 04 09:21:04 +0000 2016,@xy_guyver Yes you can paste a text outline into the app or import a txt file.
772360364872851500,Sun Sep 04 09:07:15 +0000 2016,@goslins We currently have no plans for a Mac promo. We try not to change the price too often.
771705196472926200,Fri Sep 02 13:43:51 +0000 2016,@MrApe_ Turns our we did change this. The max header now also depends on tasks and how many mind maps you have on the canvas.
771049238281281500,Wed Aug 31 18:17:18 +0000 2016,@abrahamsdarren Unfortunately this is currently not supported, but we are working on it.
771049128373739500,Wed Aug 31 18:16:52 +0000 2016,@boyomebucko We have no plans for a Windows version. Can’t share any plans for a cloud version right now.
770889216205226000,Wed Aug 31 07:41:26 +0000 2016,@villahwong Do you get the same error message? Could you send us a sample document with this issue. Thank you!
770883455102152700,Wed Aug 31 07:18:32 +0000 2016,@villahwong This looks like the picker in MindNode. Please use the Dropbox app to open files from Dropbox.
770879583105196000,Wed Aug 31 07:03:09 +0000 2016,@StephenCordwell Yes for RTF and Word we currently use bullet lists. Improving this is on our list, but so far never made it to the top.

770877882843426800,Wed Aug 31 06:56:24 +0000 2016,@torgerson Both versions should work fine. Rebooting the Mac normally helps.
770877727951945700,Wed Aug 31 06:55:47 +0000 2016,@StephenCordwell What export format would work for you? Markdown exports heads.

770640392899399700,Tue Aug 30 15:12:42 +0000 2016,@villahwong Can you please try to directly import it using the Dropbox app.
770640194894762000,Tue Aug 30 15:11:54 +0000 2016,@jordanborth Perhaps because the text is display only. In general they recommend not to use it.
770264449097855000,Mon Aug 29 14:18:50 +0000 2016,People often ask us, what mind mapping actually is. We created this short video to get them interested. https://t.co/QOYFRRXhAU
770232496734756900,Mon Aug 29 12:11:52 +0000 2016,@lvarayut Sorry, there is nothing new we can share at the moment about a collaboration feature.

769604999076806700,Sat Aug 27 18:38:25 +0000 2016,@theneekname 2.0 was a paid upgrade. 3.0 is currently planned as a free update.
769604743006216200,Sat Aug 27 18:37:23 +0000 2016,@jordanborth This is also the reason why it's not exposed in the system font picker.
769604549187346400,Sat Aug 27 18:36:37 +0000 2016,@jordanborth Apple discourages this. San Francisco should be used for controls only.

768711371542396900,Thu Aug 25 07:27:27 +0000 2016,@RizwanZz We are considering other services, but as each integration requires continued maintenance we can't add every app.

767387002358628400,Sun Aug 21 15:44:53 +0000 2016,@ArnoudKok There is currently no template system in MindNode, but as you suggested copy&amp;paste will work
766614837375955000,Fri Aug 19 12:36:34 +0000 2016,@fabrika You used MyMN from the same device yesterday and it stopped working today? Did you change anything related to iCloud?

766007622239682600,Wed Aug 17 20:23:43 +0000 2016,@sarahbluma The user used two main nodes and manual layout to get it to work. You can dl the document and see how it is done.

764549141980733400,Sat Aug 13 19:48:14 +0000 2016,@mattboettger It used to be an iCloud limitation. We are sticking with it as it makes file management on iOS easier. iWork is doing the same
764496500424601600,Sat Aug 13 16:19:04 +0000 2016,@mtedwards @Niall_cspace No, it's exactly the same. We use the TaskPaper format to import the tasks into OmniFocus.
763998643254767600,Fri Aug 12 07:20:45 +0000 2016,@goslins it's only in the print magazine (and German only)
763727527147954200,Thu Aug 11 13:23:26 +0000 2016,@nuntz No, this is only possible with Reminders as it provides a system framework for this.

760851932068061200,Wed Aug 03 14:56:51 +0000 2016,@freshmango I think you are right. I’ll look into adding code to change the shortcut based on localization.
760820120671383600,Wed Aug 03 12:50:26 +0000 2016,@marcfromboxer Thank you for sharing. This makes sense. I’ll create a new feature request.
760819916563943400,Wed Aug 03 12:49:38 +0000 2016,@freshmango As a work around I’d suggest you add a mapping for the MindNode shortcuts in SystemPreferences. This should help.
760819787748483100,Wed Aug 03 12:49:07 +0000 2016,@freshmango Could it be that you are using a localization that has different shortcuts or did you perhaps change it in System Preferences?
760819691883532300,Wed Aug 03 12:48:44 +0000 2016,@freshmango We adopted the same shortcuts as in the iWork apps as cycling is CMD-` by default in most localizations.
760818144814432300,Wed Aug 03 12:42:35 +0000 2016,@garc We considered a mode where you can fully hide all other nodes, but your suggestion is really interesting.

753926092302475300,Fri Jul 15 12:16:02 +0000 2016,@chrisrudman We agree and would also like to change it. But really hard to do for variable widths.
753925921132912600,Fri Jul 15 12:15:21 +0000 2016,@Fred_Sahakian We are aware of this issue and both should go live with our new website in 1-2 weeks. Sorry about the delay.

753631298854457300,Thu Jul 14 16:44:38 +0000 2016,@cwawak thank you for the follow up. Glad it works
753598712077774800,Thu Jul 14 14:35:08 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare You need to update the file directly from MindNode via the iCloud Drive picker. Open it and than selection “Locations”.
753598614128189400,Thu Jul 14 14:34:45 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare Sorry no update on this.
753548077391351800,Thu Jul 14 11:13:56 +0000 2016,@cwawak Let me know if it works. MindNode also supports Apple’s download able fonts (last section in the fonts list)
753547121551441900,Thu Jul 14 11:10:08 +0000 2016,@cwawak So if you install the font on your iOS device, it should appear in MindNode’s list. Is this font installed on your device?
753523219827716100,Thu Jul 14 09:35:10 +0000 2016,@landloops Is there something you are missing in MindNode? What would you change?
753523146460987400,Thu Jul 14 09:34:52 +0000 2016,@cwawak Do you mean on iOS or Mac?
753523099354693600,Thu Jul 14 09:34:41 +0000 2016,@arnoutdrenthel Please go to the Shortcut Preferences and update the shortcut. This is sadly bug related to a new shortcut.

751115707719573500,Thu Jul 07 18:08:34 +0000 2016,@BenPelissie We feel that zooming using CMD is the more used feature as most user have trackpads and all Apple mice support 2d scrolling.

751110715759616000,Thu Jul 07 17:48:44 +0000 2016,@jad_chaar I’m not sure what you mean with Spectacle. Do you mean the OS X Splitscreen mode? This should work also on 12”.
751110285969264600,Thu Jul 07 17:47:01 +0000 2016,@ScotsAdvocate You can use OPML to export to @OmniOutliner. @TextExpander is only supported on Mac.
751110119123980300,Thu Jul 07 17:46:22 +0000 2016,@johncatalano Would a feature to help focus on a certain part of a map help? We are considering this.

750716023872127000,Wed Jul 06 15:40:22 +0000 2016,@johncatalano Interesting. Right now the easiest way to do this would be by using copy&amp;paste into a new document.

746059726996275200,Thu Jun 23 19:17:54 +0000 2016,@andyngo No, this would be too complicated to do using AppleScript.
746059442299482100,Thu Jun 23 19:16:46 +0000 2016,@andyngo I just tested it and it works fine for me. Can you please check if you see the same issue  if you open the md file in TextEdit.
746058310240059400,Thu Jun 23 19:12:16 +0000 2016,@RyneBraun When you have a node selected and press enter it should create a new sibling node. Is this broken for you?
745970767897198600,Thu Jun 23 13:24:25 +0000 2016,@andyngo No, this only works with Reminders as it’s a system service. Things integration is export only.
745970651060645900,Thu Jun 23 13:23:57 +0000 2016,@lunar0 Looks like they are using CoreText. We can’t use it as it has other limitations.
745958676968648700,Thu Jun 23 12:36:22 +0000 2016,With MindNode for Mac &amp; iOS you can now send tasks directly to @OmniFocus. https://t.co/xGUeHkIL5s
745958026763448300,Thu Jun 23 12:33:47 +0000 2016,@lunar0 Unfortunately this is nothing we can fix. Apple needs to address this issue. TextEdit has the same issue. https://t.co/RyqK8ZbcVy

745646332791107600,Wed Jun 22 15:55:13 +0000 2016,@jankeesvw It’s export only so we always create a new project when you export again. What breaks is the link in the projects Notes field.
745636860626616300,Wed Jun 22 15:17:35 +0000 2016,@tedsvo We should be able to add this to external keyboard support, but I fear it would add too much noise to gesture input.
745635803032846300,Wed Jun 22 15:13:23 +0000 2016,@tedsvo I’m afraid not. Only if you detach them one by one. Need to check if delete a single node is supported on iOS on external keyboard
745634170186113000,Wed Jun 22 15:06:54 +0000 2016,@lunar0 Thank you for pointing this out. We will have a look at it.
745633565073883100,Wed Jun 22 15:04:29 +0000 2016,@tedsvo In this case we always attach them to a new main node. If you paste it into an other node it should attach it to this node.
745633408517349400,Wed Jun 22 15:03:52 +0000 2016,@simplicitybliss Yes the URL scheme is too limited at the moment. Only possible for OmniFocus as they recently improved URL scheme support
745633153197408300,Wed Jun 22 15:02:51 +0000 2016,@Abner_Ma Currently not planned, but we can look into it if @todoist  has AppleScript support.

742338522875580400,Mon Jun 13 12:51:10 +0000 2016,@poige When you close the app, all windows should restore automatically. Isn’t this working for you?
742338397952483300,Mon Jun 13 12:50:40 +0000 2016,@maxjensen You can 3-finger swipe left or right to fold a node. Just ensure Accessibility is turned off as it will interfere.
741359963927380000,Fri Jun 10 20:02:43 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen Holding space to drag isn't working for you? Why not scroll with the mouse wheel? Really fast with Apples Magic Mouse
741359435839361000,Fri Jun 10 20:00:37 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen you can swipe with 3-fingers to fold/unfold. Not prefect right now but should improve in 4.3
741359246068056000,Fri Jun 10 19:59:52 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen This is one aspect I never liked with other apps. I prefer to quickly create new nodes
741339997752676400,Fri Jun 10 18:43:23 +0000 2016,@menzj93 Every text character can have it’s own link. This allows you to add multiple links to a single node
741338898685669400,Fri Jun 10 18:39:01 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen If you hold the option key, you can use the node well for folding and unfolding. Hope this helps.
741338822491967500,Fri Jun 10 18:38:43 +0000 2016,@menzj93 Do you mean links to websites or file links?
741338640329101300,Fri Jun 10 18:37:59 +0000 2016,@InASightedWorld Thank you for your interest. Can you please send me a short email with your TestFlith Id. markus@ideasoncanvas.com thx.
740923230962257900,Thu Jun 09 15:07:18 +0000 2016,@amlau Can you please send it to markus@ideasoncanvas.com Thx. I think we fixed an arrow link crash recently.
740909404443299800,Thu Jun 09 14:12:22 +0000 2016,@Yoshimitsu09 You can disable Smart Layout to position all nodes manually.
740909341440610300,Thu Jun 09 14:12:07 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare Please let me us know how it goes!
740909304258170900,Thu Jun 09 14:11:58 +0000 2016,@glynthomas We are considering it, but not under development right now.
740909215678599200,Thu Jun 09 14:11:37 +0000 2016,@amlau No, sounds like a bug. Can you send us the FreeMind document that is causing this issue for you?
740613138396119000,Wed Jun 08 18:35:06 +0000 2016,@Niall_cspace Not at this time as we are about to end the beta.
740542885146308600,Wed Jun 08 13:55:57 +0000 2016,@Niall_cspace This feature is currently only available in the private beta test. /cc @villahwong
740542648411381800,Wed Jun 08 13:55:00 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare a bug with the Google Drive app.
740542592627134500,Wed Jun 08 13:54:47 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare The third party sharing provider extension of Box and OneDrive support opening MindNode documents so I guess this might be
740542451518210000,Wed Jun 08 13:54:13 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare I installed Google Drive to have a look at it and I ran into the same issue. Also when trying to use the sharing extension.
740104118900019200,Tue Jun 07 08:52:27 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare Does Google Drive support third party sharing extensions on iOS? If so it might work that changes are synced back
740103871301881900,Tue Jun 07 08:51:28 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen Can you please try the following hint: https://t.co/HbSOAHmhsQ
740099132111622100,Tue Jun 07 08:32:38 +0000 2016,@StuRobson What is your Workflow? Do you use our markdown export to get your data into @decksetapp?
739801464281935900,Mon Jun 06 12:49:48 +0000 2016,@villahwong Thank you. Should be possible, but for now we prefer this simpler solution.
739801095879467000,Mon Jun 06 12:48:20 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare Glad this helped. I hope Apple can fix issues like this soon.
739779105076465700,Mon Jun 06 11:20:57 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare strange. Can you check if you see an error in Console. Thx
739778668520689700,Mon Jun 06 11:19:13 +0000 2016,@yokimbo this is great to hear. Thank you!
739778506272481300,Mon Jun 06 11:18:34 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen I'm curious, what do you miss in MindNode? The web app or the multi user editing abilities?
739066123145117700,Sat Jun 04 12:07:49 +0000 2016,@NeilHinrichsen sounds like a MAS issue. Try to logout and back in or reboot the Mac. Hope this helps.
738463980486840300,Thu Jun 02 20:15:07 +0000 2016,@johncatalano It’s also really hard to do a real sync as the two representations are very different.
738463382249087000,Thu Jun 02 20:12:44 +0000 2016,@johncatalano We currently don’t support this as sometimes the Reminders API will add duplicate entries.
738462990433931300,Thu Jun 02 20:11:11 +0000 2016,@JeffreyGrowe Do you have an external keyboard? In this case Shift-CMD-K will switch to the note.
738047281019138000,Wed Jun 01 16:39:18 +0000 2016,@ljpuk Glad you like the change we have implemented in our iOS version.
738047008938680300,Wed Jun 01 16:38:13 +0000 2016,@johncatalano Glad you like it. With automatic you mean export of new tasks to Reminders?
737341424765685800,Mon May 30 17:54:29 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev QuickLook and when holding space, dragging the canvas with the mouse.
737309210531254300,Mon May 30 15:46:28 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev Not that I’m aware of. Have you tried rewiring the shortcut in System Preferences under Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts?
736904951570567200,Sun May 29 13:00:06 +0000 2016,@Lito_D We think it might be related to different reminders id on both platforms, but this is only a theory.
736904818397225000,Sun May 29 12:59:34 +0000 2016,@Lito_D We had reports of an issue with this workflow from an other user, but are sadly unable to reproduce this on our end.
736904146872336400,Sun May 29 12:56:54 +0000 2016,@martinjmckenna Can you please try to reboot your Mac. This should help in this case.
736904063003004900,Sun May 29 12:56:34 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare Not that we are aware of. At the moment we only export to Dropbox so this isn’t a great workflow for collaboration.
736903938528677900,Sun May 29 12:56:04 +0000 2016,@Lito_D Do you get this when you first sync the document using iOS and than again from Mac? Or also with Mac only workflows?
736617181547499500,Sat May 28 17:56:36 +0000 2016,@Lito_D do you see this with all documents? Do you use the same calendar store on both platforms?
736616997530808300,Sat May 28 17:55:52 +0000 2016,@ArnoudKok Yes, cross platform bundles are sadly not available on the Mac App Store.
736616848372949000,Sat May 28 17:55:16 +0000 2016,@jgordonshare We can look into it, but I have to be honest, all options aren't really good right now.
735897960148570100,Thu May 26 18:18:40 +0000 2016,RT @syberknight: @MzPaulaS OMG THANK YOU for that article @ https://t.co/5tGooUrwmV - it has TOTALLY helped me!!!
733591202671558700,Fri May 20 09:32:26 +0000 2016,@AutomatingData There is currently no shortcut for it, but this would be a great addition. I put this onto our roadmap!
733285338974720000,Thu May 19 13:17:03 +0000 2016,@thebrownarch I’d recommend using PDF export.
731143492341252100,Fri May 13 15:26:07 +0000 2016,@chrvietz Yes, it’s very high on our wish list for the next major update.
731140801842036700,Fri May 13 15:15:25 +0000 2016,@garc Could be a nice feature, but I fear with the current code too complicated. Will add it for consideration for the next major update.
731140215423815700,Fri May 13 15:13:05 +0000 2016,@neckdep I’m not sure I understand what you mean. Would you like to see deeper folder level? At the moment we only support one level.
730813607009787900,Thu May 12 17:35:16 +0000 2016,@Cottonsean Pro is the old version, MN2 the new one.
730813536214122500,Thu May 12 17:34:59 +0000 2016,@garc Interesting idea. Would you hide the entire tree structure as well?
730405078218223600,Wed May 11 14:31:55 +0000 2016,@iPaintCode Thank you!!
730405003224059900,Wed May 11 14:31:37 +0000 2016,@yeukang Yep, we implemented it today.
730404957132869600,Wed May 11 14:31:26 +0000 2016,@yeukang Thank you for the feedback. We will discuss this internally. In general this change is part of upcoming major changes in this area.
730036115852382200,Tue May 10 14:05:48 +0000 2016,@yeukang FYI If you use shift-drag from a node you can create connections a lot faster when working with the mouse.
730035977876607000,Tue May 10 14:05:15 +0000 2016,@yeukang …preferred line thickness and use “Extract Personal Theme” to create a default theme with your style.
730035874520567800,Tue May 10 14:04:50 +0000 2016,@yeukang We changed this a bit: 1. Disabling the auto setting for one map will disable it for all new maps 2. Create a document wit you…
730035053879808000,Tue May 10 14:01:34 +0000 2016,@yeukang Interesting feedback. I guess selecting the new node would probably be the right behavior.
730033447293571100,Tue May 10 13:55:11 +0000 2016,@shawnroos Do you mean to pick the system font as a node font? Apple doesn’t support this as it shouldn’t be used for non UI elements.
730033119584264200,Tue May 10 13:53:53 +0000 2016,@yeukang Yes, we are thinking about adding those features. Connection labels are already supported.
730033004811325400,Tue May 10 13:53:26 +0000 2016,@yeukang How would you configure it differently? Decrease by 2 instead of 1pt at a time?
730032867607232500,Tue May 10 13:52:53 +0000 2016,@yeukang Not sure I understand what you mean. Do you mean the connection label?
730032664783228900,Tue May 10 13:52:05 +0000 2016,@JigsawLearning No, you need to purchase both. The AppStore currently doesn’t support cross platform bundles.
729736967307530200,Mon May 09 18:17:05 +0000 2016,@RodChristiansen With Pencil support, do you mean scribbling on the canvas or attaching a scribbling to a node?
729736878216388600,Mon May 09 18:16:44 +0000 2016,@RodChristiansen Sorry for the misunderstanding, I don’t think the feature is an edge case, the implementation sadly has several.
728595318737121300,Fri May 06 14:40:35 +0000 2016,@RodChristiansen Sounds great, but would be a really big feature and if you consider the edge cases sadly pretty hard to do.
728595045528555500,Fri May 06 14:39:30 +0000 2016,@johncatalano I know what you mean, but without a web API to sync changes probably too hard to do.
727930366632284200,Wed May 04 18:38:18 +0000 2016,@davelegion This test is for the next feature release. The focus is to catch critical bugs and help improve accessibility.
727930149723869200,Wed May 04 18:37:26 +0000 2016,@tedsvo Do you mean iOS 9’s Open in Place functionality? I’m currently not aware of an other app supporting it, sorry.
727846114804781000,Wed May 04 13:03:31 +0000 2016,@SalamaAly Thank you. If you have any feedback, please let us know though the beta feedback channels.
727430406153375700,Tue May 03 09:31:38 +0000 2016,@macundschule Interessant. Muss ich mir anschauen. Danke für den Hinweis.
727429693700476900,Tue May 03 09:28:48 +0000 2016,@macundschule Ist das die AppStore version?
727424074851467300,Tue May 03 09:06:28 +0000 2016,@Identitycat Great. Thank you for giving it a try!
727424027531288600,Tue May 03 09:06:17 +0000 2016,@macundschule Wir haben leider noch keinen Weg gefunden das am Mac zu implementieren. Die OS X Sandbox blockiert dies leider.
727423499892101100,Tue May 03 09:04:11 +0000 2016,@eyeonannapolis Yes, we use iCloud Drive to sync documents between iOS and Mac.
727140341372096500,Mon May 02 14:19:01 +0000 2016,@eyeonannapolis You need to purchase both version separately. Cross platform bundles are sadly not supported by the App Store at the moment.
727140063943995400,Mon May 02 14:17:55 +0000 2016,@macundschule On iOS you can use  this: https://t.co/4ZbGN34nvK
726114185512362000,Fri Apr 29 18:21:27 +0000 2016,@codenix Sorry, we only did the discount in the first 2 months. I’d recommend you sign up for the newsletter to learn of future promos.
726114015383031800,Fri Apr 29 18:20:46 +0000 2016,@LuigiBenetton This is currently not supported in MindNode. As this is also the first time we hear this request, I’ll add it to our tracker
726058169609404400,Fri Apr 29 14:38:51 +0000 2016,@LuigiBenetton Not exactly sure what you are trying to do, but using `Cut` or reconnecting doesn’t help your use case?
726058000675397600,Fri Apr 29 14:38:11 +0000 2016,@codenix … the versions you have. Since relating MindNode 2 we tried to keep them as compatible as possible.
726057856571564000,Fri Apr 29 14:37:37 +0000 2016,@codenix If you are unsure, you can try our demo: https://t.co/H02tdZqnUh and if you don’t need the new feature you can stick with …
725943885331988500,Fri Apr 29 07:04:44 +0000 2016,@LuigiBenetton You can create a connection between the two nodes. On Mac simply hold shift and drag a line between the two nodes
725943726288162800,Fri Apr 29 07:04:06 +0000 2016,@villahwong Thank you. I can reproduce the problem. We will look into it!
725943428165455900,Fri Apr 29 07:02:55 +0000 2016,@chrvietz Can you check if there is an error output in https://t.co/MLXM04KUaG
725353136618147800,Wed Apr 27 15:57:18 +0000 2016,@LeninRzSz https://t.co/qgWtJAlQcU ;-)
725352446059548700,Wed Apr 27 15:54:34 +0000 2016,@LeninRzSz Not at the moment, but I’ll add a reminder to look into it. Never looked at the file format to see if it’s easy to support.
725352103024189400,Wed Apr 27 15:53:12 +0000 2016,@LuigiBenetton Depends on what software they use. FreeMind export could help. Or you can send them a PDF or upload the doc to MyMindNode.
725351903626944500,Wed Apr 27 15:52:24 +0000 2016,@villahwong We are currently not aware of this issue. Can you always reproduce this? I tried and was unable to.
725351512428388400,Wed Apr 27 15:50:51 +0000 2016,@LeninRzSz Not that we are aware of, but Xmind appears to be popular on Windows and it can read FreeMind files MindNode exports.
724904941656100900,Tue Apr 26 10:16:20 +0000 2016,@chrvietz Glad to hear rebooting helped!
724882893571547100,Tue Apr 26 08:48:44 +0000 2016,@chrvietz Could be a sandboxing issue. I recommend you reboot your Mac to see if it helps.
724859824106790900,Tue Apr 26 07:17:03 +0000 2016,@bau_giacomo If you need any help let us know. You can find our Mac Demo here: https://t.co/H02tdZ8N2J /cc @LeninRzSz @toketaWare
724477604225515500,Mon Apr 25 05:58:15 +0000 2016,@IKarthikI But it should be possible to pull this information very easily into a document.
724477522549837800,Mon Apr 25 05:57:56 +0000 2016,@IKarthikI Got it. Thank you for the clarification. So basically it’s a store of ideas that doesn’t have to be represented as a mind map.
723943485074710500,Sat Apr 23 18:35:51 +0000 2016,@IKarthikI Ah yes this makes more sense. In this case you would expect it to be added to a `default`document and attached to the main node?
723600422762623000,Fri Apr 22 19:52:39 +0000 2016,@IKarthikI can you share on what object you would add this quick add action? 3D Touch on the node?
723598594197053400,Fri Apr 22 19:45:23 +0000 2016,@Djillali I've added this as a feature request. We will try to get this into one of the next updates.
723214383652978700,Thu Apr 21 18:18:40 +0000 2016,@Djillali It already works, but it only indicates that a search term was found in a note of a node.
723214253587587100,Thu Apr 21 18:18:09 +0000 2016,@Djillali Interesting. Do you have so many long notes? One thing we want to improve is searching notes in the outline view.
723213302453682200,Thu Apr 21 18:14:22 +0000 2016,@Djillali Do you mean searching inside the note popover on Mac?
723151133217284100,Thu Apr 21 14:07:20 +0000 2016,@emilbjergjensen BTW a setting in the UI would change the same value as the Terminal command.
723150921102942200,Thu Apr 21 14:06:29 +0000 2016,@emilbjergjensen There are currently no plans for a public setting, but the changing it via Terminal should work fine.
723150589488697300,Thu Apr 21 14:05:10 +0000 2016,@chrvietz I’d recommend you mange your iCloud files in Finder on Mac. The open panel only has very limited functionally.
723150369136750600,Thu Apr 21 14:04:18 +0000 2016,(2/2) If you are interested, please apply for our beta test: https://t.co/qgWtJAlQcU
723150353307439100,Thu Apr 21 14:04:14 +0000 2016,(1/2) We are currently working on greatly improving accessibility in MindNode for iOS and would love to hear your feedback on our changes.
722840331906084900,Wed Apr 20 17:32:19 +0000 2016,@chrvietz Do you mean on iOS? You can move a document into a folder by tapping on the name and selecting “Move Document".
722766538323927000,Wed Apr 20 12:39:05 +0000 2016,@villahwong We are aware of this new @OmniFocus functionality and are looking into it.
722765867679944700,Wed Apr 20 12:36:25 +0000 2016,@tedsvo If you want to stay on the beta, I’d keep the current version installed. No need to update. There should be a new beta this week.
722765042505158700,Wed Apr 20 12:33:09 +0000 2016,@emilbjergjensen Please check the link I sent you yesterday. This should help.

722446781175488500,Tue Apr 19 15:28:29 +0000 2016,@eywu Thank you for the feedback. This is currently not planned, but we offer CSV import/export. Perhaps this helps?
721972810374123500,Mon Apr 18 08:05:06 +0000 2016,@itarjan I want to follow up on you data loss issue. Where you able to recover your document?
721380678168944600,Sat Apr 16 16:52:10 +0000 2016,@itarjan …locate deleted files under advanced and check if you see them there.

721380325948014600,Sat Apr 16 16:50:46 +0000 2016,@itarjan Can you please force quite the app and relaunch. If this doesn't help please check if you see the documents…
721378824966029300,Sat Apr 16 16:44:49 +0000 2016,@mattcassinelli Would you expect to create nodes like this or scribble on the canvas.
721378011463991300,Sat Apr 16 16:41:35 +0000 2016,@itarjan @mindnode Are nodes or the document missing? Are you storing your documents on iCloud?
721377862004129800,Sat Apr 16 16:40:59 +0000 2016,@itarjan I'm very sorry for this. We normally only so support emails on weekdays. Can you describe the data loss issue you experienced?

720704811847577600,Thu Apr 14 20:06:31 +0000 2016,@zachhjar Do you mean that you can open it in the trail version? With this version they open fine?
720665699065196500,Thu Apr 14 17:31:06 +0000 2016,@zachhjar Would it be possible to send us one of the broken documents? You can extract them using https://t.co/j0T5LIa4HN in a browser.

720663861548970000,Thu Apr 14 17:23:48 +0000 2016,@zachhjar do you use MindNode on an other device? If so do you see the same issue there?

720287439638683600,Wed Apr 13 16:28:02 +0000 2016,@jirizavadil We switched to it as it saves space and works better with split keyboard. Do you prefer the old solution?
720177221781090300,Wed Apr 13 09:10:04 +0000 2016,@jirizavadil You can enabled it by long pressing on the globe symbol on the keyboard
720177122074050600,Wed Apr 13 09:09:40 +0000 2016,@jirizavadil Ah sorry. Yes the keyboard accessory bar is also available on iPad. Please make sure you have predictive keyboard enabled.
719946942667694100,Tue Apr 12 17:55:01 +0000 2016,@jirizavadil our apps don't use a toolbar. What feature are you trying to find?
719946771846340600,Tue Apr 12 17:54:21 +0000 2016,@HollyweirdGrove This is currently not planned but we hope Apple adds collaboration to iCloud this year.
719946471173464000,Tue Apr 12 17:53:09 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev We feel our current task feature works great with MindNode's focused nature and don't want to add too much complexity
719946204348620800,Tue Apr 12 17:52:05 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev Thank you for sharing your feature idea. At the moment we have no plans to add more task related features.

718742962730090500,Sat Apr 09 10:10:50 +0000 2016,@sylumer This is correct, and we recently added the option to save a document as a single file. /cc @rosemaryorchard @WorkflowHQ
718713938758803500,Sat Apr 09 08:15:30 +0000 2016,@rosemaryorchard yes, it's just a bit slower during saving and iCloud upload
718712505024004100,Sat Apr 09 08:09:48 +0000 2016,@rosemaryorchard @WorkflowHQ might be related to our package file format. You can try to switch to single file format under File&gt;Advanced

717437741034766300,Tue Apr 05 19:44:21 +0000 2016,@Marco_van_loon Thank you for your interest in MindNode. The $29,99 app is the official one. The other is a copy of ours.
717436856493817900,Tue Apr 05 19:40:50 +0000 2016,@EdHans Thank you. I’ll have a look at it!
717057338570641400,Mon Apr 04 18:32:46 +0000 2016,@EdHans No. Are you aware of a great mind mapping app on Windows? Perhaps we could partner with them.
717057192160018400,Mon Apr 04 18:32:11 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev It would be easier, yes. But we would have to rewrite our entire sync code, for a not really perfect solution.
716683394789339100,Sun Apr 03 17:46:51 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev Ideally we hope Apple will support shared iCloud folders in the near future as a first step to enable this workflow
716683111631872000,Sun Apr 03 17:45:43 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev I fully understand what you mean and we hope we can bring this feature to the app in the future.
716357769432055800,Sat Apr 02 20:12:56 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev or do you mean work on the same document with others? This is currently not supported.
716357602993684500,Sat Apr 02 20:12:16 +0000 2016,@nikitavoloboev yes you can share for example a PDF or upload it to our MYMindNode web service.

710913423249383400,Fri Mar 18 19:39:02 +0000 2016,@DeweyNoordhof If you want to use the new features, yes. Otherwise you can continue to use Pro. We still ensure it works on newer Macs.

694532082752700400,Tue Feb 02 14:45:26 +0000 2016,@scott_lowe Not sure. We think it’s related to sandboxing. We save the same behavior with Pages files.

692704376843063300,Thu Jan 28 13:42:47 +0000 2016,@johncatalano One thing you can do is only show nodes with open tasks in the outline view.
692704251957608400,Thu Jan 28 13:42:18 +0000 2016,@johncatalano At the moment every document has it’s own dedicated list in Reminders.
692448176155029500,Wed Jan 27 20:44:44 +0000 2016,@johncatalano Sorry, currently not planned as it would make keeping the status in sync a lot harder. Do you only use one list?
692077212506427400,Tue Jan 26 20:10:40 +0000 2016,@scott_lowe In this case, open Terminal on your Mac and paste in the following command: https://t.co/eFMLVagad4
692075681447018500,Tue Jan 26 20:04:35 +0000 2016,@Colmanetg Sorry there was a mistake in my last tweet. What I mean is that we sync the status between both apps.

691985975669489700,Tue Jan 26 14:08:07 +0000 2016,@Colmanetg Do you have other lists in Reminders? Do you use iCloud with Reminders?
691985285161287700,Tue Jan 26 14:05:23 +0000 2016,@KiloNiner You can export to reminders using the share menu. What issue are you seeing?
691985205603782700,Tue Jan 26 14:05:04 +0000 2016,@Colmanetg It should work automatically, but it only syncs status. Can you share what issue you are seeing?

672807713395601400,Fri Dec 04 16:00:33 +0000 2015,@thedamon Currently not supported but a work around is to upload to MyMindNode and add “.json” to the URL to dl a Json file.
672728206366101500,Fri Dec 04 10:44:37 +0000 2015,@JohnRHeaton We deployed a fix today. The too large “Request function” issue should now be resolved.

672167624239894500,Wed Dec 02 21:37:04 +0000 2015,@alkomy Thank you. I noticed you are from Cairo. By any chance, have you tried to use MindNode for iOS in Arabic?
672095638717399000,Wed Dec 02 16:51:01 +0000 2015,@SamFielding91 Your main use for this feature would be during a presentation?
672093713150124000,Wed Dec 02 16:43:22 +0000 2015,@SamFielding91 We think that this is probably most helpful during a presentation so we consider this as a feature.
672093560162881500,Wed Dec 02 16:42:46 +0000 2015,@SamFielding91 We considered it, but the mixed state of some folded and some unfolded node on the same level is difficult to get “right”.
672093036730523600,Wed Dec 02 16:40:41 +0000 2015,@shawnroos Nativ Markdown support in notes is currently not planned, but I’ll add your +1. Thank you!

671714336310710300,Tue Dec 01 15:35:52 +0000 2015,@ryankiek The issue is the iOS document picker. So if you use https://t.co/1g9LotSL6y or https://t.co/g2YWtReRAP it should work fine.
671711877194494000,Tue Dec 01 15:26:05 +0000 2015,@ryankiek The underlying issue is that we can’t use the same picker for opening MindNode files and importing other files.
671711597220466700,Tue Dec 01 15:24:59 +0000 2015,@ryankiek In this case please use the https://t.co/g2YWtReRAP. The in-app picker sadly only supported MindNode files.

671708576411476000,Tue Dec 01 15:12:59 +0000 2015,@thomasmichel_ Currently not. What would be your use case for a collaboration feature?
671708335553577000,Tue Dec 01 15:12:01 +0000 2015,@rajannk If you upload the document, just add .json to the URL and you can get a json representation.

669954034246094800,Thu Nov 26 19:01:03 +0000 2015,@JohnRHeaton We are still learning how to best bring MindNode to the web. This is why we still label MyMindNode as beta.

657555893081538600,Fri Oct 23 13:55:16 +0000 2015,@kaza_rinko Thank you. We are able to reproduce this issue on our side, but so far we sadly haven’t found a fix.
657456858979004400,Fri Oct 23 07:21:44 +0000 2015,@xnwkac This makes sense and this is definitely a bug on our end. We will try to get this fixed asap. Sorry for this annoyance.
657456388411686900,Fri Oct 23 07:19:52 +0000 2015,@TanselAli there are currently no plans for a Windows version. Our focus is on Mac and iOS at the moment.
657456073989820400,Fri Oct 23 07:18:37 +0000 2015,@kaza_rinko Thank you for the bug report. Can you share what version of iOS you are using and what Chinese input system. Thx
657219013689389000,Thu Oct 22 15:36:38 +0000 2015,@xnwkac Do you see this issue on Mac or iOS? On Mac it's a bug. On iOS you can swipe down to get into view mode.
657200907386552300,Thu Oct 22 14:24:41 +0000 2015,@jaspervp Apple has a Volume Purchase Program. It's sadly limited to only a few countries: https://t.co/imOFgGHp80

656541797376749600,Tue Oct 20 18:45:37 +0000 2015,@GautierMichelin We just deployed a fix for this issue. It should now work correctly on the Desktop (on touch devices only pinch works atm)
656395908519743500,Tue Oct 20 09:05:54 +0000 2015,@TanselAli You can try to ask Apple for a refund. Or if you both have Family Sharing enabled, you both should be able to use the app.
656395102194147300,Tue Oct 20 09:02:42 +0000 2015,@GautierMichelin Thank you for the bug report. This is currently a known issue and we are working on a fix. Sorry about this!

652911837105799200,Sat Oct 10 18:21:27 +0000 2015,@the_sambinator Depending on your device, Slide-Over might work. Split screen only works on newer iPads.
652911742943674400,Sat Oct 10 18:21:04 +0000 2015,@lik0n Das hängt sehr von den Anforderungen an. Wir legen sehr grossen Fokus auf gute Interaktion und intuitive Bedienung.

652910373339840500,Sat Oct 10 18:15:38 +0000 2015,@dragonvet This is due to MindNode and Keynote conforming to the same base UTI and Keynote not supporting Open in Place.
652888759499911200,Sat Oct 10 16:49:45 +0000 2015,@the_sambinator Yes. All versions starting with 2.1 support split screen. http://t.co/PeTYPYw5xo

652888198587269100,Sat Oct 10 16:47:31 +0000 2015,@bonlait Really depends on what app you are working on Window. The Freemind export format is probably the best for most other apps.

646603447018618900,Wed Sep 23 08:34:09 +0000 2015,@Berylium Do you mean a top-down layout style as this would fit better for an org chart?
646602956129869800,Wed Sep 23 08:32:12 +0000 2015,@fetishforcode Glad you like the demo. If you have any questions, let me know!
646322676789813200,Tue Sep 22 13:58:28 +0000 2015,We have several updates in the pipeline for this fall. Our iOS 9 update will ship first. http://t.co/cTP4tLrcyE http://t.co/3vv7UDW85I
646253666467496000,Tue Sep 22 09:24:15 +0000 2015,@markkaintz Thank you for your interest in sharing your ideas. You can reach us at support@mindnode.com Cheers! /cc @heckmueller
646253207929417700,Tue Sep 22 09:22:26 +0000 2015,@JoshuaPoehls Yes. We already shipped our iOS 9 update to Apple and it’s currently waiting for approval.
646253023665225700,Tue Sep 22 09:21:42 +0000 2015,@HenrySchaffrath This issue should be resolved. Are you using MindNode on iOS or Mac and what version do you have installed?
646252800805064700,Tue Sep 22 09:20:49 +0000 2015,@MBerazaluce We recently released 1.11.4 that resolves El Capitan issues. You can update by redownloading the app from the Purchases Tab.
646252486714638300,Tue Sep 22 09:19:34 +0000 2015,@MBerazaluce MindNode 2 is a paid upgrade and sadly the MAS doesn’t support discounts for loyal customers. http://t.co/VtqPv6zPKT
645931091354751000,Mon Sep 21 12:02:27 +0000 2015,@HenrySchaffrath Do you mean the level 1 nodes as they are currently clockwise around the main node?
645930913117917200,Mon Sep 21 12:01:45 +0000 2015,@allanwhite I definitely agree that it would be a nice features. We have some ideas, but for now Cross Connection are a good work around.
644583464528953300,Thu Sep 17 18:47:28 +0000 2015,@CSArunagiri The branch thickness is a user default and not stored with the theme.We currently have no UI to set it but it’s planned for 2.1
644583026182201300,Thu Sep 17 18:45:43 +0000 2015,@allanwhite This is something mind maps in general don’t support. You can work around it using a cross connection.
643797933519958000,Tue Sep 15 14:46:03 +0000 2015,@AbramKJ Yes. This should work. If you find an issue, let us know.
643793411603042300,Tue Sep 15 14:28:05 +0000 2015,@AbramKJ Markdown import is currently not supported but on our list for later this year.
643449243437518800,Mon Sep 14 15:40:29 +0000 2015,@bibistrikesback … you stick with MindNode Pro. We ensured it works fine on El Capitan.
643449136600252400,Mon Sep 14 15:40:03 +0000 2015,@bibistrikesback Do you mean the MindNode 2 upgrade? Developing new features sadly costs money. If you don’t need them I’d recommend…
643111762506739700,Sun Sep 13 17:19:27 +0000 2015,@Cerebral_Ramble This is sadly a bug in 2.0.5. We already submitted 2.0.6 with the fix. Sorry about this glitch!
642410146463879200,Fri Sep 11 18:51:28 +0000 2015,@philipyoungg This is a known issue when you create a new main node. We will have a fix in the next update. Sorry about this!
642410038284431400,Fri Sep 11 18:51:03 +0000 2015,@fbzga Unfortunately there is no upgrade discount. Apple doesn’t support them on the Mac App Store.
642409900363116500,Fri Sep 11 18:50:30 +0000 2015,@fbzga You can redownload MindNode 1 from the App Store. You can find it on the “Purchases” tab.
642409752346132500,Fri Sep 11 18:49:55 +0000 2015,@mjuniorr2 You can add any cliparts from your disk by dragging them onto the canvas.
642319687725006800,Fri Sep 11 12:52:01 +0000 2015,@mjuniorr2 We plan to ship two free sticker sets within the next 1-2 months.
