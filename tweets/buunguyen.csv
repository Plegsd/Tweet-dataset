804191754974965800,Thu Dec 01 05:13:50 +0000 2016,@Crashbell async/await certainly makes it more difficult to screw up, but callback hell should never happen in well-structured code.

804043179922100200,Wed Nov 30 19:23:27 +0000 2016,If you already setup Babel, it wouldn't take much to add async/await. Do it. You won't regret. Can't live without this since forever.

255523768045273100,Tue Oct 09 04:23:08 +0000 2012,@unclebobmartin that helps specify what the code does and how it does that; but not *why* it has to do it and/or do it that way
255362852465025020,Mon Oct 08 17:43:43 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto got you, thanks :)
255352886622568450,Mon Oct 08 17:04:07 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto got you; check this out, ignore some comments in the ctor, I think other comments are necessary http://t.co/mYx5o6DH
255351329789198340,Mon Oct 08 16:57:55 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto I think now it becomes subjective, because given the situation I'd rather see a comment than a var
255350136601997300,Mon Oct 08 16:53:11 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto agreed completely, I'm all for clear code/less comment, but I'm arguing that comments are useful to describe the why's of the code
255349111732203520,Mon Oct 08 16:49:07 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto original code doesn't have an ivar, now it does, just to get rid of one line of comment; what kind of refactors remove comments?
255347979504984060,Mon Oct 08 16:44:37 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto need a dummy ivar/var, kind of a hack don't you think? isn't it easier just to comment code in that case?

255343143220822000,Mon Oct 08 16:25:24 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto @unclebobmartin @H9RBSjs example: // use CIL generation here to avoid too many reflection calls (measured to be slow)
255342683764170750,Mon Oct 08 16:23:34 +0000 2012,@JaviSoto @unclebobmartin @H9RBSjs that looks more like a 'what', why did you have to make xx compatible and why did you do it that way?
255338016485302270,Mon Oct 08 16:05:01 +0000 2012,@unclebobmartin @JaviSoto @H9RBSjs how can you communicate the why's of your code without comment?

253198226482679800,Tue Oct 02 18:22:16 +0000 2012,@ubolonton TS is closer to (a piece of) Dart than anything else; must less ambitious &amp; lower barrier but ppl may like it for exactly that

1611882623,Sat Apr 25 10:10:04 +0000 2009,@leduytien yeah, that could work in some cases; as in my case, I'm expecting add-on, so can't control names;

1611759174,Sat Apr 25 09:27:54 +0000 2009,@leduytien so I meant it should be part of the reflection API (as with .NET) so that we don't have to belabor on it
1611756286,Sat Apr 25 09:26:55 +0000 2009,@leduytien yeah, that's possible, but then if the classes are packaged in some jar then need to unzip it and scan...

1359061558,Fri Mar 20 06:49:43 +0000 2009,@dshupp rails doesn't use jQuery for its ajax function though (not sure about django), but again one can simply drop jquery in and use
1359055330,Fri Mar 20 06:47:07 +0000 2009,@dshupp "...how..." - jQuery is a pure client-side library, so basically it can be dropped in and used regardless of server-side technology
1359028893,Fri Mar 20 06:36:50 +0000 2009,@duylam the overlap should be removed - and the other asp.net ajax offer (like client-side template) should be built on top of jquery
1359026193,Fri Mar 20 06:35:44 +0000 2009,@duylam there are a lot of overlapping between the two, inc. both DOM selection/manipulation and Ajax support
1358956614,Fri Mar 20 06:09:07 +0000 2009,asp.net ajax should be built based on jquery (i.e. as plugin) - a separate api is no good
