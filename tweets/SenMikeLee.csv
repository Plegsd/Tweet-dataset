1007502235729735700,Fri Jun 15 05:57:06 +0000 2018,Anyone who doesn’t want the Senate to pass the Due Process Guarantee Act enjoys the smell one experiences near a dog food factory.

1007419734369931300,Fri Jun 15 00:29:16 +0000 2018,By contrast, imagine the immense harm that could come from a law that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens!
1007419372909006800,Fri Jun 15 00:27:50 +0000 2018,Where is the harm in a law saying that Americans can’t be indefinitely detained without charge or trial on US soil?
1007418990120095700,Fri Jun 15 00:26:18 +0000 2018,Our govt isn’t now indefinitely detaining US citizens without charge or trial. But why leave a law in place that purports to authorize that?
1007416770016182300,Fri Jun 15 00:17:29 +0000 2018,Why would anyone who voted for a nearly identical version of the DPGA in 2012 now deny his colleagues the right to cast this vote?
1007416118913437700,Fri Jun 15 00:14:54 +0000 2018,Why block such a vote, especially when 68 senators wanted to take that vote?
1007415885781524500,Fri Jun 15 00:13:58 +0000 2018,Why would a senator object to letting the Senate even VOTE on whether to protect Americans’ due process rights?
1007415360021295100,Fri Jun 15 00:11:53 +0000 2018,Why would anyone choose to vote against a bill restoring existing constitutional protections that have been undermined by a bad law?
1007414657592778800,Fri Jun 15 00:09:05 +0000 2018,Had we voted on the DPGA, it would have passed, protecting the due process rights of hundreds of millions of American citizens.
1007414306982461400,Fri Jun 15 00:07:42 +0000 2018,The DPGA should have received a vote in the Senate.  A total of 68 senators voted against a motion to table the DPGA; they wanted a vote!
1007413757390225400,Fri Jun 15 00:05:31 +0000 2018,The DPGA, which I authored along with @SenFeinstein, was pending as an amendment to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.

1007411510057099300,Thu Jun 14 23:56:35 +0000 2018,The American people cannot be asked to wait another moment before their due process rights are protected by the Due Process Guarantee Act.

1007410262188740600,Thu Jun 14 23:51:37 +0000 2018,@SenFeinstein and I introduced the DPGA in 2012. It passed with 67 votes, but was somehow removed from the NDAA before final passage.
1007407990251622400,Thu Jun 14 23:42:36 +0000 2018,The DPGA was made necessary by Sec. 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, which purported to give the government unrestrained power to detain Americans.
1007406485763166200,Thu Jun 14 23:36:37 +0000 2018,The Due Process Guarantee Act would protect U.S. citizens on U.S. soil from being detained indefinitely without charge, counsel, or trial.

350320647186038800,Thu Jun 27 18:32:05 +0000 2013,I support immigration reform. But #Go8 is not immigration reform. It is big government dysfunction. I am voting no: http://t.co/0Rx1s0lT78
350319618340032500,Thu Jun 27 18:28:00 +0000 2013,There's simply no legitimate reason why we have to pass a one-size-fits-all 1,200-page, take-it-or-leave-it #immigration bill.
350319320229883900,Thu Jun 27 18:26:49 +0000 2013,the only reason #immigration reform is so controversial is because the Senate refuses to pass it one piece at a time.
350318983842504700,Thu Jun 27 18:25:29 +0000 2013,The House appears to have learned from #Go8 dysfunction and wants no part of this.  They are passing step-by-step reforms.
350317941323087900,Thu Jun 27 18:21:20 +0000 2013,The special interests had a huge hand in writing the #Go8 bill while the American people had no role: http://t.co/1XCVo3oPh5
350317313234440200,Thu Jun 27 18:18:50 +0000 2013,The so-called comprehensive approach has been utterly discredited. #Go8 bill reaffirms why vast majority of Americans distrust Washington.
350316706117337100,Thu Jun 27 18:16:25 +0000 2013,The #Go8 process has revealed all the problems inherent in passing massive pieces of legislation that try to fix all of problems at once.
350283724056825860,Thu Jun 27 16:05:22 +0000 2013,For grand finale, the #Go8 proponents substituted what is effectively a brand-new bill instead of the one we've been debating for 2 months.
350282976036270100,Thu Jun 27 16:02:24 +0000 2013,For a 1,200-page bill we were allowed exactly nine roll call votes to amend #Go8 before the process was shut down.
350282295355248640,Thu Jun 27 15:59:41 +0000 2013,They said there would be regular order for #Go8 on the floor of the senate, but that turned out to be a false promise as well.
350281982548258800,Thu Jun 27 15:58:27 +0000 2013,During committee markup Democrats &amp; #Go8 Republicans voted as a block to defeat virtually all substantive amendments to improve the bill.
350281458822299650,Thu Jun 27 15:56:22 +0000 2013,We were told that if we didn't like what was in #Go8 that we'd have an opportunity to fix it. But that wasn't true either.
350281142202675200,Thu Jun 27 15:55:06 +0000 2013,From day one, the country was misled about what was in #Go8 bill. The talking points never matched bill's reality: http://t.co/8uM7N7bSFY
350280400951705600,Thu Jun 27 15:52:10 +0000 2013,As a matter of process, senators should be embarrassed about how #Go8 bill has moved through the senate. http://t.co/ADQzNcmdHx
350279305495973900,Thu Jun 27 15:47:48 +0000 2013,According to CBO, #Go8 will reduce illegal immigration by just a mere 25% over the next ten years: reason alone to scrap entire bill.
350277411453141000,Thu Jun 27 15:40:17 +0000 2013,The #Go8 bill transfers too much authority &amp; discretion to the executive branch, exacerbating an already widespread problem in federal gov.
350276680209809400,Thu Jun 27 15:37:23 +0000 2013,The #Go8 bill remains grossly unfair to those who have languished in our current legal immigration system for decades.
350276310741950460,Thu Jun 27 15:35:54 +0000 2013,The #Go8 bill cuts the American people out by cutting out congressional oversight of pathway to citizenship process: http://t.co/crWlm7SzM7

350274829057925100,Thu Jun 27 15:30:01 +0000 2013,As a matter of public policy, #Go8 fails to meet many of the goals that we set to meet at the beginning of the process.
350274609473531900,Thu Jun 27 15:29:09 +0000 2013,The #Go8 bill we have before us today is an enormous disappointment. The American people deserve better: http://t.co/mLTfzGCHwz
