852840605113696300,Fri Apr 14 11:06:59 +0000 2017,@desibxtch but how is that a race issue. That is a social issue. I am only trying to say that this is not a race issue. Don‚Äôt make it one
852840367166705700,Fri Apr 14 11:06:03 +0000 2017,@ChandanaArval But it is a pro choice argument. it was never about racism
852839999636504600,Fri Apr 14 11:04:35 +0000 2017,@ChandanaArval Exactly. I am not saying its right, Im just saying its not racism

852833863285956600,Fri Apr 14 10:40:12 +0000 2017,@ranveersbabe it‚Äôs wrong to be judged on it but how is it wrong if you use out of your own choice. Right or wrong u shuld have dat choice
852831392773709800,Fri Apr 14 10:30:23 +0000 2017,@Satwik07 then that‚Äôs a social issue. Go and start an awareness program. Don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs racism just to make a point
852829209248399400,Fri Apr 14 10:21:42 +0000 2017,On fairness creams. If you need to use it, do it. It‚Äôs not a race issue, it‚Äôs a self esteem issue. Don‚Äôt do it if you think you are fine!
