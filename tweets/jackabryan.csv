161894790999453700,Tue Jan 24 19:35:00 +0000 2012,By not nominating Shame or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy the Oscar for best picture is extremely loud and incredibly close to irrelevance.

86936357498388480,Fri Jul 01 23:16:57 +0000 2011,Back of a bumpy, four hour jitney ride. Every time my eyes close someone smacks my legs with the bathroom door. Cranky like a tired child.
86904547682942980,Fri Jul 01 21:10:33 +0000 2011,If you have seen transformers 3 and not midnight in paris or tree of life we have nothing to talk about. Ever.
