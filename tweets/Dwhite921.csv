610282842585587700,Mon Jun 15 03:09:02 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 not like mozgov and Thompson are offensive threats
610282213062541300,Mon Jun 15 03:06:32 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 delly spaces the floor which gives Lebron more space to operate
610281776737484800,Mon Jun 15 03:04:48 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 so who does mozgov guard?
610280865617219600,Mon Jun 15 03:01:11 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 I mean steph hit tough shots and if Lebron guards steph who does delly guard?
610280189457662000,Mon Jun 15 02:58:30 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 no maybe a possession or two but you can't make him do everything on both ends
610279602682880000,Mon Jun 15 02:56:10 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 Lebron one of the best defenders in the game. He has to rest on defense if he wants to carry the team offensively
610278863864594400,Mon Jun 15 02:53:14 +0000 2015,@MattMcKnight33 yeah obviously but you can't blame Lebron for them losing
610278589687181300,Mon Jun 15 02:52:08 +0000 2015,@DrewJamison05 you want him to run around all the screens and carry the team on offense? Stop it
