648921929437442000,Tue Sep 29 18:06:59 +0000 2015,@_techCEO yes. the A from 2 years ago is the same as a seed today. And that's an issue for folks who raised 2 years ago - not enough runway.

648912253287186400,Tue Sep 29 17:28:32 +0000 2015,7/ Where does the carousel stop?
648912194134896600,Tue Sep 29 17:28:17 +0000 2015,6/ We‚Äôll see Series B companies bridging to a Series C,  Series C bridging to a Series D, and so on.
648912157996773400,Tue Sep 29 17:28:09 +0000 2015,5/ It's obvious this effect is going to ripple through to later financing rounds.
648912101625323500,Tue Sep 29 17:27:55 +0000 2015,4/ In each case, the goal of the bridge round is to enable them to get to a Series B, where the hurdle is now $5-10M+ annualized revenues.
648911993420705800,Tue Sep 29 17:27:30 +0000 2015,3/ In the past couple weeks, I‚Äôve spoken to three companies who are raising a bridge round a year or two after raising a $5M+ Series A.
648911950714265600,Tue Sep 29 17:27:19 +0000 2015,2/ Back in the good ol‚Äô days (2013), a bridge round was intended to give post-seed companies more runway to get to a Series A.
648911926387277800,Tue Sep 29 17:27:14 +0000 2015,1/ One unintended but interesting consequence of the higher bar for later rounds is the changing nature of bridge rounds.
