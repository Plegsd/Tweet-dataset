811112356738637800,Tue Dec 20 07:33:50 +0000 2016,@arunchandrac So this is how you end a discussion. "Did I invite you to comment?" OK! Point taken. LOL @chhavi

811112007147589600,Tue Dec 20 07:32:26 +0000 2016,@arunchandrac You missed the point completely. I drew the "everywhere" parallel, because you blamed it on sexual repression. @chhavi

811110824429359100,Tue Dec 20 07:27:44 +0000 2016,@arunchandrac Nationalism? You brought up the term "sexually repressive country" to justify the act. And I am a nationalist? @chhavi
811110647132024800,Tue Dec 20 07:27:02 +0000 2016,@arunchandrac When you defend an act, you speak for them. Isn't that how it works? @chhavi
811109569791488000,Tue Dec 20 07:22:45 +0000 2016,@arunchandrac What about the same happening in so-called "sexually liberal" nations? This is not unique to India, for sure. @chhavi
811109324172955600,Tue Dec 20 07:21:47 +0000 2016,@arunchandrac So sexual repression entitles you to molest a passerby for gratification? @chhavi

807916471430938600,Sun Dec 11 11:54:31 +0000 2016,Being in a relationship has nothing to do with it. Casual, non-exclusive relationships are fine as well, as long as both parties are aware.
807916286818717700,Sun Dec 11 11:53:47 +0000 2016,Don't let personal opinions twist your comprehension of the topic. Feminism is about not being a misogynist and vanquishing your prejudice.
807915464110153700,Sun Dec 11 11:50:31 +0000 2016,Feminism means considering women as equal in every aspect, that is where the definition ends.

802043510845149200,Fri Nov 25 06:57:28 +0000 2016,When I meet you under official capacity, your first question should definitely not be "Have you put on weight?"   Kya karoge jaan ke?

802040720475336700,Fri Nov 25 06:46:23 +0000 2016,Misinterpretation is a conscious concept. In the subconscious, everyone knows what you mean. It's the conscious mask, and it doesn't matter.

802037775046316000,Fri Nov 25 06:34:41 +0000 2016,.@rogueindisguise Rants make sense when someone listens, affirms or responds. They're pointless otherwise.

801901834805776400,Thu Nov 24 21:34:30 +0000 2016,With this I end my rant. Thanks for reading, you've all been a great audience.
801901704186712000,Thu Nov 24 21:33:59 +0000 2016,These three core data points are enough to satiate my requirements as an investor. And they should be something you pay attention on.
801901546233425900,Thu Nov 24 21:33:21 +0000 2016,I don't care if you're from IIT or IIM or a small-town college dropout, all it matters to me is your product, its potential, and your zeal.
801901330189013000,Thu Nov 24 21:32:30 +0000 2016,You don't define the entire startup ecosystem. You're one team.
801901184671809500,Thu Nov 24 21:31:55 +0000 2016,Similarly, if your idea is amazing, or if it's a bunch of guys who think everyone should fall at their feet and just throw money on them...
801900505479802900,Thu Nov 24 21:29:13 +0000 2016,But either ways, I don't define the entire investment subculture. I am just one person or one AIF. I am not everybody.
801900323761582100,Thu Nov 24 21:28:30 +0000 2016,If I am an arrogant asshole, I'll ask you to fuck right off.
801900217737936900,Thu Nov 24 21:28:05 +0000 2016,I am investor and I will protect my interests. If I am a nice guy, I'll tell you what is wrong with your idea.
801899761913634800,Thu Nov 24 21:26:16 +0000 2016,If you have a strong team put together, the collective efforts matter. The product then becomes obsolete, the team takes paramountcy.
801899501057232900,Thu Nov 24 21:25:14 +0000 2016,If it is not working, don't necessarily wind up. Try pivoting. Snapdeal was a groupon's clone, it is now an amazon/flipkart clone.
801899311923535900,Thu Nov 24 21:24:29 +0000 2016,You need to know that no one can put you down. Not an investor, not your peers, not your competition. But be rational about your business.
801898976152686600,Thu Nov 24 21:23:09 +0000 2016,And comparisons se koi startup nahi banta. So a "Facebook for Photographers" is worthless, but a "Photography Social Network" may be worthy.
801898686007476200,Thu Nov 24 21:21:59 +0000 2016,You need data, prospects, feasibility, competition analysis and everything else in there. Emotions pe koi paise nahi lagata.
801898478087512000,Thu Nov 24 21:21:10 +0000 2016,So have patience, keep working on your idea and keep soliciting investors. A product alone will rarely get you money.
801898276391764000,Thu Nov 24 21:20:22 +0000 2016,If you walk out of a meeting and use words like "Chutiya aadmi hai, kuch samjha hi nahi isko!" Chances are that the chutiya knows already.
801897973269471200,Thu Nov 24 21:19:10 +0000 2016,And for the love of god, please know that the world is a very small. An absolutely contraction. And people talk.
801897716741652500,Thu Nov 24 21:18:08 +0000 2016,Contrary to popular belief, angel investors are not "real angels". They invest because they intend to derive a profit, they invest in future
801897442539016200,Thu Nov 24 21:17:03 +0000 2016,Also, no investor is going to go ahead and hand you a cheque in your very first meeting. Especially, when you've got nothing to show for it.
801897132365971500,Thu Nov 24 21:15:49 +0000 2016,At the very least, justify it and back it up with whatever prospects you have.
801896993089933300,Thu Nov 24 21:15:16 +0000 2016,When you're demanding a certain amount of cash, to support your idea which could propel it to a full blown company or a shuttered shop
801896094644875300,Thu Nov 24 21:11:42 +0000 2016,Have some numbers to backup your claims? A very minuscule feasibility study, maybe? Or at the very least a simple SWOT analysis?
801895783087755300,Thu Nov 24 21:10:27 +0000 2016,As a prospective investor, I don't expect you to be well-versed in most startup-esque jargons, but at least know what you're pitching?
801895516606865400,Thu Nov 24 21:09:24 +0000 2016,Their idea was to build a "Facebook for Photographers" - their words not mine. And the team had very obviously not done their HW.
801895258178977800,Thu Nov 24 21:08:22 +0000 2016,Had a meeting with an Indore-based startup today, they required help to get their initial MVP development going.

801864542976241700,Thu Nov 24 19:06:19 +0000 2016,All because, I asked her to "be careful"?
801864409773506600,Thu Nov 24 19:05:47 +0000 2016,I told her this was "creepy"! She thinks it's "sweet"! Then went on to defend the shit out of him, making me the bad guy somehow.

801863988111777800,Thu Nov 24 19:04:07 +0000 2016,Today, he slowly approached said friend when they left from office and offered again. Frnd said that she needed to buy groceries...

801371270117998600,Wed Nov 23 10:26:14 +0000 2016,@priyankawriting Yep, there are blogs and sites which quote launch times. They may not be as popular or mainstream, but they're there.

801360852519632900,Wed Nov 23 09:44:50 +0000 2016,@priyankawriting So Galaxy S7 becomes an old version and slowly exits the market, when Galaxy S8 is launched.

801360492413517800,Wed Nov 23 09:43:24 +0000 2016,@priyankawriting With non-flagship electronics, the manufacturer makes the launch details obscure, the product exit is equally obscure.

784322811342893000,Fri Oct 07 09:21:44 +0000 2016,I called @ICICIBank @ICICIBank_Care and the IVR simply hung up on me saying "You have used too many attempts". SMH!
784322686075809800,Fri Oct 07 09:21:15 +0000 2016,So @ICICIBank @ICICIBank_Care - your EazyPay is now a convenient mode for scammers. It being all official and all.
784322482492743700,Fri Oct 07 09:20:26 +0000 2016,.@ICICIBank @ICICIBank_Care They made me search for EazyPay on Google, directed me to the website and asked me to enter a company name.
784322373021413400,Fri Oct 07 09:20:00 +0000 2016,When I refused to enter my credit card details, they offered to pay via @ICICIBank @ICICIBank_Care EazyPay!
784322155995508700,Fri Oct 07 09:19:08 +0000 2016,They then wanted me to pay INR 7999 using my credit card by connecting me to an IVR via conference. With the guy speaking over the IVR. SMH!
784321801597833200,Fri Oct 07 09:17:44 +0000 2016,They then took my approval and called me again on the pretext of having me speak to a "manager"
784321669095579600,Fri Oct 07 09:17:12 +0000 2016,Received a fraud call from "Credit Card Service Department". The guys claimed they were offering me a Benetton Watch, A trip and a wallet.

782980375769288700,Mon Oct 03 16:27:23 +0000 2016,@malharfilhaal Doctor did say it was easy because it was timely. Had she delayed it, the condition could've debilitated further.
782980202720669700,Mon Oct 03 16:26:42 +0000 2016,@malharfilhaal Turned out it was some issue with her nerves or something, went through a treatment and all was fine.
