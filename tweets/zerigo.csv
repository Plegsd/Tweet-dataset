18968519833,Tue Jul 20 04:38:47 +0000 2010,@tripwireapp You might try dropping one of the MX records to make room for other records. 2-3 is generally sufficient.

15163748596,Tue Jun 01 08:01:19 +0000 2010,@elliottcable Might make sense for us to run stats on how many GAFYD users we have though--see if we're missing something.
15163622356,Tue Jun 01 07:57:46 +0000 2010,@elliottcable Most folks run out of domains & queries before hosts (multi-service GAFYD users not-withstanding).

15163217631,Tue Jun 01 07:45:41 +0000 2010,Your point, especially in regard to GYFYD, is definitely noted though. We'll keep it in mind for future changes in our plans.
15163113371,Tue Jun 01 07:42:37 +0000 2010,@elliottcable Yes, if you have that many domains with bunches of records. The vast majority of domains have less than 10 records though.
15163018772,Tue Jun 01 07:39:51 +0000 2010,@elliottcable Fewer SRV/XMPP & MX records might (or might not) be an option for you too.
15162914531,Tue Jun 01 07:36:49 +0000 2010,@elliottcable While we give effectively 10 (to be averaged), you can use all 30 records for a single domain.
