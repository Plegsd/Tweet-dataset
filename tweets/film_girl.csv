1220868952881946600,Sat Jan 25 00:40:15 +0000 2020,@matvelloso Yup. 24 hours. And they can’t cancel a cancellation. And your connector stuff might break. But it’s fine.
1220868724569211000,Sat Jan 25 00:39:21 +0000 2020,My vine username was christina. It is very important for me to have consistency for my looping video followers @dhof
