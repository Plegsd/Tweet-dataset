595450223054295000,Tue May 05 04:49:30 +0000 2015,@jvposter I've got a q for you now...what do you think of vegas? Big recovery or no?
595449469253988400,Tue May 05 04:46:31 +0000 2015,@jvposter I think it's a new world...for China, HK &amp; Macau. There hasn't been a leader as powerful as Xi Jinping in a long time, if ever.
595448852729106400,Tue May 05 04:44:04 +0000 2015,@jvposter agree. It's not minor. That's why I called it stunning:)
595448696298340400,Tue May 05 04:43:26 +0000 2015,@jvposter yep, agree. Yet even yesterday saw some articles alleging macau had reached bottom...
595447825535668200,Tue May 05 04:39:59 +0000 2015,@jvposter right...adding a whole different element of uncertainty
595447687157133300,Tue May 05 04:39:26 +0000 2015,@jvposter and the scope of the corruption crackdown is unprecedented. If you aren't amazed you are unique even among chinese living out here
595447336425291800,Tue May 05 04:38:02 +0000 2015,@jvposter you can say that about any big market crash...people are always shocked by how bad it turns out to be
595446927283527700,Tue May 05 04:36:24 +0000 2015,@jvposter 39% is a stunningly large number whether or not some foresaw it
