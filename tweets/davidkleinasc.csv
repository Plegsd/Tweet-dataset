18706220635,Fri Jul 16 18:18:57 +0000 2010,@seanswee testing Alexa soon, side by side with MX. Within next couple of weeks.
18645967484,Fri Jul 16 01:10:03 +0000 2010,@seanswee going to shoot #RedState on the MX. Also may be using the Canon 5d and 7d.
18640871214,Thu Jul 15 23:49:12 +0000 2010,Red One MX holds up well and grades nicely in Lustre. But, with @davec555 on the machine I could probably have shot on a PXL-2000.
18489791471,Wed Jul 14 03:27:22 +0000 2010,@Photo_Tony we have 2 HD flips strapped into a 3D rig - get ready for the best fucking format ever.
18489575959,Wed Jul 14 03:24:03 +0000 2010,@siberianxkiss i don't own the footage, so you'll have to put up with my nonsense tweets for a while.
18489545801,Wed Jul 14 03:23:35 +0000 2010,@StellularUAFilm only tested so far. will update soon after putting footage through the Lustre.
18405187428,Tue Jul 13 03:05:17 +0000 2010,finally getting my grubby mits on my Red One MX footage in Lustre with my man @davec555 this week. Also some Canon 5d, 7d footage.
17846170283,Tue Jul 06 05:32:36 +0000 2010,RT @TheeRobertEvans: I feel somewhat qualified to tell you the The Last Airbender makes Ed Wood look like Fellini.
17846162449,Tue Jul 06 05:32:27 +0000 2010,RT @TheeRobertEvans: Enough with the fucking 3D already.
17763604025,Mon Jul 05 03:37:19 +0000 2010,@CGravesMasshole it might look like Zodiac mixed with Half Nelson, but I haven't figured the look out yet.
17763447911,Mon Jul 05 03:34:33 +0000 2010,@IanCorrigan Alexa tests look great, but haven't had my hands on one. That will be the real test.
17678557407,Sat Jul 03 21:40:53 +0000 2010,Solid, needed week in Big Sur with the girls. Diving into #RedState now. Camera tests, anyone? Red MX? Alexa? 7d? 5d? maybe all the above.
16663496847,Mon Jun 21 02:55:40 +0000 2010,@billwalshdp  lighting system?: @jeremygaffer  I would have to get my hands and eyes on it to have an opinion. Looks kind of dope, though.
16596632695,Sun Jun 20 05:32:06 +0000 2010,@billewoodruff, @jeremygaffer and all - watching club dailies from wednesday and couldn't be more pleased. thank you.
16161596625,Mon Jun 14 16:52:33 +0000 2010,@RyanInHollywood agree. The digital formats are getting much better, but there still isn't much that can come close to a 35mm neg.
16161483271,Mon Jun 14 16:50:40 +0000 2010,@azfilmgear Red One MX is the only way to shoot Red. What kind of glass do you have? I'm using Cooke S4's and Optimos right now.
16161433263,Mon Jun 14 16:49:53 +0000 2010,@cjcavins #RedState will be digital - and tapeless. Probably a Red One MX w/ Canon 5d/7d's backint it up. Maybe an Arri 235 in the truck...
16161383617,Mon Jun 14 16:49:04 +0000 2010,@allan_pat I have both 7D (PL mount) and a Nikon, but haven't shot side by side yet. Will check out your link when i get a minute.
16161344248,Mon Jun 14 16:48:24 +0000 2010,@EBrock1972 not sure. If you're shooting digital to save money, I say go tapeless - Red MX, Genesis w/ solid state recorder, et cetera.
16161287655,Mon Jun 14 16:47:29 +0000 2010,@siberianxkiss Righteous. Glad to hear - you beat me. I was 20 when we shot Clerks.
16102302882,Sun Jun 13 22:40:43 +0000 2010,@smosier and @thatkevinsmith made my jaw hurt at the improv. well done.
16102216922,Sun Jun 13 22:39:04 +0000 2010,@ThatKevinSmith Red One MX (crossing fingers for an Epic) for #RedState and also currently testing Canon 5D & 7D with PL mount. Images soon.
15716906157,Tue Jun 08 16:27:05 +0000 2010,@CGravesMasshole professionally, been training for RED STATE my entire career. Physically, been in training for two months.
15588136961,Sun Jun 06 23:37:51 +0000 2010,@jeremygaffer nobody puts the chasing amy color temp meter in a corner.
15571142361,Sun Jun 06 18:02:57 +0000 2010,@PierceOToole film for Universal. We've been asked not to tweet about it - so I'm only getting into technical aspects of our work.
15571044350,Sun Jun 06 18:01:05 +0000 2010,ASC clubhouse open again. My first time as a member with @davec555 yesterday afternoon. Impressive, understated renovation.
15444141082,Fri Jun 04 21:43:06 +0000 2010,@dreamoutloud front three teeth on the left are fake. a bridge. carnie blood runs through these veins.
15442527375,Fri Jun 04 21:06:32 +0000 2010,@Twiggystar I love the last shot of C2. Was the last thing we shot on that film and took me right back to the OG Clerks.
15442463724,Fri Jun 04 21:05:13 +0000 2010,@novice_ninja bring it. But I don't work for Pringles. I work for Kogi tacos and Hinano. So also bring THAT shit and you're on.
15442371284,Fri Jun 04 21:03:18 +0000 2010,Circus comes to downtown LA. Night EXT. Alley. Dance. Red One MX & Phantom. I'm the bald carnie with the light meter on no sleep.
15399812878,Fri Jun 04 07:28:10 +0000 2010,Phantom today, 350fps. Takes a bit of light.
15253054486,Wed Jun 02 13:59:40 +0000 2010,RIP Bill Fraker, ASC.
15252912069,Wed Jun 02 13:57:26 +0000 2010,The Red One MX is not a time machine. It cannot conquer the 1 1/2 hour time deficit from first half. Let's not repeat today...
14922431572,Fri May 28 17:55:27 +0000 2010,best thing about the Red One MX so far: metadata. Data ABOUT data.
14831427514,Thu May 27 12:37:06 +0000 2010,been driving the Red One MX for a week - she handles nicely. Highlights roll off well and she's comfortable at 800. Slo mo today, 3k and 2k.
14676026983,Tue May 25 06:22:36 +0000 2010,@jeremygaffer WORD.
14675681376,Tue May 25 06:13:13 +0000 2010,Red One MX is fucking CLEAN. So far I'm a big fan of this new sensor. Can't wait to color grade it with @davec555. (he'd say colour grade)
14596704526,Mon May 24 02:52:36 +0000 2010,with @jeremygaffer and @davec555 getting my back, this should go well. Red One MX seemed to do well at ISO 800 night ext. Will see tomorrow.
14358824536,Thu May 20 12:47:04 +0000 2010,@ctalden 1 of 30, roughly. Feature film. Been asked not to tweet about it so it'll just be tech / creative aspects - not project itself.
14358694801,Thu May 20 12:44:35 +0000 2010,@davidjmader - @smosier and I sounded smart? Thanks. Getter our nerd on with that commentary, I seem to remember.
14344069749,Thu May 20 06:12:42 +0000 2010,Day 1. Done. MX is a fine machine. Color grading - check. It's mine to fuck up.
14274690747,Wed May 19 04:42:06 +0000 2010,Train departs tomorrow. 29 days downtown LA on the Red One MX. If you don't get nervous before day one you're phoning it in.
14121326512,Sun May 16 21:37:03 +0000 2010,@BrentwGraham word. I hope all of your producer friends are listening.
14121308880,Sun May 16 21:36:38 +0000 2010,RT @BrentwGraham: @ThatKevinSmith I wanna work with @ThatDavidKlein !!!
14121275101,Sun May 16 21:35:50 +0000 2010,@HamiltonSeen not sure. have seen footage but haven't actually shot with the Alexa. Need to do my own side by each comparison.
14121239822,Sun May 16 21:35:01 +0000 2010,@jeremygaffer the WHOLE world? wow. thanks, cuz. get some rest and remember "WE are the train - THEY are the hobos"
14121188994,Sun May 16 21:33:49 +0000 2010,@NothingClean Thanks. I stand behind the look of that film. Personal favorite is still Zack & Miri.
13956463766,Fri May 14 04:28:11 +0000 2010,Also showed MX footage to @thatkevinsmith projected in 4k and he seemed to dig.
13956365575,Fri May 14 04:25:52 +0000 2010,Red One MX test footage = sexy and clean like @jeremygaffer. I'm a fan. Of our test footage and of @jeremygaffer.
13924675436,Thu May 13 17:14:36 +0000 2010,getting my grubby mits on Red MX footage in the Lustre today. 4k - 3k - 2k test.
13829825931,Wed May 12 03:53:04 +0000 2010,Red One MX test went well. Will have my hands on the footage in Lustre Thursday.
13796479484,Tue May 11 16:17:30 +0000 2010,@GardnerM85 need to do my own side by side testing. But Alexa dynamic range and resolution is impressive.
13765929065,Tue May 11 03:12:36 +0000 2010,First glance - Arri Alexa footage is pretty sexy.
13736702665,Mon May 10 17:02:21 +0000 2010,Looking at Arri Alexa footage this evening. Testing the Red MX sensor tomorrow for upcoming feature. Digital mayhem in LA.
13575372323,Fri May 07 23:21:12 +0000 2010,Tonight getting my @ThatKevinSmith on - http://viewaskew.com/events/hob  - my man.
