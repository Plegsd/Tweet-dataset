518542881951600640,Sat Oct 04 23:27:11 +0000 2014,@jhw120 ok. We just disagree on this. Which is fine. Respectful.
518493795785383940,Sat Oct 04 20:12:08 +0000 2014,@jhw120 I wrote too soon. I guess you can't resist getting personal - which doesn't advance your case at all. Sorry for that.
518493475231514600,Sat Oct 04 20:10:52 +0000 2014,@jhw120 thanks for sticking to the issues if there is disagreement, Jack. I respect your opinion and unlike others avoiding personal attack

510162768205742100,Thu Sep 11 20:27:36 +0000 2014,@LocTruong1969 my advice to all - don't rush to judgment based on anonymous sources that AP did not independently confirm. Mueller - facts.
510150607177793540,Thu Sep 11 19:39:17 +0000 2014,@LocTruong1969 @WakeOfWeek actually there are no confirmed facts on anything - including what tape was sent. Just anon sources
510033520014921700,Thu Sep 11 11:54:01 +0000 2014,@whpresscorps @davidfrum if this is true there should at least be considered US and western economic boycott of Turkey.

510032702670925800,Thu Sep 11 11:50:46 +0000 2014,@LannyDavis 4-does not mean I am defending NFL or anyone. Just want to wait for facts. AP reporter just confirmed he doesn't have them. TY.
510032360159866900,Thu Sep 11 11:49:25 +0000 2014,@LannyDavis 3-to repeat what I have always written - presumption of guilt wrong. Presume innocence in our constitution - wait for facts.
510032020253458400,Thu Sep 11 11:48:04 +0000 2014,@LannyDavis  2-thus embarrassing to all those jumping to conclusions about Goodell rather than waiting - and caring - about facts first.
510031642300514300,Thu Sep 11 11:46:34 +0000 2014,1-AP reporter says we don't know who woman at NFL office was, what tape she was responding to, and whether anyone at NFL actually saw tape.
510027638942216200,Thu Sep 11 11:30:39 +0000 2014,@timmarchman appoint Robert Mueller to do independent investigation.
510026774525513700,Thu Sep 11 11:27:13 +0000 2014,@eclipsedave Dave I still respect and admire Keith. He is brilliant and has progressivism--but sometimes anger  causes  problems for him.
509912666140581900,Thu Sep 11 03:53:47 +0000 2014,@dankmtl you have no facts yet do you!? Just supposition. Do you know the difference?
509912301655560200,Thu Sep 11 03:52:21 +0000 2014,@bkyer1014 wrong. There is no AP report of independent verifocation of NFL official who "received" tape. Why not?
509911421644468200,Thu Sep 11 03:48:51 +0000 2014,@AAbbottBC yes of course. But hope you agree that facts first, jumping to conclusions based on anonymous sources not good for constitution
509910925055639550,Thu Sep 11 03:46:52 +0000 2014,@makarov__ not defending NFL - defending the presumption of innocence - wait for facts,which don't concern you. Assertions about me false
509908478081896450,Thu Sep 11 03:37:09 +0000 2014,@bonedog84 all sources are anonymous - hiding - and AP does not report it has independently verified truth. Vmail tape unclear which tape!
509907473298636800,Thu Sep 11 03:33:09 +0000 2014,@DanaPerino @jamiedupree good choice by Commr Goodell - who I believe did not know about 2d tape. Any evidence to contrary!? No. No facts.
509907088735502340,Thu Sep 11 03:31:38 +0000 2014,2) once again: We see those who race to mike's to declare Goodell must go vs those who wait for facts-Mueller good choice to get facts
509905799662288900,Thu Sep 11 03:26:30 +0000 2014,1) Watch how quickly NFL critics jump to conclusions beyond facts based on all anonymously-sourced AP story with no facts - just "sources."
509905010273320960,Thu Sep 11 03:23:22 +0000 2014,@SportsCenter @HotlineJosh  excellent choice and decision by Commr Goodell - Mueller has outstanding integrity, law enforcement experience
509895750298255360,Thu Sep 11 02:46:34 +0000 2014,@meetthepress @morningmika @chucktodd  anyone see the problem with using labels like "hawkish" rather than facts when doing punditry?
509895543129399300,Thu Sep 11 02:45:45 +0000 2014,@meetthepress @chucktodd  Given Wash Post poll data, Demo base supports his policies - supporting Syrian opposition and destroying ISIS.
509895204263178240,Thu Sep 11 02:44:24 +0000 2014,@meetthepress @morningmika @chucktodd Will Chuck describe Pres Obama has too "hawkish" and "out of touch" with base - an "interventionist"?
509893522556993540,Thu Sep 11 02:37:43 +0000 2014,@marcthiessen @MichaelLaRosaDC fair point, Marc. But he got it right finally. Now will the pundits accuse him of being to "hawkish"?
509877121603620860,Thu Sep 11 01:32:33 +0000 2014,@morningmika @zbig Dad Zbig is always thoughtful - look forward to his insights. Hope you are well Mika. Lanny
509876827159281660,Thu Sep 11 01:31:23 +0000 2014,5) I only wish Pres Obama had  used the words "destroy ISIS" as our mission before tonight. Hope he keeps talking to us as he did tonite.
509875080005189600,Thu Sep 11 01:24:26 +0000 2014,4) But: why no mention of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, UAE, Qutar and Turkey? Why no mention of England, France, and Germany? Why just the US?
509874749762453500,Thu Sep 11 01:23:08 +0000 2014,3) I question whether pundits are out of touch when they jump to use labels like "hawkish" without reference to facts. Proud of Pres Obama.
509874467037012000,Thu Sep 11 01:22:00 +0000 2014,2) But will pundits say this makes President Obama a "hawk" "out of touch" with Democratic Party base? Look at polls. He is not out of touch
509873915200815100,Thu Sep 11 01:19:49 +0000 2014,1) one of Barack Obama's great speeches. Support of moderate opposition and air power to degrade and destroy ISIS because ISIS threatens US
