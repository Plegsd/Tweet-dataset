12864186900,Mon Apr 26 04:30:18 +0000 2010,Game set match! Utah takes the 3-1 lead over Denver. See yall in the mile high city for game 5!
12864096510,Mon Apr 26 04:28:10 +0000 2010,Melo is heating up with back to back 3's and 39pts... Might be a little to late. Less than a minute left...
12863886799,Mon Apr 26 04:23:06 +0000 2010,Carlos Boozer 13-19 from the field is impressive. He is hitting some real tough shots and putting the Jazz on his shoulders.
12863425012,Mon Apr 26 04:12:24 +0000 2010,Milsap fouling out is huge for the Nuggets bigs. He is a force down low and that might open things up...

12863070713,Mon Apr 26 04:04:24 +0000 2010,Like I said 20pt game to an 11pt game. Pts get scored fast. Denver is still in this game. Esp when they put Carmelo back in.
12862390533,Mon Apr 26 03:49:49 +0000 2010,Great thing about the NBA is just when you think a team has lost they get right back in it. Especially a scoring team like Denver!
12862062757,Mon Apr 26 03:42:54 +0000 2010,Salt Lake City is one of my favorite places to play out of all the places we travel too. Seems like you are surrounded by mountains!
12861813735,Mon Apr 26 03:37:41 +0000 2010,Utah is really taking it to Denver right now. When that crowd gets going, that can be a really tough place to play!

12495645451,Tue Apr 20 03:52:03 +0000 2010,Utah needs to close this half out right. That would be huge to go into halftime with a 12pt lead.
12495363184,Tue Apr 20 03:45:52 +0000 2010,And here goes Boozer, if he can stretch the defense and keep shooting like this is will help cover for Okur being out.
