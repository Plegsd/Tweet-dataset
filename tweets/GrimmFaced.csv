587505498762514400,Mon Apr 13 06:40:00 +0000 2015,@jrnybot only one counter point. All data is equal- yet we pay either telco or ISP to access. Only way out- the net should be free access :)
587504917213945900,Mon Apr 13 06:37:42 +0000 2015,@jrnybot fully agree. If Zero in anyway is anti-consumer, anti-open internet it needs to be struck down. Just trying to understand is all :)

587503717680746500,Mon Apr 13 06:32:56 +0000 2015,@jrnybot the onus then is on the not free seller to be that good that I deem it worthy to pay to access?
587503141328818200,Mon Apr 13 06:30:38 +0000 2015,@jrnybot re: your snapshot. Surely then it's the consumers choice. Opt for a bucket of free services or pay to access others.
587502688130084900,Mon Apr 13 06:28:50 +0000 2015,@jrnybot assuming speeds are constant and equal, the seller paying for access helps more people access the net and should be a good thing?
587499443827511300,Mon Apr 13 06:15:57 +0000 2015,@jrnybot sure it does but how does that violate net neutrality?
587495876999778300,Mon Apr 13 06:01:46 +0000 2015,@jrnybot right now consumer pays, with Zero Flipkart will pay. If telco decides to give faster access to Flip and charges Y+ thats wrong.
587495600561586200,Mon Apr 13 06:00:40 +0000 2015,@jrnybot the entire debate is that telco cannot decide if a service can be charged extra for. Using a service uses X data that costs Y (1/2)
587495238580580400,Mon Apr 13 05:59:14 +0000 2015,@jrnybot but Airtel maintains that the platform is open to all as long as they pay :)
587493509134856200,Mon Apr 13 05:52:22 +0000 2015,@jrnybot if all remained equal and Flipkart paid airtel for preferential access, then it would be anti-consumer and violates net neutrality.
