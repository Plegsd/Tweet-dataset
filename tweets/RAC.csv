824741210904408000,Thu Jan 26 22:10:02 +0000 2017,@EffEcks I definitely considered it, but I'm going for a half windows/hackintosh and the 1080 apparently is incompatible

824712693714219000,Thu Jan 26 20:16:43 +0000 2017,@berryboy Oh for sure! I'll likely switch it out for a 1080 at some point. I think this cost about 550
824710884849094700,Thu Jan 26 20:09:31 +0000 2017,@berryboy @rbvea This 980 has a watercooler attached, so apparently it can get pretty fast. Either way, this isn't exactly a gaming build
824710520833921000,Thu Jan 26 20:08:05 +0000 2017,@YourEDMBen I know, I considered it. We'll see

824709487269449700,Thu Jan 26 20:03:58 +0000 2017,@perrohunter around 1800 total, so not cheap, but it could have been much worse

824709084871958500,Thu Jan 26 20:02:22 +0000 2017,@YourEDMBen Yeah, I'm hoping that it came flashed with the latest version, otherwise I have to borrow an older chip :/
824708964868722700,Thu Jan 26 20:01:54 +0000 2017,@perrohunter it's incompatible with hackintosh and it's not exactly a pure gaming build so that was my reasoning
824707560901013500,Thu Jan 26 19:56:19 +0000 2017,@rbvea @berryboy I got the 980 for the hackintosh potential. Apparently the 1080 isn't compatible yet. Apparently you can OC this to match
