26711587317,Fri Oct 08 02:51:03 +0000 2010,Is corruption and (what a friend calls) "crony capitalism" India's single biggest problem? Is the PM or any political leader tackling it?

26673755204,Thu Oct 07 18:15:04 +0000 2010,CWG: its not just the costs, major problem is the low revenues from a low grade global event. Low TV income, low spectator interest.
26672943958,Thu Oct 07 18:03:05 +0000 2010,Olympics vs CWG 1)Higher revenues 2)Top grade vs low grade CWG 3)TV and other revenues enough to pay for costs 4)Huge spectator interest
26672533093,Thu Oct 07 17:57:03 +0000 2010,If India makes a bid for the Olympics - should it be largely done by the private sector. To ensure efficiency and get rid of govt corruption
26672399796,Thu Oct 07 17:55:05 +0000 2010,So ... Should India ever host the Olympics? The Olympics are profitable - revenues are 100 times higher than the CWG. And can make a profit

26429521012,Tue Oct 05 04:53:03 +0000 2010,EVMs prevent booth capturing (nobody can enter a booth and stamp hundreds of ballot papers) as they accept only one vote every 90 seconds.
26429414710,Tue Oct 05 04:51:03 +0000 2010,The election commission has given numerous chances to doubters to demonstrate - yet there's absolutely NO evidence that EVMs can be fiddled

19937246358,Fri Jul 30 20:29:02 +0000 2010,Nothing reduces poverty more than creating irrigation.  IRRIGATION reduces dependence on the monsoon, allows double and triple crops.
19919729997,Fri Jul 30 15:55:05 +0000 2010,Best news of the year? My view: The monsoon is now nearly normal. From -16% deficit, now only -5%. 700 mn people will benefit. Your views?
19917499529,Fri Jul 30 15:25:06 +0000 2010,India's new ways to protest - stop work in parliament, waste lakhs of litres of milk, throw mikes,  Shld we allow our children to watch?
19916437571,Fri Jul 30 15:11:03 +0000 2010,It was also great talking to the original little master - the excellent cricket mind Sunil Gavaskar. Do watch him too on ndtv.com. On Sachin
19895971774,Fri Jul 30 08:51:04 +0000 2010,It was most inspiring talking to Julian Assange the founder of Wikileaks - do try and watch him on NDTV.com if you missed it last night.
19765852123,Wed Jul 28 19:50:17 +0000 2010,@AnujaPrashar thank you very much. Very kind of you.
19734716906,Wed Jul 28 11:55:04 +0000 2010,I am interviewing the British PM, David Cameron, at 7:15pm this evening ... what questions would you like me to ask him?

19414787218,Sat Jul 24 11:31:03 +0000 2010,Btw. Shouldn't FIFA use TV replay technology? Some say it'll slow the game down but the current arguing with the ref slows it down more.
19414031463,Sat Jul 24 11:13:03 +0000 2010,@Kawaljit. You're right, the Vuvuzelas were much better INSIDE the stadium than the bzzzz on TV.  In stadium they added to the atmosphere
19413620799,Sat Jul 24 11:03:03 +0000 2010,Frankly, I wish Ghana won - a better team and great for Africa.  Suarez? Is there any nation that would not do what Suarez did? Be honest.
19413536052,Sat Jul 24 11:01:03 +0000 2010,OK I'll start: Super Ghana missing the last min. penalty and losing the shoot out. 'Condemned' but was Uruguay's Suarez a crook or a hero?
19412890864,Sat Jul 24 10:45:05 +0000 2010,I keep re-visiting the Football World Cup - esp the success for South Africa. Great football too. What are the 5 most memorable moments?
19332853619,Fri Jul 23 11:51:04 +0000 2010,RT@vkhanna. Yes, since the NDTV campaign the proposed 180 ports are stopped & Pondicherry is getting funds to get it's beach back. A start.
19331334162,Fri Jul 23 11:21:03 +0000 2010,The good news: this is REVERSIBLE..  We can get our beaches back.  If we are determined.  Watch Pondicherry change their rock back to sand.
19331140191,Fri Jul 23 11:17:03 +0000 2010,The result of 180 !!!! ports: 50% of our beaches are now rocks and 50% of our coastal villages are suffering from salty subsoil water.
19331044959,Fri Jul 23 11:15:05 +0000 2010,5) sand is a filter. When the sandy coastline turns to rock, salty water seeps inland & the village wells become saline & crops can't grow.
19330948911,Fri Jul 23 11:13:03 +0000 2010,2) whenever a PORT is built the flow of sand is interrupted and sand piles up on the south side of the port & the north side turns to rock.
19330854592,Fri Jul 23 11:11:03 +0000 2010,4) Instead of having about 20 Ports, India, because of corruption, has a ridiculous  no. - 180 ports - another 180 ports were planned !!
19330760269,Fri Jul 23 11:09:04 +0000 2010,3) port owners should dredge the sand from the south and place it in the north - nobody does this :(. It's a disgrace.
19330185988,Fri Jul 23 10:57:03 +0000 2010,Rt@Samarthsr. The reason why 50% of our coastline has turned to rock? 1) our beaches are like rivers of sand. Sand flows from south to north
19329377473,Fri Jul 23 10:39:04 +0000 2010,Rt@vikramchandra. Disgrace that the Goa govt can't remove that ghastly, rusting shipwreck for 8 years. Time for the people of Goa to act?
19329114866,Fri Jul 23 10:33:04 +0000 2010,Rt@vikramchandra I agree - it's so terribly sad to see the Goa beaches turning to rock. Now 50% of India's sandy coastline is rock.  50%!
17983001720,Wed Jul 07 21:33:03 +0000 2010,Yay! At last a team to support in the finals. Wine (not beer) drinking, emotional, flair, and brillaint. Spain totally dominated the match.

17148243040,Sun Jun 27 07:06:26 +0000 2010,@vkhanna6 yes, mine too I guess. Watch out for the Brazil-Chile match. Chile is a really great team - underestimated. One bad day v Spain.
17143056169,Sun Jun 27 05:15:03 +0000 2010,Isn't it lovely to see the magic of South American soccer do so well, leaving behind the dour machine-like professionalism of Europe. So far

16598624283,Sun Jun 20 06:15:03 +0000 2010,A friend points out on Kanishka. Zero compensation. The guilty walk free. A new report blames the Canadian govt. Will anything happen now?
16594649915,Sun Jun 20 04:53:02 +0000 2010,There are 3 things to focus on for Bhopal - compensation, compensation, compensation. Reopen the case.  BP compensation now may hit $100bn.
16594547791,Sun Jun 20 04:51:03 +0000 2010,This demand for Anderson's extradition let's the govt off the hook. He'll never be extradited. The govt will happily go thru the motions.

16379113922,Thu Jun 17 10:49:03 +0000 2010,Shocking that 3 ministers+Ronen Sen+Supreme Court+Ratan Tata (all of whom I respect help Dow/UCC get away with a ridiculously low payment.
16378203975,Thu Jun 17 10:27:02 +0000 2010,The Rajya Sabha votes are less about politics, more about Money Honey. The standard rate is Rs 1 cr per vote. Time to stop this disgrace?

15523695175,Sun Jun 06 01:27:02 +0000 2010,As I was saying :-) watch out for NDTV's extra-special coverage of the football world cup. Btw which team are you backing?
13996370917,Fri May 14 20:41:04 +0000 2010,Can you think of a better innings than Hussey's? Or a better semi-final world cup match than this Aus-Pak one?  Btw, who were you backing?
13996281538,Fri May 14 20:39:04 +0000 2010,Hussey's innings must be perhaps the finest 20-20 innings ever. To perform like that under intense pressure in a key match is remarkable.

13515309121,Thu May 06 23:43:15 +0000 2010,Btw India's elex much more environment-friendly than UK/USA. Switching from ballot papers to EVMs saves hundreds of thousands of trees.
13515122980,Thu May 06 23:39:15 +0000 2010,One reason why India's electronic voting machines are virtually impossible to hack is that our EVMs are not connected online. Smart move.
13514843423,Thu May 06 23:33:22 +0000 2010,@samarthsrathaur Your're right. India using EVMs makes us proud. Way ahead of UK and USA. Great achievement esp with so many more voters.
13514638830,Thu May 06 23:29:15 +0000 2010,UK Election Scandal: after UK messes up it's own voting, isn't it unfair of the BBC anchor to call it a "Third World" type election?
13514341461,Thu May 06 23:23:09 +0000 2010,UK Election Scandal: UK still uses ballot papers. India has electronic voting machines - making our counting quicker and more accurate.
13514140876,Thu May 06 23:19:09 +0000 2010,UK Election scandal: BBC anchor callling the mess a Third World type election is unfair. India's elections are far ahead of UK elections.
13513954548,Thu May 06 23:15:18 +0000 2010,UK Election Scandal: BBC anchor calls these British elections a "Third World" type election because it's so badly organized.
13513851350,Thu May 06 23:13:05 +0000 2010,UK Election Scandal: in some polling stations didn't have enough ballot papers, as a result many voters could not vote.
13513759351,Thu May 06 23:11:07 +0000 2010,UK Election Scandal: many voters queued but could not vote as polling stations shut their doors at 10pm. It's being called a "scandal"

12825341023,Sun Apr 25 14:53:04 +0000 2010,So who's going to win? Mumbai has a better record but Chennai has momentum. What are the winnning % chances? Mumbai 60% and Chennai 40%? Or?

12409774532,Sun Apr 18 18:01:03 +0000 2010,Now - the IPL finals has no north indian teams. All south and Mumbai. (unless KKR produces a miracle). Expected? Is South better than North?
