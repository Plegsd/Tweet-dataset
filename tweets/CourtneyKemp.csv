780221228338520000,Mon Sep 26 01:43:31 +0000 2016,Tariq kept his mouth SHUT. Don't sleep on Tariq. Remember he's half Ghost and half Tasha. @michaelraineyjr is a marvel. #PowerFinale

780220580784181200,Mon Sep 26 01:40:56 +0000 2016,If you've ever had a man tell you that "you still love me and I still love you," it's powerful as hell-- if it's true. #PowerFinale

780219105945280500,Mon Sep 26 01:35:05 +0000 2016,Tommy is making moves. His relationship with Petar is getting more complicated. @JosephSikora4 has done great work in S3. #PowerFinale
780218487797125100,Mon Sep 26 01:32:37 +0000 2016,People keep saying Tariq is dumb. Tariq doesn't know Kanan!!! Why would you expect him to know that?
780217405763121200,Mon Sep 26 01:28:19 +0000 2016,Watching #PowerTV with a live audience is such a privilege. People react OUT LOUD. It's amazing. #PowerFinale

780216499269144600,Mon Sep 26 01:24:43 +0000 2016,That line about Ghost driving an Uber? That's an improv from the always excellent @JosephSikora4! #PowerFinale
780216270289535000,Mon Sep 26 01:23:49 +0000 2016,We wanted this moment to be about Greg abusing his power-- pulling Ghost over cause he can. #PowerFinale
780215546591768600,Mon Sep 26 01:20:56 +0000 2016,One of my favorite scenes of television I've ever been involved in. @OmariHardwick and @andybeanactor at their finest. #PowerFinale

777733291038433300,Mon Sep 19 04:57:20 +0000 2016,See Tommy's growth here. He asks Ghost to explain his plan, even after condemning the lies. Ghost is right about Milan. #PowerTV

777725038829142000,Mon Sep 19 04:24:33 +0000 2016,Ghost has to be very careful of how he plays Tommy. He's still making moves, but he can't bring Tommy inside. #PowerTV
777724894155014100,Mon Sep 19 04:23:58 +0000 2016,Tommy killed Holly because of Ghost. He can't really forgive or move on from that. It's a lot of grief. And anger. #PowerTV
777724232528719900,Mon Sep 19 04:21:21 +0000 2016,Milan isn't wrong about Tommy's attachment to Ghost. Tommy wants to stay in the game. Ghost doesn't.  At odds philosophically. #PowerTV

777721579308458000,Mon Sep 19 04:10:48 +0000 2016,Dre is realizing that he has lost control of the situation with Tariq and Kanan. The kid loves Kanan. #PowerTV

770078482890158100,Mon Aug 29 01:59:52 +0000 2016,I am so fortunate to have such amazing actors on the show. That we can just end an episode on @OmariHardwick's face and it tells us ALL...
770078271690145800,Mon Aug 29 01:59:01 +0000 2016,I am in consistent awe of @LelaLoren's performance as Angela. It's so many layers, such hard work EVERY EPISODE. #powerTV
770077752187883500,Mon Aug 29 01:56:58 +0000 2016,I love the choreography @OmariHardwick @LelaLoren &amp; @TheRealRobHardy found for this moment. It's not sexy, it's desperate. #powerTV

770076645692702700,Mon Aug 29 01:52:34 +0000 2016,Ghost should have brought Tasha into the circle of trust. If she'd known about Milan "Dean" woulda never made it upstairs. #powerTV

770070062652948500,Mon Aug 29 01:26:24 +0000 2016,Ghost sees that Milan knows everything. The club dream and Angela made Ghost take his eyes off the ball, and this is the price. #powerTV
