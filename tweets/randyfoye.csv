13161347574,Sat May 01 01:16:19 +0000 2010,@OfficialEdgar yeah theres still time
13160383378,Sat May 01 00:55:46 +0000 2010,Hawks went on a 19-0 run and the Bucks go 8 minutes without a field goal so now it's 56-38 Atl they came out hungry after halftime
13159934345,Sat May 01 00:45:58 +0000 2010,Bucks have to be feeling urgency too knowing if they cant get it done tonight they have to win in Atl where they were 0-2 to start
13159873361,Sat May 01 00:44:39 +0000 2010,Bucks cant let this lead grow any more. Hawks seem to finally sense it could be over for them tonight. But man still a overall sloppy game

13158341480,Sat May 01 00:10:50 +0000 2010,Atlanta needs to get it together quit making sloppy plays. Man this is a low scoring game 34-31 Bucks at the half @HAWKSvBUCKS #NBAP10

13157521376,Fri Apr 30 23:52:35 +0000 2010,Another 3 by Delfino so its a tie game and Hawks are calling timeout to calm things down.
13157447149,Fri Apr 30 23:50:54 +0000 2010,Nice 3 by Delfino and big stop at the other end by Bucks. They need another basket here

12548032796,Wed Apr 21 01:05:38 +0000 2010,The Bucks need to stop Johnson he's got the hot hand. Is this the biggest lead tonight?
12547874236,Wed Apr 21 01:02:36 +0000 2010,And Joe Johnson getting it done for the Hawks. It's playoff time and players do what it takes to win.
12547779433,Wed Apr 21 01:00:49 +0000 2010,John Salmons stepping up big for the Bucks tonight. Let's see if they can get this one and even the series.
12545803062,Wed Apr 21 00:10:07 +0000 2010,Hawks up 52-46 on Bucks at half. Not getting much of anything from their bench though. Great game so far whos joining me for 2nd half?
12545724967,Wed Apr 21 00:08:23 +0000 2010,@BenAgent0 whats up
12545497108,Wed Apr 21 00:03:36 +0000 2010,Lets see if the Bucks can go on a run before the half
12545236125,Tue Apr 20 23:58:23 +0000 2010,Gonna have a contest tomorrow on here, see who's been following my career since college. But you must be following me on here to win.

12543404438,Tue Apr 20 23:19:45 +0000 2010,Mbah a Moute came to play he has almost all the Bucks points right now. More balanced for Hawks.

12542819936,Tue Apr 20 23:07:22 +0000 2010,The Hawks are 34-7 at home. How big of a factor is that for tonights game? @HAWKSvBUCKS

12541682131,Tue Apr 20 22:42:43 +0000 2010,Hawks leads series after winning first game. They came out hard early. But Bucks made a strong comeback. Who do you have winning tonight?
