791778742813257700,Thu Oct 27 23:08:57 +0000 2016,To dismiss vine as a haven for the attention seeking millenial is like looking at any mainstream artist and dismissing the entire art form.

564863909870710800,Mon Feb 09 19:10:25 +0000 2015,Whereas the #AIBRoast debate addresses that it hurt a few. It never asked them WHY it hurt them.Because THEN you'd hear an irrational reason
