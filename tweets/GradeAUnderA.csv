694883465196544000,Wed Feb 03 14:01:43 +0000 2016,@izze03 It's damage control. It's his 3rd video he's made while knowing *zero* about my issues with him. Desperately rallying his troops :p
694882769462300700,Wed Feb 03 13:58:57 +0000 2016,@_Luminism So he can DM me. Tyrone was complaining we hadn't talked, so I opened up a route of contact for him.

694707437828464600,Wed Feb 03 02:22:14 +0000 2016,@SuperMinerX That's one of my main points against reactions. They rape the substantial clause by using the *ENTIRE* video lol.

694706380465377300,Wed Feb 03 02:18:02 +0000 2016,@SuperMinerX Noone would use my videos as a substitute for listening to the actual songs, you see what I'm saying?
694706270809514000,Wed Feb 03 02:17:36 +0000 2016,@SuperMinerX Fair use policy has a substantial-ity criteria. Given that I use 2 seconds snippets of 4+ minute long songs, no.

575073650241634300,Mon Mar 09 23:20:17 +0000 2015,I'll try and reply to everyone on Twitter this weekend if I can. And if anyone's wondering what I'm not happy about, finish this sentence:
574701669931434000,Sun Mar 08 22:42:10 +0000 2015,Gonna be a busy week.
574701568752222200,Sun Mar 08 22:41:46 +0000 2015,So fingers crossed, a video on Saturday as I had originally planned, but another will now be coming by, I dunno, Friday. Pissed.
574701278162468860,Sun Mar 08 22:40:36 +0000 2015,I'm still going to be making a video for Saturday, but this is another I have to make, before then.
574701170314342400,Sun Mar 08 22:40:11 +0000 2015,&gt;:0!! Something happened which I found out about and I'm *not* fucking happy. Will be making a video about it.
574322102863589400,Sat Mar 07 21:33:54 +0000 2015,Pixar do my animations but they're being douches. So the long waits between my uploads are their fault, not mine.
574321805185450000,Sat Mar 07 21:32:43 +0000 2015,My video making process is: 1) idea 2) storyboard 3) Record audio 4) Edit audio(takes FOREVER!) 5) Make slides 6) Match audio and slides
574321446123601900,Sat Mar 07 21:31:17 +0000 2015,Will hopefully have 3 storyboards done by tomorrow and I REALLY wanna get a video done by next saturday or something.

571678137836290050,Sat Feb 28 14:27:43 +0000 2015,My tweet count just went up from 26 to 119. OK maybe I can see how some people's counts are so high. But still, 54k is ridiculous.

548678393127256060,Sat Dec 27 03:14:57 +0000 2014,In summary, I'll *always* be looking to make vids, just for myself. I may be inactive, but I can't see myself ever stopping. Fyi. Peace
548677984929218560,Sat Dec 27 03:13:20 +0000 2014,So in that 6 weeks of chilling, I don't have any excuses, I should be able to make stuff. Just giving an update.
548677736685109250,Sat Dec 27 03:12:21 +0000 2014,That being said, I'm looking to have a new video up by the end of next week. Then I have 2 weeks of hectic-ness, then 6 weeks of chilling
548677557668053000,Sat Dec 27 03:11:38 +0000 2014,But finding time to make one is hard. Damn you, job &gt;:(
548677447114555400,Sat Dec 27 03:11:11 +0000 2014,Making vids is so damn fun. But being an adult sucks. I'll be trying to make videos as long as I have at least 25 or so people watching them
543900991826186240,Sat Dec 13 22:51:16 +0000 2014,But don't get your hopes up. I have a history of disappointing people. Just ask my parents.
543900836880187400,Sat Dec 13 22:50:39 +0000 2014,I'm still alive. Video coming soon-ish. PGCE is time consuming. I have Sunday planned for video editing, so could be video tomorrow!
530152604391575550,Thu Nov 06 00:20:05 +0000 2014,I'm serious, btw
530152552965222400,Thu Nov 06 00:19:53 +0000 2014,I'll upload a video and within 3 mins, it has like 10 views. I still find that *crazy*!
530149456146997250,Thu Nov 06 00:07:34 +0000 2014,o/ Hi. Uploaded Public Bathrooms Part 2. http://t.co/TieGwvhpgr. Look I tweeted!
528200557916606460,Fri Oct 31 15:03:21 +0000 2014,Also, my voice is sore from shouting. That can only mean one thing....... another shitty video soon. If anyone cares, Sunday-ish, hopefully
528200244379799550,Fri Oct 31 15:02:06 +0000 2014,I'm looking at my last tweet from 19months ago and wondering what the #LiesIveToldMyParents thing was about. What the hell?
