964039738511560700,Thu Feb 15 07:32:39 +0000 2018,@jdmuccigrosso True—but then why didn’t the CENTER listeners prefer B, the HomePod, which was right in front of them?

908178446039371800,Thu Sep 14 03:59:49 +0000 2017,@rjonesy Right! Did you see my update? https://t.co/lQWUmk5UnT
908168271580598300,Thu Sep 14 03:19:23 +0000 2017,@diana567 Yes, EXACTLY my thoughts. So hard to read… but soooo good.
908167129194811400,Thu Sep 14 03:14:51 +0000 2017,Wow. Cincinnati Enquirer sent 60 reporters to profile the heroin epidemic—one city, one week. This will win awards. https://t.co/0HyL9lnsgr
908160764703383600,Thu Sep 14 02:49:33 +0000 2017,@KarlEgas No, it won’t work with eyes closed. The blind person would have to open his/her eyes—or just use the passcode.
908154941012893700,Thu Sep 14 02:26:25 +0000 2017,@heazey_marpy No, your eyes have to be open and looking at the phone.
908153596897906700,Thu Sep 14 02:21:04 +0000 2017,@DVEllice There’s a big difference, though. Windows Hello, and iPhone X, use DEPTH cameras—so you can’t fool ‘em with a photo.
908153424654602200,Thu Sep 14 02:20:23 +0000 2017,@melis_tx No, because your eyes have to be open for Face ID to work!
908153360028770300,Thu Sep 14 02:20:08 +0000 2017,Heard from Apple on what happened when Face ID “failed” onstage. My 1st theory was wrong; my 2nd wasn’t. Details: https://t.co/lQWUmk5UnT
908127438802169900,Thu Sep 14 00:37:08 +0000 2017,@pradym That’s right. So you would type in your password in that case. (Same thing if your fingerprint got damaged.)
908125101392105500,Thu Sep 14 00:27:50 +0000 2017,@JackAubrey3 @Digmyearth I'm afraid I don't know! But you’d have the same problem with fingerprints, no?
908123237611196400,Thu Sep 14 00:20:26 +0000 2017,@johnrooksjr That’s exactly right. The same car accident would cut your finger. But we don’t worry about THAT, do we?
908123064327708700,Thu Sep 14 00:19:45 +0000 2017,@Digmyearth No. You have to be looking at the phone for Face ID to work.
908120195130118100,Thu Sep 14 00:08:21 +0000 2017,@petefrompa You don’t have to use Face ID. You can stick with the password.
908120124099526700,Thu Sep 14 00:08:04 +0000 2017,@Boston_Training Then you’d use your password.
908120083276423200,Thu Sep 14 00:07:54 +0000 2017,@merovee458 You can indeed use a password instead. Face ID is optional.
908120033150283800,Thu Sep 14 00:07:42 +0000 2017,@GhostDog36C Then tell her your password. Or teach it to learn HER face.
908113762892296200,Wed Sep 13 23:42:47 +0000 2017,You may not like the idea of face recognition to unlock phones, but “What if I’m in a car accident”? Come on. (Hint: Type your password.)

908037883772133400,Wed Sep 13 18:41:16 +0000 2017,@gavproductions Good question! The iPhone X can display HDR video, but no other phones.

829184744864755700,Wed Feb 08 04:27:03 +0000 2017,@bd_levine Well, sort of. Murkowski voted FOR DeVos in committee, when it counted most. https://t.co/PgMDtEuDd8
829151935630565400,Wed Feb 08 02:16:41 +0000 2017,@BrianJMull Absolutely right. Hard to explain to people! https://t.co/PgMDtEuDd8
829151801177960400,Wed Feb 08 02:16:08 +0000 2017,@megbest Well, yes and no. She originally cast the deciding committee vote FOR DeVos: https://t.co/PgMDtEuDd8

829085218787192800,Tue Feb 07 21:51:34 +0000 2017,@mickeysolar If there’s an example of a Democratic cabinet pick with no experience…who paid off Senators… let me know! I’ll squawk!
829084921536847900,Tue Feb 07 21:50:23 +0000 2017,@mlp60 Yes, I tweeted that immediately afterward! :)
829067370664751100,Tue Feb 07 20:40:39 +0000 2017,@domo1944 There’s a big difference: Clinton had experience and qualifications. DeVos has none.
829067235654303700,Tue Feb 07 20:40:06 +0000 2017,@OmniscientCav Yes, I followed up with a second tweet about that. (However, she did vote FOR DeVos “in committee,” before the final vote!)
829057900517654500,Tue Feb 07 20:03:01 +0000 2017,@TOGSolid Right! I followed up with a tweet on that point...
829053507277901800,Tue Feb 07 19:45:33 +0000 2017,@MrDGoldman @lisamurkowski Yes, true. That’s why I followed up with a clarifying tweet. :)
829039892315398100,Tue Feb 07 18:51:27 +0000 2017,@marcrapp The point is qualifications. Every politician gets donations, including Clinton. But she at least had experience for the job.
