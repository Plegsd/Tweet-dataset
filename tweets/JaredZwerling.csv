620408982427975700,Mon Jul 13 01:46:42 +0000 2015,A key difference I've seen b/w Mudiay &amp; Russell is DR looks for outside shot earlier in dribble. Better shot. EM very pass first/attacking.
620402638257938400,Mon Jul 13 01:21:30 +0000 2015,@Brilltime Zinger is a unique breed of a player so very intriguing. Mudiay is not a Triangle player; didn't want to play it.
620402242479239200,Mon Jul 13 01:19:55 +0000 2015,@CPGaren Mudiay's shot will be the key. Russell better there; has in and out game. Mudiay better floor game.

620057996945559600,Sun Jul 12 02:32:01 +0000 2015,Future of Lakers' backcourt is very good. Russell smooth/savvy, and Clarkson evolving with iso moves. Kobe will get easier shots, less work.

614232462261141500,Fri Jun 26 00:43:25 +0000 2015,With Justise Winslow the Heat gets their 1st Roc Nation guy. Guess who else is signed to Roc? Kevin Durant. Building relationship helps '16.

607728194909794300,Mon Jun 08 01:57:47 +0000 2015,Even though that dunk was waved off, incredible to see Shaun Livingston get up like that after months and years of recovery.
607723284692648000,Mon Jun 08 01:38:16 +0000 2015,I'd say this game is coming down to LeBron vs. Iguodala in isolation with six seconds left, Part 2.
607713426564124700,Mon Jun 08 00:59:06 +0000 2015,If the Cavaliers' game plan coming in was to allow Klay Thompson to go off and limit everyone else, then I'd say they're accomplishing that.
607709080204017700,Mon Jun 08 00:41:50 +0000 2015,That's back-to-back subpar 1st quarters by the Warriors, as Cavaliers are making stops &amp; facilitating the pace they want in the game so far.
607707605239251000,Mon Jun 08 00:35:58 +0000 2015,By my count, 5 total drives -- and good ones -- by JR Smith and Iman Shumpert. Key. Have basically already surpassed that based on Game 1.
607706018190139400,Mon Jun 08 00:29:40 +0000 2015,Warriors are doing a good job of sending a surprise second defender in the post (esp. vs. LeBron) &amp; controlling the defensive glass better.
607577488445870100,Sun Jun 07 15:58:56 +0000 2015,All eyes are on this man tonight: Matthew Dellavedova ... My recent dinner w/ Matt on his impact &amp; journey to Finals http://t.co/nI7VaBltDW
607252618583359500,Sat Jun 06 18:28:01 +0000 2015,Let's not forget when B. Griffin suffered also a broken left kneecap in '09 &amp; he's gotten better each year. Full summer ahead for Kyrie key.
607243553270558700,Sat Jun 06 17:51:59 +0000 2015,@ArdenSportsTalk For example, whatever happened to Aquille Carr? I know under-sized, but my point is way too many of the same YouTube clips.

607219760246452200,Sat Jun 06 16:17:27 +0000 2015,In March/April '13, when he won Sixth Man, JR Smith was getting 8/9/10 FT attempts a game. He's got to be key 2nd attacker after LeBron now.

606934453903048700,Fri Jun 05 21:23:44 +0000 2015,Cavs announce that Kyrie Irving has a fractured left kneecap. Surgery to come. Expected to miss 3-4 months.
606912378983301100,Fri Jun 05 19:56:01 +0000 2015,David Blatt on Kyrie Irving during press conference: "We're very concerned physically what the result is going to be."
606670334851477500,Fri Jun 05 03:54:13 +0000 2015,It was LeBron, a little bit of Kyrie &amp; offensive rebounding. Who are going to be the Cavs' middle men in Game 2? Needed for better finishes.
606666097845235700,Fri Jun 05 03:37:23 +0000 2015,LeBron on the left side &lt; Curry on the left side.

606643609262280700,Fri Jun 05 02:08:01 +0000 2015,The Warriors are arguably the best team in the league at scoring threes off of offensive rebounds. Quick to corners. No hesitation.
606643080318599200,Fri Jun 05 02:05:55 +0000 2015,@RCorySmith I'd like to know.
606641519827808300,Fri Jun 05 01:59:43 +0000 2015,@RCorySmith What I just said. Watch clips from previous years.
606641149378461700,Fri Jun 05 01:58:15 +0000 2015,Noticed LeBron has changed FT routine slightly. Not sure when. Blows in hand and, to me, longer delay. Lower FT% in playoffs vs. past years.
606638173469438000,Fri Jun 05 01:46:26 +0000 2015,Suddenly Andre Iguodala is the Warriors' No. 1 option. Finding offense.
606635818728472600,Fri Jun 05 01:37:04 +0000 2015,Warriors are a team based on early offense &amp; runs. I don't see how they get a lead in 1st half without a big run. Half-court offense stall.
606633879278100500,Fri Jun 05 01:29:22 +0000 2015,Tristan and Timofey "TNT" very explosive and mobile down low and active in the paint. Came to play in very adverse environment. Huge so far.
606630971342004200,Fri Jun 05 01:17:48 +0000 2015,Irving playing too far off on Steph, not showing early contact. Got to show physicality early in games like this.

603797786132357100,Thu May 28 05:39:44 +0000 2015,Nice to hear about Sweetie, the Warriors' 105-year-old fan. My grandmother in Miami turns 107 soon &amp; has followed the Heat. Power of sports.
603777180728864800,Thu May 28 04:17:52 +0000 2015,Cavs need to keep TOs down and make open 3s consistently, and control pace. GS' D to O makes you pay and have more depth, which is X-factor.
603776274142658600,Thu May 28 04:14:16 +0000 2015,Irving may not be at 100% health, &amp; not a great PG defender, so Mozgov &amp; Tristan as hedgers, switchers &amp; rotating back very key vs. Curry.
603774144585474000,Thu May 28 04:05:48 +0000 2015,Find it fascinating that one star is a colossal figure in LeBron and the other is an everyday man in Curry. Two distinct styles and heroics.

603032991707856900,Tue May 26 03:00:43 +0000 2015,@StillFloatinNYK Wrong. Helmets are engineered and cushioned to lessen the effect of concussions, not intensify.
603031957438636000,Tue May 26 02:56:37 +0000 2015,@StillFloatinNYK Football players wear helmets; basketball players don't. Therefore NBA injuries may be more significant before examination.
603030755577569300,Tue May 26 02:51:50 +0000 2015,@StillFloatinNYK How did you know it wasn't a concussion before he was examined by doctors? I didn't either. My point is extreme precaution.
603030380375969800,Tue May 26 02:50:21 +0000 2015,A key issue I still have with Harden is he rarely runs back on D after a turnover. Many times he's off the screen lagging back.
603024336937590800,Tue May 26 02:26:20 +0000 2015,@StillFloatinNYK Not extreme. W/ a multimillion dollar investment like Curry, high precaution should be taken, as they do in NFL w/ helmets.

603022574793044000,Tue May 26 02:19:20 +0000 2015,@StillFloatinNYK Could be an internal head injury. Need full examine and X-Rays to be sure.
603020955397423100,Tue May 26 02:12:54 +0000 2015,Curry w/ head contusion. My take is wouldn't it be safer to be on a stretcher until X-rays instead of having him take a long walk off court?
603007821840457700,Tue May 26 01:20:42 +0000 2015,Curry 0-for-2. Harden 0-for-2. Rockets up 19-5. Who gets going first?

602837805492936700,Mon May 25 14:05:07 +0000 2015,Delly went from last year's Vegas Summer League to starting at point for the Cavs in ECF. That just doesn't happen. Scrappy but effective.
602837006876418000,Mon May 25 14:01:57 +0000 2015,More from Paul Goriss (ex-coach) on Delly: "Tough, physical, glue guy, do anything for the team. One of the hardest workers I have coached."
602836661630677000,Mon May 25 14:00:34 +0000 2015,Spoke w/ Dellavedova's ex-coach from Australia's AIS: "He's tough, relentless, assertive &amp; never backs down. That isn't dirty. Competitive."
602679578985795600,Mon May 25 03:36:23 +0000 2015,LeBron's game will get most attention, but Thompson gets a game ball, too. Offensive boards, finishes and switching well on Teague &amp; others.
602676832723337200,Mon May 25 03:25:28 +0000 2015,Who said LeBron is the only player who likes the left baseline corner? Somewhere, Curry is smiling ...

602675000366092300,Mon May 25 03:18:11 +0000 2015,Tristan Thompson finishes that layup lefty. Transitions to shooting free throws righty. In other words, doing a little bit of everything.
602664342190837800,Mon May 25 02:35:50 +0000 2015,Great adjustment for Cavs with no Horford, and LeBron resting: Attacking quickly in early offense, going right at Hawks' smaller lineup.
602662137652084700,Mon May 25 02:27:05 +0000 2015,@FredKatz Right. I mentioned "setups," which can lead to 3s.
602661554497040400,Mon May 25 02:24:46 +0000 2015,While the NBA game is more 3-pointers, most of the great perimeter players (MJ, Kobe, LeBron, etc.) still own the mid-post area in setups.
602298826578206700,Sun May 24 02:23:25 +0000 2015,1 of the best things we can ask for if there are 2 sweeps &amp; a week off is a healthy Steph Curry vs. Kyrie Irving. Dribbling wizardry &amp; more.
602296755233783800,Sun May 24 02:15:11 +0000 2015,If this game remains as is, let's just cut down the postgame analysis to 1 thing to give reporters an early night: Curry boxed out Howard.
602295086034997200,Sun May 24 02:08:33 +0000 2015,Only right that Steph Curry's record-breaking three-pointer doesn't happen anywhere near the arc. Special dude. http://t.co/tOdzmOoEZA

601966504318509000,Sat May 23 04:22:53 +0000 2015,.@EthanJSkolnick That's why I go with D'Angelo Russell as my top prospect. A passing point guard who can score and close games. NBA must.

594978847638036500,Sun May 03 21:36:26 +0000 2015,Making Klay Thompson even more impressive is how he went right at Tony Allen from the start. Off curls, drives. Set a big tone in the game.
594973295247794200,Sun May 03 21:14:22 +0000 2015,Among several things, Zach Randolph's perimeter defense has to be better next game. Warriors leaking Zach out a lot; he looks lost/too slow.

594948433842143200,Sun May 03 19:35:34 +0000 2015,Tony Allen vs. Klay Thompson or Stephen Curry at times ... Gonna be a good one!
594946692920795100,Sun May 03 19:28:39 +0000 2015,I remember when John Wall entered the NBA as a one-speed, baseline-to-baseline player. Has really evolved, and that midrange jumper is key.
594946225989951500,Sun May 03 19:26:48 +0000 2015,Sometimes too much of the Hawks' late-game offense is predicated on Kyle Korver. A key Hawks' Achilles heel is who takes the last shots.

583451862604488700,Thu Apr 02 02:12:18 +0000 2015,James Harden = 51 points. New career high.
583451641451425800,Thu Apr 02 02:11:25 +0000 2015,James Harden = 50 points. Going for 51 on this next free throw.
583450225739567100,Thu Apr 02 02:05:48 +0000 2015,James Harden with 49 points. More than 3 mins to go. 16-for-25 from the field, 8-for-9 from three, 9-for-9 from the line.
