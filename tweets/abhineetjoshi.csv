506649931096936450,Tue Sep 02 03:48:51 +0000 2014,@djbasrur He will only score five goals for you lot. And the option to purchase will not be exercised
506648926468861950,Tue Sep 02 03:44:51 +0000 2014,@djbasrur i think James Wilson will need a loan before he is ready for 1st team action. But Falcaooooo! :(
506648150027677700,Tue Sep 02 03:41:46 +0000 2014,@djbasrur Isn't RvP likely to undergo surgery? Keep him out for a few months. Or speculation?
506647910872670200,Tue Sep 02 03:40:49 +0000 2014,@djbasrur right right. The only upside I see is that he is 23 and there is a chance Wenger can get more out of him by playing CF.
506647282851135500,Tue Sep 02 03:38:19 +0000 2014,@djbasrur I was just about to Tweet you! Thoughts on Welbeck?
506642019410665500,Tue Sep 02 03:17:25 +0000 2014,At least Welbz is better than Sanogo. I hated him when he was at Utd on account of being such a crap player. Hope he gives us 20+ goals

392877538722062340,Wed Oct 23 04:57:59 +0000 2013,@SATYAJEIT  Ya man. Ramsey and Ozil looked knackered. We could take the game to them at the Westfalen with the return of Theo.

366882499051266050,Mon Aug 12 11:22:58 +0000 2013,@SATYAJEIT true. However, leveraging on Rosicky's fitness is risky business. Midfield desperately looking short.
366878342143688700,Mon Aug 12 11:06:27 +0000 2013,I have no idea how Wenger plans 2 replace Gervinho &amp; Arshavin. Theo is the only traditional winger we have. Santi on the wing and Ox in MF?

342661630645125100,Thu Jun 06 15:17:53 +0000 2013,@modernblues Maybe. Like Hulk's move to Zenith or wherever he went. Basically 3rd party gets yo exit investment. player free to choose club.
