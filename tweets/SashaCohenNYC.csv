436221271043747840,Wed Feb 19 19:30:30 +0000 2014,What a disappointing skate and outcome for Mao Asada. She is in 16th place after falling on the 3axel with really no shot of medaling.
436219594676924400,Wed Feb 19 19:23:50 +0000 2014,More interesting by the minute! Sotnikova skates perfectly and is now in second place! Anything can happen in ice skating. #surprises
436216420918386700,Wed Feb 19 19:11:13 +0000 2014,Clean short puts @AshWagner2010 in 5th place behind @GraceEGold and #Lipnitskaya. #TeamUSA could get a medal in the ladies event!
436214309858062340,Wed Feb 19 19:02:50 +0000 2014,Top quality 3flip/3toe from @CarolinaKostner moving her into 2nd! What a strong event and here comes @AshWagner2010

436207429744091140,Wed Feb 19 18:35:30 +0000 2014,I'm at the edge of my seat wondering how these girls will skate! Lipnitskaya, Kostner, Wagner, Meite, Sotnikova and Asada. Any predictions?
