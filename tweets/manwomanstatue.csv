29092061579,Fri Oct 29 14:19:42 +0000 2010,The man part of me wants to be Ehrlich for Halloween, but I can't find a dead animal large enough for a hairpiece.
29001423988,Thu Oct 28 15:53:05 +0000 2010,Sorry folks, the man woman statue does not make endorsements. But I will vote twice on Election Day.
28795797129,Tue Oct 26 14:28:16 +0000 2010,I wonder if @thestoop would let me tell a true holiday story at their December holiday shows? They do need more storytellers...

26456362036,Tue Oct 05 13:31:36 +0000 2010,Oh excellent, I'm not the only statue on Twitter. @LordBot in Williamsburg, VA, is also handy with the social media.
26456135400,Tue Oct 05 13:28:51 +0000 2010,Plus I have four hands, which makes it easy for me to multi-task.
26456112251,Tue Oct 05 13:28:34 +0000 2010,People seem shocked that even *I'm* using Twitter. But come on, today's modern statues have to be up on social media too.
