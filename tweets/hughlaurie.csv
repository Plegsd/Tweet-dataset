465990715374600200,Mon May 12 23:03:38 +0000 2014,Lord the questions... Can't a fellow buy an inflatable Michael Gove off eBay without a lot of tutting and eyebrow waggling?
465945456431095800,Mon May 12 20:03:48 +0000 2014,There is as much variety, ingenuity and madness in the wrapping techniques of eBay sellers as in all the species of the rain forest.

464424872475893760,Thu May 08 15:21:32 +0000 2014,Tired, you see. Like a down-at- heel nightclub, my brain will let any old rubbish in.
464424518945996800,Thu May 08 15:20:08 +0000 2014,But it can't be both. Zero sum game. Also, a short-legged long-penised man is probably not viable in the long run.
464422060945834000,Thu May 08 15:10:22 +0000 2014,Positioning of Singaporean urinals would seem to indicate very short legs or very long penises among the clientele.
464241808759742460,Thu May 08 03:14:07 +0000 2014,No, I don't have any liquids. But I do have plenty of solids which, historically, have had some dark episodes too. Interested? No?
464213625796689900,Thu May 08 01:22:07 +0000 2014,Tom, Dick and Harry making their way in the world. Proud parents can take a few days. Might even read one of them book type things.

459355889729024000,Thu Apr 24 15:39:13 +0000 2014,Terrific night at the Thebarton Theatre, Adelaide. Built 1927, which seems to have been a bumper year for theatres around the world. Why so?

429404700208005100,Sat Feb 01 00:03:53 +0000 2014,I had root canal treatment once. It wasn't nearly as bad as the things I'd hilariously compared it to in my cocksure youth.

428667996903854100,Wed Jan 29 23:16:29 +0000 2014,I need to untweet. Looks like Rose caught Dzeko's back foot before the ball. Still a fantastic challenge. But my apologies to Mr Marriner.

423072104188506100,Tue Jan 14 12:40:24 +0000 2014,At least it should be one in, one out. To ban smoking, you have to allow cannabis; to ban sugary drinks, allow nudism in libraries, etc.
423072016145866750,Tue Jan 14 12:40:03 +0000 2014,Good grief will people stop Calling For Things To Be Banned? Ban banning, I say, in that endearingly confused way I have.

409625930915541000,Sun Dec 08 10:10:07 +0000 2013,@TuomoMa My sympathies and congratulations for getting right back on the horse. Sort of.
409616585985245200,Sun Dec 08 09:32:59 +0000 2013,@TuomoMa Ah. I see you have a picture of yourself on a horse. The mist clears.
409612908260110340,Sun Dec 08 09:18:22 +0000 2013,@TuomoMa Surely not the same as the World Baseball international 2013, where the US came in behind DR, PR, Japan, the Netherlands and Cuba?
409612840694059000,Sun Dec 08 09:18:06 +0000 2013,@TuomoMa You minx. Cricket is played by 10 countries, including the 1.5 billion of India and Pakistan. The World Series is what, exactly?

409509728071327740,Sun Dec 08 02:28:22 +0000 2013,Sorry about that. What's the opposite of pearls before swine? Pigshit before maharajahs?
409506965161660400,Sun Dec 08 02:17:23 +0000 2013,What a lousy deal, to be an eel, How much neater, to be a cheetah? But drop a cheetah in the sea, And ask him what he'd rather be.
409495186461323260,Sun Dec 08 01:30:35 +0000 2013,Please don't soap your eels. Instead, use a damp cloth, taking care not to throw the eel across the room in disgust.

409442580523253760,Sat Dec 07 22:01:32 +0000 2013,Going to try running now. This will take 30 mins and may prolong my life by 2 mins. Or shorten it by 25 years. It's a terrible deal.

409156651019542500,Sat Dec 07 03:05:22 +0000 2013,@chiller But I said talk, not think. To talk of one's dislike merely as a way of inflating one's credentials, doesn't help anyone.
409154224820191200,Sat Dec 07 02:55:43 +0000 2013,@chiller That's a bit unfair. All I'm saying is that hating politicians is not, on its own, a principled position.

409068613123846140,Fri Dec 06 21:15:32 +0000 2013,I admire politicians. Mostly for not caring that people don't admire them. I think that's admirable.

407958519300628500,Tue Dec 03 19:44:25 +0000 2013,Never mind the arrogance. It's the savagely impertinent implication that your petty mind cannot fathom the speed and agility of mine.
407957705404710900,Tue Dec 03 19:41:11 +0000 2013,I've decided "I get it" is my phrase of the day. It even surpasses "whatever" which takes some doing.

407940455129944060,Tue Dec 03 18:32:38 +0000 2013,Imagine Harold Bloom admitting he'd only read Hamlet once:  I get it.

407939189154402300,Tue Dec 03 18:27:36 +0000 2013,But consider the saintly Pauline Kael, who only ever watched a movie once because, as she said: I get it.
407938565717229600,Tue Dec 03 18:25:07 +0000 2013,I have always tried not to be angered by critics. In the words of the tea towel: the dull and ignorant, they too have their story.

407770279557877760,Tue Dec 03 07:16:25 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon That's unbelievable. I picked completely random syllables. Honest.
407753323236708350,Tue Dec 03 06:09:02 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon You use it first, I'll back you up. Remember to roll your eyes if anyone asks what it means.
407752347620605950,Tue Dec 03 06:05:10 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon Well I don't know. It's from a universe I haven't visited. Maybe they have boolayfoosh but no jokes or music? They can keep it.
407751226668101600,Tue Dec 03 06:00:42 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon Four O's in boolayfoosh.  It's pronounced 'mip'.
407750191370870800,Tue Dec 03 05:56:35 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon Honestly, I haven't a clue. I know what I like about it, what it can do - but why? No idea. We could have evolved without it.
407750110018150400,Tue Dec 03 05:56:16 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon Then again, maybe there's a universe where they give thanks for their sense of boolayfoosh and can't imagine life without it.

407712238275805200,Tue Dec 03 03:25:47 +0000 2013,All first rate, but still, why? There are clever people who aren't funny, funny people who aren't potential mates - what's the advantage?
407700043353686000,Tue Dec 03 02:37:19 +0000 2013,I know what jokes are, and what they do to us, but why? Why do we have a sense of humor?  And yes I realise that's the non-u spelling.
407699127104180200,Tue Dec 03 02:33:41 +0000 2013,Anybody know how evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, explain jokes? What are they for, what advantage do they confer?
407585111723348000,Mon Dec 02 19:00:37 +0000 2013,Talking of directing you to things, which we also weren't, Sum by David Eagleman. Absolutely exquisite.
407584466446450700,Mon Dec 02 18:58:04 +0000 2013,Talking of horses telling their story, which we weren't, may I direct you to Kipling's The Maltese Cat?
407434486813823000,Mon Dec 02 09:02:06 +0000 2013,@andreagillies I'm sure you're right, but it's not comforting. We yearn to know ourselves more than blue yearns to know its bluest.
407368601612480500,Mon Dec 02 04:40:17 +0000 2013,Are we the same person when we've missed a night's sleep? Or a few meals? Or we're cold, or scared? If not, who are we really?
407367228145688600,Mon Dec 02 04:34:50 +0000 2013,This is not the horse. This is me with a sudden moment of vertigo. Happens every now and then.
407366380262936600,Mon Dec 02 04:31:28 +0000 2013,Lord how fragile it is. All our beliefs, opinions - piled onto a teetering pedestal of cheap food, clean water, warmth, safety. So lucky.

407263436028919800,Sun Dec 01 21:42:24 +0000 2013,And now bagpipes and Mounties. I'm such a sucker for this stuff.
407255869168963600,Sun Dec 01 21:12:20 +0000 2013,Beautiful sunny morning. Right under my window, a fantastic display by a dozen police motorcyclists. I'm 8 years old again.
407079871924289540,Sun Dec 01 09:32:59 +0000 2013,Obama's struggle with Affordable Care. He's like a prison governor asking the inmates to make lemonade for his garden party. It'll be tangy.

407077922575745000,Sun Dec 01 09:25:14 +0000 2013,That can't be it. We must all be bad and not know it. The not knowing is what makes us bad.
407077472652369900,Sun Dec 01 09:23:27 +0000 2013,Or do bad drivers meet in a different place, talk about different things?
407077142946517000,Sun Dec 01 09:22:08 +0000 2013,How many times have you heard people complain about bad drivers? No one ever holds their hand up and says I'm one of them, I'm hopeless.
406697889847865340,Sat Nov 30 08:15:07 +0000 2013,Actually, does god know? If I remember, Deuteronomy is a little sketchy on digital existentialism.

406610890339799040,Sat Nov 30 02:29:25 +0000 2013,Same used to be true of men's after shave. They put alcohol in to make it sting like hell so men could feel better about wearing perfume.
406610761201360900,Sat Nov 30 02:28:54 +0000 2013,I wonder if the notion of knots and tension has been invented to give a remedial respectability to something that is just plain nice?
406607415203745800,Sat Nov 30 02:15:36 +0000 2013,Have you ever been told by a masseur that you have no knots? No signs of tension whatsoever? Me neither. I smell a rat.
406594837639467000,Sat Nov 30 01:25:38 +0000 2013,There's one called Blossom in Winnipeg but sounds fishy. So I laid shoes on the floor and  rolled over them for a few minutes. Good as new.
406592628717654000,Sat Nov 30 01:16:51 +0000 2013,I thought about having a massage, but unfortunately can't find a qualified therapist who is neither male nor female in the Vancouver area.

406270276221947900,Fri Nov 29 03:55:56 +0000 2013,Well, heck. I tried.
406255332696932350,Fri Nov 29 02:56:33 +0000 2013,Which should have read: It's great when food is good but is it good when food is great? Although maybe that makes no more sense.
406254714276180000,Fri Nov 29 02:54:06 +0000 2013,It's great when food, but is it good when food is great?  Hmm ?? Eh????
406254457823825900,Fri Nov 29 02:53:05 +0000 2013,Crazed efforts to titillate our jaded buds looks like the last days of Rome. I wasn't there, obviously, but you know what I mean.
406254220417839100,Fri Nov 29 02:52:08 +0000 2013,I love food. Like a brother. But the creeping occupation of print and airwaves by the catering industry feels slightly decadent to me.
406229804971986940,Fri Nov 29 01:15:07 +0000 2013,Maybe it'll switch completely around. When Ted arrives, you'll say "we're being followed, darling, tan Ford with Illinois plates".
406229071975448600,Fri Nov 29 01:12:12 +0000 2013,When was the last time "we've got company" was used in a movie to mean "we've got company"? As in "darling, put the kettle on, Ted's here."
406130609598496800,Thu Nov 28 18:40:57 +0000 2013,I will sit apart from the rest with a pot of tea and a cricket bat, mourning the loss of the colonies.
406129948794306560,Thu Nov 28 18:38:19 +0000 2013,Happy thanksgiving to all Yanks. The Canadians gave thanks a month ago because they're so polite, but there'll be turkey on set tonight.
405943170225012740,Thu Nov 28 06:16:08 +0000 2013,Sorry for messing up the Roger Ackroyd thing. Now I feel like I've stripped lead off the roof of St Agatha's.

405923761406242800,Thu Nov 28 04:59:01 +0000 2013,Darn it. I made a mess of that. I'm not Ackroyd, I'm Dr Sheppard, the narrator who...oh never mind.

405819264323424260,Wed Nov 27 22:03:47 +0000 2013,Worse than that, a wet wipe who's slightly dried out. Good for nothing except analogies.
405818587215974400,Wed Nov 27 22:01:05 +0000 2013,Re-reading The Worst Journey In the World before tonight's shoot. Men were made of different stuff back then. I'm a wet wipe.

405787794498682900,Wed Nov 27 19:58:44 +0000 2013,I'm not saying better or worse - just that what we think of as judgments are often the result of mere habit.

405785232659714050,Wed Nov 27 19:48:33 +0000 2013,I meant private ownership of fireworks. Colorado for the millennium, and I couldn't buy a sparkler. But people had shotguns in the cab.
405784428326449150,Wed Nov 27 19:45:21 +0000 2013,They're horrified by a national health system yet provide universal school bus transport. Which I'm not sure they did in the USSR.
405784354397630460,Wed Nov 27 19:45:03 +0000 2013,Political belief is often no more than habit. Americans are accustomed to guns, but horrified by fireworks. Whereas we drive on the left.
405780548721078300,Wed Nov 27 19:29:56 +0000 2013,@brucehallsports I didn't physically witness all those deaths so yes, I am repeating the testimony of others; but it can still be true.

405775549936984060,Wed Nov 27 19:10:04 +0000 2013,More Americans have died from gun violence in the last 45 years than have died in all the wars the country has fought since its inception.
405773334178451460,Wed Nov 27 19:01:16 +0000 2013,No, seriously. I meant warmth. It's cold as a banker's heart here, and they were under-dressed. That's all I meant. Officer.
405772155876806660,Wed Nov 27 18:56:35 +0000 2013,10 minutes in a warm car wasn't a euphemism. Or if it was, it was only a euphemism for 5 minutes in a warm car.
405672247521972200,Wed Nov 27 12:19:35 +0000 2013,Driving back at 4am, passing hookers in strappy dresses, bare arms. You want to offer them 10 minutes In a warm car, but who'd believe that?
405579462860754940,Wed Nov 27 06:10:53 +0000 2013,Ha! I would have said, with a jaunty sneer. Call that a knife?
405579077551005700,Wed Nov 27 06:09:22 +0000 2013,One drawback of years in California - no tolerance for cold. At all. Working now in weather I would have laughed at as a young man.
405450967719477250,Tue Nov 26 21:40:18 +0000 2013,I wasted so much time tying to breed miniature celery, when the folding option was staring us all in the face. Perhaps even laughing at us.
405450008981274600,Tue Nov 26 21:36:29 +0000 2013,Tremendously excited by the prospect of a folding guitar. I have been pushing for this with celery for years. Now will they listen?
405238535004753900,Tue Nov 26 07:36:10 +0000 2013,Found my keys. They were right next to my mojo.
405235776738185200,Tue Nov 26 07:25:12 +0000 2013,No song broke the speed limit and people danced. Really danced. Even me, although I covered it by pretending to look for my keys.
405235266085871600,Tue Nov 26 07:23:11 +0000 2013,Just played in a jazz club with a lovely bunch. Katherine Penfold made grown men weep with You Don't Know Me. Happy birthday Theresa!

405138945639338000,Tue Nov 26 01:00:26 +0000 2013,I'm listening to a trumpeter now who's throwing notes at me as if I've just slept with his sister.
405132217044578300,Tue Nov 26 00:33:42 +0000 2013,Above that, there's no dancing - just nodding and showing off. Or nodding off.
405132018905669600,Tue Nov 26 00:32:54 +0000 2013,What do we think about a speed limit for jazz? Play anything faster than 200 bpm and you get a ticket.

404846107773394940,Mon Nov 25 05:36:48 +0000 2013,Paul Dacre has become, in a surprisingly short space of time, an accepted synonym for crow, or raven.
404845553131216900,Mon Nov 25 05:34:36 +0000 2013,Where do Paul Dacres go at night ? Do they nest on gothic rooftops, sneering at our petty striving hundreds of feet below?
404843190970511360,Mon Nov 25 05:25:13 +0000 2013,Which cleared up an important plot point.

404809667928657900,Mon Nov 25 03:12:00 +0000 2013,I'm wondering whether we can see ourselves in a heroic light these days.  We have so much irony tangled around our ankles. Tripping over it.

404734815054069760,Sun Nov 24 22:14:34 +0000 2013,I'm calling the crow Paul Dacre.
404733368765775900,Sun Nov 24 22:08:49 +0000 2013,Of course the crow may be telling his friends that a huge bald git just stared at him through a window. Maybe they're giving him brandy.
404731492401938400,Sun Nov 24 22:01:21 +0000 2013,What if it was Paul Dacre doing a spot of weekend shape-shifting?
404730896076795900,Sun Nov 24 21:58:59 +0000 2013,A crow the size of a huge crow just landed on my balcony and stared at me.  If I die in the next 40 years, can someone look into this?

400968884016414700,Thu Nov 14 12:50:06 +0000 2013,Many humans have chosen to die on their feet than live on their knees. Many more haven't. The rest of us are lucky not to face the choice.

400965292903641100,Thu Nov 14 12:35:50 +0000 2013,@LisaAchacon I chose labrador because that's how I heard the factoid. Labs similar size to coyote. My dog's breed is his own affair.
400963429143687200,Thu Nov 14 12:28:25 +0000 2013,Only way to tell coyote tracks from labrador is coyote's are dead straight, strictly business. Labradors frolic.  Frolicking is good.
400961661466865660,Thu Nov 14 12:21:24 +0000 2013,Which is not an argument for submission over assertiveness.  Just that it's hard for any animal to be free and splendid if it doesn't exist.
400961494185443300,Thu Nov 14 12:20:44 +0000 2013,Also a triumph of cooperation over aggression. Wolves now sadly endangered at c 100,000 v 1 bn dogs.  Tail wagging beats snarling.
400961142170079200,Thu Nov 14 12:19:20 +0000 2013,Apart from the obvious stuff, a dog also opens the door on the whole animal kingdom. Birds, ants, giraffes, all become more legible.
400960983679914000,Thu Nov 14 12:18:42 +0000 2013,What a privilege it is to have the care of a dog. Cats too, perhaps, I don't know. Chain of command less clear with  cats.

400622014849114100,Wed Nov 13 13:51:46 +0000 2013,How about this? Time senses your desire. If you want more of it, it goes faster. To slow it down, resolve to die. Or is that dark?

400610744355815400,Wed Nov 13 13:06:59 +0000 2013,Time speeding up. How do we deal with this?  Either cultivate intense boredom, or intense discomfort.  Is there a third way? No god or acid.

400055775156260860,Tue Nov 12 00:21:44 +0000 2013,Perhaps a new democracy will accompany HD. We once gazed up at silvery giants. Now all movie stars look like your sister after a hot bath.
400044656668717060,Mon Nov 11 23:37:33 +0000 2013,@Anonymously4844 Everything.  Trying to catch up on 10 yrs of British TV in one night.  I'm almost there. Just 30 more comedy panel shows.
400043834308313100,Mon Nov 11 23:34:17 +0000 2013,I predict a new kind of facial aesthetic. Symmetry and cheekbones, having dominated for millennia, will lose out to boiled egg complexions.
400042050223366140,Mon Nov 11 23:27:11 +0000 2013,It's a hopeless quest. The miracle of the brain is its ability to sift, prioritise, ignore. We don't need or want to see pores.
400036674274476000,Mon Nov 11 23:05:50 +0000 2013,I just can't love HD. Definition is of surfaces rather than shapes. All ear hair and pimples. Everyone looks like they've just been slapped.
399974532393746400,Mon Nov 11 18:58:54 +0000 2013,Shutting down now. Jet lag and vodka do not make for good tweetage.

399972914285793300,Mon Nov 11 18:52:28 +0000 2013,American men over 35 yrs and 250lbs wear goatees. It signifies individuality.

399969925844172800,Mon Nov 11 18:40:36 +0000 2013,The males have beards, of course, but they're goatees. Understandably. But makes me think of reality TV shows concerning guns and trucks.
399969240176144400,Mon Nov 11 18:37:52 +0000 2013,I never knew a goat well enough to form an opinion on his or her intellect.
399939904932937700,Mon Nov 11 16:41:18 +0000 2013,Obviously we all want sheep to achieve their potential. But we have to be realistic.
399939317768151040,Mon Nov 11 16:38:58 +0000 2013,Sheep, on the other hand, may be about as stupid as they look. Am I being unkind?

399308662038347800,Sat Nov 09 22:52:58 +0000 2013,Already sinking back into the bosom of the motherland. It's good to leave England for a while just to appreciate how beautiful it is.
399168600768266240,Sat Nov 09 13:36:25 +0000 2013,I hope the people who do the tables, seats, screens on aeroplanes don't also do the wings. Must be a different outfit, surely?
399164592276131840,Sat Nov 09 13:20:29 +0000 2013,Back in cold, wet London. Men with grey cheeks, women with red noses. Feels wonderful.

398981005895548900,Sat Nov 09 01:10:59 +0000 2013,I retract 'wading through' - exactly the sort of casual snidery I so dislike in newspapers - and substitute 'reading'. I was reading offal.
398975078131834900,Sat Nov 09 00:47:25 +0000 2013,At the airport, wading through English newspapers without any clear purpose or benefit. Might have to shower before getting on the plane.
398926211570622460,Fri Nov 08 21:33:15 +0000 2013,Cravats are different. I always assume they're concealing auto-erotic strangulation marks.
398923726688747500,Fri Nov 08 21:23:22 +0000 2013,I'm not saying bow-ties aren't cool. Just that you need to have a Subject.  Modern art, butterflies, antiques, ear infections. Something.
398917614807695360,Fri Nov 08 20:59:05 +0000 2013,Bow-ties I'm less sure about.  Maybe because I'm a jack of all trades and bow-ties are for masters of one.
398899424648110100,Fri Nov 08 19:46:48 +0000 2013,Hatlelujah was very poor. I apologise.
398899236424523800,Fri Nov 08 19:46:03 +0000 2013,Also the centre of the hat universe. It's actually possible to wear a hat unironically in New Orleans. Hatlelujah.
398885956071067650,Fri Nov 08 18:53:17 +0000 2013,Every corner oozes playing and singing of an amazing sweetness. 5 bucks in a bucket gets you better sounds than you'll hear anywhere else.
398884949773652000,Fri Nov 08 18:49:17 +0000 2013,A stroll round NO has congealed some of the wax after last night's fall. Although the buskers can make you never touch an instrument again.
398851177292378100,Fri Nov 08 16:35:05 +0000 2013,@JRhodesPianist thank you for giving any credence to this rumour.  my playing lays heavy emphasis on the pathetique...
398836183620268000,Fri Nov 08 15:35:30 +0000 2013,Icarus, that's me. The players last night were so hot, I got into a waxy, falling mess. But we raised money, and Fess's daughter was lovely.
398596250217365500,Thu Nov 07 23:42:06 +0000 2013,A parade just marched past my window. Don't know what for. Someone died, someone was born, someone bought some new socks?
398220371180007400,Wed Nov 06 22:48:29 +0000 2013,The musicians are immense and i'm lucky to be breathing the same air. But I patted Fess's bronze head and asked for his blessing. We'll see.
398216816750641150,Wed Nov 06 22:34:22 +0000 2013,Just finished rehearsal for tomorrow's show at Tip's. Ears ringing, heart pounding, hands shaking. On Fess's stage with the high priests.

397601455265165300,Tue Nov 05 05:49:08 +0000 2013,Train in the distance, maybe headed for Baton Rouge or Lafayette. Its whistle had an extra note. 1-5-7. Or am I just an old fool?
397592953364811800,Tue Nov 05 05:15:21 +0000 2013,Just saw The Milk Carton Kids. A sublime confusion of Simon+Garfunkel, the Everly Brothers, Gilbert+George, Penn+Teller... Stunningly great.

397429562591948800,Mon Nov 04 18:26:06 +0000 2013,Lusty and well-oiled crowd for the last show in Atlanta. Now the CBB retires to their cryogenic pods until 2014. Sweet sorrow.
397145236457394200,Sun Nov 03 23:36:17 +0000 2013,Confusion here.  Sorry.  Mine are notional questions we ought to be able to ask of nations.

397142721670160400,Sun Nov 03 23:26:18 +0000 2013,I mean really. Why not this way round? "I'm considering your country as a recipient of my time and effort - describe why you might qualify?"
397131097105920000,Sun Nov 03 22:40:06 +0000 2013,Quiet study time while the band fill in their visa forms for the next leg. General derision at the impertinence of government bureaucracy.
397085098358898700,Sun Nov 03 19:37:19 +0000 2013,Last toe of this leg in Atlanta GA before the CBB scatters for a few months. Keen to finish on a high.  Possibly even a good-humoured riot.
397040353981005800,Sun Nov 03 16:39:31 +0000 2013,Being English, I was born without hips, but I tried to honour the event with some racy nostril-flaring.
397039654341713900,Sun Nov 03 16:36:44 +0000 2013,The Florida Theatre was where Elvis performed in 1956 before a judge, who had to rule on the suggestiveness of the King's hip movements.

396783648533651460,Sat Nov 02 23:39:28 +0000 2013,Calm before the storm. In 30 minutes I cry 'havoc!' and then we'll see if anyone knows what I'm on about.
396745499878772740,Sat Nov 02 21:07:53 +0000 2013,And I survey the hive with a benign smile, fanning myself with my hat. I have delicate hands, you see.
396744437453176800,Sat Nov 02 21:03:39 +0000 2013,Crew just got in from Atlanta. Frayed but in good spirits. Now madly rigging, cabling, plugging. Normal service has been resumed.

396661866950582300,Sat Nov 02 15:35:33 +0000 2013,Streets filling with Gators and Bulldogs faithful. It's a hajj. Which is probably offensive but shouldn't be.
396656649890705400,Sat Nov 02 15:14:49 +0000 2013,Met 3 lads at a cafe. They played me some rap, I asked them to the show - warned them it's really old music. They said like 70s rock?
396655139144343550,Sat Nov 02 15:08:49 +0000 2013,Another stunning building. 1926 a good year for theatres. US still speckled with these gems that have somehow escaped thuggish developers.

396533757735231500,Sat Nov 02 07:06:29 +0000 2013,Truck stop in  South Carolina. Ranks of trucking elves bringing your breakfast, clothes, books, toys. All have goatees.

396343024395227140,Fri Nov 01 18:28:35 +0000 2013,Swampy drizzle in North Carolina. Raindrops seem to fall slower here than up north, meandering down with their ties loosened.  Nice.
396104166055366660,Fri Nov 01 02:39:27 +0000 2013,A night of ribs, beer, pool and shuffleboard.  Oh, how I strongly disapprove of myself.

395763920096735200,Thu Oct 31 04:07:26 +0000 2013,I offered my hand to a 10 yr old girl and she shunned it. Doesn't shake hands with men. Her parents beamed like she'd just spoken Latin.

395685989936816100,Wed Oct 30 22:57:46 +0000 2013,Beautiful theatre in Keswick PA.  Lovely vibe to the place and people. Could signify a great show or fist fights and sarcasm. The unknown.
395508355982430200,Wed Oct 30 11:11:54 +0000 2013,Truck drivers are a noble breed. Toiling through the night to bring Christmas every morning. Might try for a licence when this is over.

395406537851928600,Wed Oct 30 04:27:19 +0000 2013,Boston audience fantastic. We were good too, but the audience were better. Knowledgeable, appreciative. Also handsome and stylishly dressed.
395301092801925100,Tue Oct 29 21:28:19 +0000 2013,In Boston now, polishing brass before tonights's show. The vegans have gone out scavenging. Carnivores asleep.

395197170124849150,Tue Oct 29 14:35:22 +0000 2013,On a train NY to Boston in glorious sunshine. Can't find a single thing to moan about. I'm losing my touch.

394597064157708300,Sun Oct 27 22:50:46 +0000 2013,Calvin Theatre Northampton, wrestling with whether to do a Lou Reed song to mark his passing. The only official fan club I ever belonged to.

394529012355457000,Sun Oct 27 18:20:21 +0000 2013,In Springfield Mass., on our way to sound check. I feel like doing 6 new songs tonight, terrifying myself and everyone else. It'll pass.
394528491590668300,Sun Oct 27 18:18:17 +0000 2013,Our appetite for photos. Are we trying to hold back time? Sandbags against the flood? Or are we all NSA, doing it just because we can?

393098154712641540,Wed Oct 23 19:34:38 +0000 2013,Lovely gaggle of fans at the Birchmere. Though I'm superstitious meeting people before a show. Like seeing the bride before the wedding.
393034100778737660,Wed Oct 23 15:20:06 +0000 2013,Practicing in hotel room on electro keyboard.  But no headphones, so I can't hear what I'm doing. Ideal.
392812765288861700,Wed Oct 23 00:40:36 +0000 2013,Alexandria impossibly pretty.  Dainty colonial style, shops selling frilly scented things.  My feet feel enormous.
392716998368854000,Tue Oct 22 18:20:03 +0000 2013,600 miles south to Alexandria VA, much of it to the strains of The Last Waltz.  By God but The Band were good. Dr J's Such A Night sublime.
392488716880457700,Tue Oct 22 03:12:56 +0000 2013,Well I'll be. Monty audience looked so stern and classical, but they cut loose!  The CBB's playing has reached dizzying heights.  Thin air.
392408250034843650,Mon Oct 21 21:53:12 +0000 2013,We've stormed the Maison Symphonique in Montreal. Dressing rooms bigger than some venues we've played. Hope we can lower the tone tonight.
392363215323009000,Mon Oct 21 18:54:14 +0000 2013,Nice interviewer for CBC seemed to think I had been to Montreal before, for a golf tournament. I have instructed my lawyers.
392315493597843460,Mon Oct 21 15:44:37 +0000 2013,Actually not dead but in Montreal.  Which is a very different ball of wax.
392315114499874800,Mon Oct 21 15:43:06 +0000 2013,Woke up on empty bus parked in a vast yellow hangar with no doors or windows.  Assumed I was dead. Trippy but not unpleasant.
392132457757020160,Mon Oct 21 03:37:18 +0000 2013,Toronto unable to resist our potent mix of herbs and spices. A thumping good show. The bus has to break down now.  It's all too good...
392075729094983700,Sun Oct 20 23:51:52 +0000 2013,Danforth Music Hall Toronto.  The quiet murmur of preparation before battle is joined.  I might do something from Henry V.
391978796217159700,Sun Oct 20 17:26:42 +0000 2013,Didn't mean to insult Toronto by implying it doesn't have a lively and compelling gang problem too. Must get out more.
391958951555637250,Sun Oct 20 16:07:50 +0000 2013,Day dawns bright over typical Toronto scene. Drunks, pimps, hookers. hustlers, bikers, beggars, bootleggers. Not a single one in sight.
391867781957681150,Sun Oct 20 10:05:34 +0000 2013,Breathing Canadian air now. Minty fresh with a hint of health care. Might get a new hip while I'm here.
391804286960562200,Sun Oct 20 05:53:16 +0000 2013,What a life. Someone nicer ought to be living it.
391803945242206200,Sun Oct 20 05:51:54 +0000 2013,On the bus now, eating spicy chicken wings and watching Lightning in a Bottle. More angry than spicy. Probably cross into Canada around 5.
391799077886631940,Sun Oct 20 05:32:34 +0000 2013,Lovely crowd in Kent and we gave as good as we got.  This band can get a song quivering 10 feet off the floor and they did it tonight.
391645945688903700,Sat Oct 19 19:24:04 +0000 2013,Last occupant of this dressing room was Kevin Costner.  The air is sweet but manly. I am going to trap some in a can for later.

391411404554526700,Sat Oct 19 03:52:05 +0000 2013,Bowling in Cleveland. Badly. But it's one of those rare games: no one minds being bad.  Must be infuriating for those who can do it well.
391322873840664600,Fri Oct 18 22:00:18 +0000 2013,On reflection, being able to crash a stock market or cause a typhoon with a beat of their wings may be legacy enough.
391301140911890400,Fri Oct 18 20:33:56 +0000 2013,Then again, maybe butterflies dream of being pinned in someone's butterfly hall of fame?
391300006608519200,Fri Oct 18 20:29:26 +0000 2013,Decided against HoF, fearing the reaction I had the first time I saw butterflies pinned.
391267697809297400,Fri Oct 18 18:21:03 +0000 2013,Pulled into Cleveland 2am and slept like a dead rhino.  Now deliberating visit to RnR Hall of Fame.  Inspiring, depressing or both?
391089730986602500,Fri Oct 18 06:33:52 +0000 2013,A rule is emerging even in 3 US shows.  Men who wear white trousers to the theatre aren't happy.  Cause or effect?
391042039397093400,Fri Oct 18 03:24:22 +0000 2013,Carnegie Music Hall Pittsburgh - and a lovely audience.  A good night was well and truly had.  There's got to be a catch.
390968867125600260,Thu Oct 17 22:33:36 +0000 2013,We're trying a new version of Jon Cleary's So Damn Good tonight.  If I can hook my belt onto Herman's groove we'll be fine.
390964159040323600,Thu Oct 17 22:14:53 +0000 2013,Another great sound check. No words to describe how good this band is. I have to conceal my open-mouthed wonder or I'd be screaming all day.
390892621037850600,Thu Oct 17 17:30:37 +0000 2013,Loving the half mile of Pittsburgh I've seen.  Weighty.  Bathing my temples now in asses' milk. The air tonight shall be filled with song.

390715855962505200,Thu Oct 17 05:48:13 +0000 2013,I made a hash of Come on Baby but we gave a good account of ourselves.  Great crowd in Chicago and the band played their socks off!!
390620588035031040,Wed Oct 16 23:29:40 +0000 2013,Sound check was impossibly good.  My natural superstition makes me nervous about tonight's show.  Whisky usually helps.  To battle!!
390533958867623940,Wed Oct 16 17:45:26 +0000 2013,@EmM1013 I made that point too.  Five days squeezed into 3  hours.  We can live forever!
