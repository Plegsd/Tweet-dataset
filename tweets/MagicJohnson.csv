743666844305788900,Fri Jun 17 04:49:27 +0000 2016,If Golden State is going to win Game 7 they have to play much better on the defensive end than they did in the last 2 games.
743665955302060000,Fri Jun 17 04:45:55 +0000 2016,Golden State should feel good going into Game 7. Steph Curry found his game and Klay Thompson woke up in the 2nd half tonight.
743664731190243300,Fri Jun 17 04:41:03 +0000 2016,There are some good things the Warriors can take away from this game, especially the way they played in the 2nd half.
743663933626548200,Fri Jun 17 04:37:53 +0000 2016,I can't deny LeBron James, he's definitely on my Mt. Rushmore. He's a winner and we've never seen anybody with his all around skill set.
743662278814249000,Fri Jun 17 04:31:18 +0000 2016,I've been really impressed with Coach Lue's  decision making.
743662019740479500,Fri Jun 17 04:30:16 +0000 2016,Coach Tyronn Lue has stepped his game up, putting Kyrie &amp; LeBron in the Pick &amp; Roll, forcing the Warriors to make mistakes on defense.
743660787466543100,Fri Jun 17 04:25:22 +0000 2016,The Cavs beat the Warriors at their own game...making shots from the 3pt line and scoring fast break points.
743659304889126900,Fri Jun 17 04:19:29 +0000 2016,The Cavs had a tremendous will to win tonight. They were more physical than the Warriors and played great defense.

742572024728428500,Tue Jun 14 04:19:01 +0000 2016,After the Cavs win in Golden State tonight, I really feel that there will be a Game 7.
742571648805535700,Tue Jun 14 04:17:32 +0000 2016,The Warriors didn't play a smooth game  on offense or defense because of the absence of Draymond Green.
742569668255178800,Tue Jun 14 04:09:39 +0000 2016,The Cavs win over the Warriors tonight just shows you how much Draymond Green means to the Warriors team.
742569033346617300,Tue Jun 14 04:07:08 +0000 2016,LeBron James and Kyrie Irving become the first teammates to score over 40pts in a finals game.
742568233115385900,Tue Jun 14 04:03:57 +0000 2016,When you have a big game on the road your superstars have to dominate and that's exactly what LeBron and Kyrie did.
742567681124012000,Tue Jun 14 04:01:46 +0000 2016,Kyrie &amp; LeBron were special tonight both scoring 41pts to lead the Cavs in the Game 5 win.

742450865613635600,Mon Jun 13 20:17:35 +0000 2016,If Cleveland wins tonight, I think it will be a 7 game series.
742450528353820700,Mon Jun 13 20:16:14 +0000 2016,...Jim Chones grabbed 10rebs, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon played great defense and Brad Holland scored 8pts off the bench.
742446896166248400,Mon Jun 13 20:01:48 +0000 2016,I remember in the 1980 NBA Finals when league MVP Kareem Abdul-Jabbar got hurt in Game 5 and in Game 6 Jamaal Wilkes scored 37pts...
742436024274419700,Mon Jun 13 19:18:36 +0000 2016,I'm really intrigued to see how Golden State will play in Game 5 without Draymond Green.

741493321277657100,Sat Jun 11 04:52:38 +0000 2016,The crazy thing about the Golden State Warriors is that they are a young team that could win 3 or 4 championships in a row.
741492679729512400,Sat Jun 11 04:50:05 +0000 2016,The Cavs are going to have to make some major moves this off-season if they're going to bring a championship to Cleveland.
741490622641537000,Sat Jun 11 04:41:55 +0000 2016,The Cavs problem is that they have too many players that play offense and very few that play defense.
741488231015845900,Sat Jun 11 04:32:25 +0000 2016,Golden State returned the favor to Cleveland by playing more physical than the Cavs tonight.
741486400973897700,Sat Jun 11 04:25:08 +0000 2016,When Steph &amp; Klay are playing great together the Warriors are a hard team to beat.
741485252036595700,Sat Jun 11 04:20:34 +0000 2016,I said Steph &amp; Klay had to have big games and they did scoring 38pts &amp; 25pts respectively to lead the Warriors in the 108-97 Game 4 win.
741420425607942100,Sat Jun 11 00:02:59 +0000 2016,I can't wait to see what happens in the all-important Game 4! #NBAFinals

711711973231214600,Mon Mar 21 00:32:12 +0000 2016,The Spurs won because they ran the Warriors off of the 3pt line. I haven't seen another team in the NBA do that.

701606054879047700,Mon Feb 22 03:14:53 +0000 2016,The Cavs after a big road win over OKC led by @KingJames 25pts 7reb &amp; 11ast, look like a team that is hitting its stride under Coach Lue.

700841839885062100,Sat Feb 20 00:38:10 +0000 2016,Randy Foye to OKC definitely improves their team. He's a proven scorer, defender and will help them off the bench in the playoffs.
700840949971161100,Sat Feb 20 00:34:38 +0000 2016,Fans of my home state Detroit Pistons should be proud of the job Stan Van Gundy is doing as Pres. of Basketball Operations and Head Coach!

700832749435772900,Sat Feb 20 00:02:02 +0000 2016,Right now the Clippers are the 4th seed. If they can move up, I like their chances of making it to the Western Conference Finals.
700832263534047200,Sat Feb 20 00:00:07 +0000 2016,Now in the 4th qtr the Clippers can spread the floor with Griffin, Paul, Redick, Green and Crawford. I really like that lineup.
700830859536957400,Fri Feb 19 23:54:32 +0000 2016,The Clippers struggled because their 4th qtr lineup was not as good as the Warriors, Spurs or Thunder, adding Green changes all of that.
700830324385673200,Fri Feb 19 23:52:24 +0000 2016,The Clippers really improve their team adding Jeff Green who can play multiple positions, defend and score.
