887387281526575100,Tue Jul 18 19:03:09 +0000 2017,19. I‚Äôm not going to give up on repealing the Unaffordable Care Act. American families deserve better.
887387232407085000,Tue Jul 18 19:02:57 +0000 2017,18. I truly believe we all want what‚Äôs best for our nation and her people. To me, that‚Äôs finding a better solution than the ACA provides.
887387151549288400,Tue Jul 18 19:02:38 +0000 2017,17. But here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm not doing ‚Äì I‚Äôm not going to impugn the intentions of people who disagree
887387051666092000,Tue Jul 18 19:02:14 +0000 2017,16. You can‚Äôt just put your head in the sand and ignore those facts and hope that it lives forever
887387005155516400,Tue Jul 18 19:02:03 +0000 2017,15. Its price tag grew and grew from the billions into the trillions, and finally scoring agencies just gave up
887386956719681500,Tue Jul 18 19:01:51 +0000 2017,14. The ACA is not sustainable, and hasn‚Äôt been from the beginning. Its foundation was built on certain groups that never signed up
887386878885810200,Tue Jul 18 19:01:33 +0000 2017,13. I remain committed to repealing the ACA and replacing it with a system that works for all families
887386810388754400,Tue Jul 18 19:01:17 +0000 2017,12. So that‚Äôs where we stand today. A bad program that has grown deep roots, and a bitterly divided political culture.
887386751517560800,Tue Jul 18 19:01:03 +0000 2017,11. We‚Äôve got to realize that our pattern should not be disagree and destroy, but rather disagree and solve
887386620269383700,Tue Jul 18 19:00:31 +0000 2017,10. And two ‚Äì along the way we stopped fighting the policy, and started fighting the people behind it
887386548248948700,Tue Jul 18 19:00:14 +0000 2017,9. No matter how badly the program serves (or doesn‚Äôt serve) the people ‚Äì replacing an entitlement is hard
887386459644330000,Tue Jul 18 18:59:53 +0000 2017,8. The ACA went into effect, and ‚Äì ‚ÄúA government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we‚Äôll ever see on this earth‚Äù (Reagan)
887386367684034600,Tue Jul 18 18:59:31 +0000 2017,7. Two things happened along the way to where we stand today
887386295395393500,Tue Jul 18 18:59:14 +0000 2017,6. These are facts ‚Äì you can‚Äôt argue with them. And that‚Äôs not how our health care system should work
887386219079979000,Tue Jul 18 18:58:56 +0000 2017,5. Not everyone got to keep their doctors, and they weren‚Äôt able to keep their plans
887386155033002000,Tue Jul 18 18:58:40 +0000 2017,4. Millions are paying for insurance they don‚Äôt want. In SC, more than 100,000 stuck without an option
887386068575801300,Tue Jul 18 18:58:20 +0000 2017,3. In South Carolina, we‚Äôre down to one insurer offering plans on the exchanges.We‚Äôre seeing triple digit premium hikes,sky high deductibles
887385828145672200,Tue Jul 18 18:57:22 +0000 2017,2. The debt continues to grow, and the ACA is not getting any better. The former isn‚Äôt helped by the latter.

819958648692736000,Fri Jan 13 17:25:50 +0000 2017,A few things to clear up on Obamacare repeal. I know many Americans on both sides of the issue are anxious.
