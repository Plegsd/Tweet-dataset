578324520978804700,Wed Mar 18 22:38:05 +0000 2015,"When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?" Think on that one for a minute... @kendricklamar #ToPimpAButterfly

577191296210698200,Sun Mar 15 19:35:03 +0000 2015,How great of a song is "A Night to Remember" by @ShalamarMusic? Just a perfect soul-pop confection. So cool @jodywatley owns that name now!
577155429962281000,Sun Mar 15 17:12:32 +0000 2015,Got a feeling @JheneAiko is gonna be one of those people who makes everything she touches better, e.g. "I Know It" on the new @BigSean album
577147261714567200,Sun Mar 15 16:40:04 +0000 2015,It's another Sunday when @ChakaKhan is feeding my soul. Today's sermon:  #AskRufus. Who needs church when you got that voice?
576915805515964400,Sun Mar 15 01:20:21 +0000 2015,Can I just say that @johnlegend is on a major roll? Ten years after #GetLifted, it couldn't happen to a more deserving artist. Well earned.
576582597297455100,Sat Mar 14 03:16:18 +0000 2015,Lots of girls were all about that bass at the @Meghan_Trainor show tonight at @IrvingPlaza. And some middle-age girls too!
576490517808156700,Fri Mar 13 21:10:24 +0000 2015,Just finished a @JanetJackson marathon at the gym. Oh, how I wish she'd come back to us for 1 more album and tour. U listening Miss Jackson?
576437728423837700,Fri Mar 13 17:40:38 +0000 2015,My heart says #TheBends. My head says #OKComputer. @LoriMajewski @simonwilliam @NME

576167978825326600,Thu Mar 12 23:48:45 +0000 2015,Very cool meeting @SamWatters1 up at @IslandRecords today. I was always a Color Me Badd fan, so glad to see he's still doing his thing.
575846016467005440,Thu Mar 12 02:29:23 +0000 2015,So far I'm disappointed with the @Madonna album. I feel like most of the best songs were pre-released. But I'll give it time... #RebelHeart
573278883858010100,Thu Mar 05 00:28:31 +0000 2015,Checking out some new country at @TheCuttingRoom. @MickeyGuyton is bringing some Nashville to NYC before the other @Nashville_ABC comes on.

572232767464988700,Mon Mar 02 03:11:37 +0000 2015,I never get tired of hearing "Under Pressure." A few times this weekend! @QueenWillRock and @DavidBowieReal is about as good as it gets...
572229989485174800,Mon Mar 02 03:00:35 +0000 2015,It's been a weekend of classic rock for me. Gotta say, some of the best moments have come from @JourneyOfficial. They were kinda everything.
572224521060651000,Mon Mar 02 02:38:51 +0000 2015,I'm a day late for Black History Month, but much love to my boxing-champ uncle, Harold Johnson, as he is laid to rest http://t.co/6Qme9asoSl
570074031203987460,Tue Feb 24 04:13:35 +0000 2015,@MariahCarey "Make It Happen" always helps me push through that last 10 minutes of cardio at the gym. One of my all-time personal anthems.
569960659359821800,Mon Feb 23 20:43:05 +0000 2015,@Donwillmott that is probably true. They may not have even seen #SoundOfMusic! LOL
569960276948348900,Mon Feb 23 20:41:34 +0000 2015,@reginarobertson thanks for the love! Back atcha! xoxo

569335838582186000,Sun Feb 22 03:20:16 +0000 2015,Don't understand why #LivingForLove isn't a bigger hit for @Madonna. It's one of her best singles in forever. #Ghosttown may be even better.
569334807328632800,Sun Feb 22 03:16:10 +0000 2015,Finally got around to the new @JColeNC album and he delivers again, altho I don't love it as much as #BornSinner. #2014ForestHillSDrive

568235298544619500,Thu Feb 19 02:27:07 +0000 2015,A night to remember with @jodywatley at @BBKingBluesNYC. First her Shalamar hits, then her solos. And she's still got those Soul Train moves
565418433014419460,Wed Feb 11 07:53:54 +0000 2015,No doubt, the StevieWonderTribute blew away the actual #Grammys. What a legendary night. One highlight after another. Higher ground indeed.
565388593703956500,Wed Feb 11 05:55:19 +0000 2015,@missjillscott, @JanelleMonae and @indiaarie just took the #StevieWonderTribute to another level with "As." #Grammys #songsinthekeyoflife

565369565199466500,Wed Feb 11 04:39:43 +0000 2015,Three numbers in and the Stevie Wonder tribute is blowing my mind: @Beyonce, @edsheeran, @GaryClarkJr, Tony Bennett and @johnlegend. Wow.
565358882785349600,Wed Feb 11 03:57:16 +0000 2015,Growing up Stevie Wonder was my Beatles. So I am beyond excited this is about to go down at @LALIVE.  #legendarynight http://t.co/snybyMlSZc

564575187405119500,Mon Feb 09 00:03:08 +0000 2015,On my way to @TheGRAMMYs. Music's biggest nite never gets old. Biggest thing I'm rooting for? @Beyonce for Album of the Year. Let's do this.
564109839953952800,Sat Feb 07 17:14:01 +0000 2015,I'm late on this, but I'm on Team @ledisi with @TheGRAMMYs snub. She performed in @SelmaMovie, she should there. As much as I love @Beyonce.
564096245010927600,Sat Feb 07 16:19:59 +0000 2015,Must say, @Tip really killed it at @TheSayersClub to kick off @TheGRAMMYs weekend, And the cameo/intro by @Pharrell made it even sweeter.
559908459026874400,Tue Jan 27 02:59:13 +0000 2015,I'm feeling the new @MarkRonson album, but I kinda wish @BrunoMars was singing on the whole thing. He's tough to beat. #UptownSpecial

526894080568352800,Tue Oct 28 00:31:52 +0000 2014,I think "Blow" and "Partition" may have become my all-time favorite @Beyonce jams. (I still love me some "Déjà Vu" too, though.)
526455716543225860,Sun Oct 26 19:29:58 +0000 2014,Taking it to church this Sunday with some old-school @MariahCarey. Shout out to Clivilles &amp; Cole for this epic remix  http://t.co/2Hbf1OgYL0

520391067037073400,Fri Oct 10 01:51:13 +0000 2014,How is it that British singers like @JessieJ don't sound British at all when they sing but that accent comes out when they speak? #justsayin
520386835223433200,Fri Oct 10 01:34:24 +0000 2014,Not many singers sound better live than you would expect from their records, but @JessieJ does at @GramercyTheatre. Damn! #SweetTalker
