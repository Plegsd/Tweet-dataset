728244576390099000,Thu May 05 15:26:51 +0000 2016,@LannonR We do not currently have any announcements about availability in the UK.
728244408253096000,Thu May 05 15:26:11 +0000 2016,@Shmuelie Scrolling is the primary use. If you use press and hold on the start menu, you'll get a context menu. It depends on app support.

728243360381730800,Thu May 05 15:22:01 +0000 2016,@HeadcaseGames Save your hair. Game controllers generally don't route input on HoloLens, so apps have to be built specifically for them now.
728242872139579400,Thu May 05 15:20:05 +0000 2016,@LiquidKhaos HoloLens can be work while also wearing corrective vision glasses.
728242761183440900,Thu May 05 15:19:39 +0000 2016,@Shmuelie Yes, it's called press and hold. Just keep your index finger down. This is also used in the scroll and zoom gestures.
728242481909862400,Thu May 05 15:18:32 +0000 2016,@bc3tech Great, it looks like you're getting help (we're the same team on Twitter and in the HoloLens forums).
