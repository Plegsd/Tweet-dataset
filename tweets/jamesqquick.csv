1234945031150194700,Tue Mar 03 20:53:34 +0000 2020,@ELWillis10 fair enough, but if you don't have file storage? So trying to use serverless functions and a static site
1234944108063592400,Tue Mar 03 20:49:54 +0000 2020,If you only needed to store 10 rows of data (only 2 properties each) in the easiest way possible, what would you use?

1234930974649200600,Tue Mar 03 19:57:42 +0000 2020,Do you not have to add type="submit" to a button within a form for the user to press enter to submit the form itself?
